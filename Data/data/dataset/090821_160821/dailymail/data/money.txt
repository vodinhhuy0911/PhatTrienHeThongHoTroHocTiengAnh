Around 14 per cent of higher-rate and additional rate taxpayers fall 'into the red' for at least half the month compared to just 9 per cent of basic-rate taxpayers, data from Hargreaves Lansdown claims.

The survey of 2,000 people asked about how regularly they were either overdrawn, or owing more on a credit card than they held in their bank account.

Someone going into their overdraft by £500 all month every month for 10 years would have to stump up £1,663 in interest over the course of a decade, assuming a 39.9% interest rate.

'Going into debt isn't necessarily a reflection of how wealthy you are,' said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

'Instead, it's about the balance between what you have coming in and what you have going out.

'If you live in a bigger, more expensive home, have children in private school, and buy your essentials from Waitrose, the things you consider to be absolute essentials will cost several times that of someone in a smaller property who shops at Aldi.'

The study also found that young people aged 18-34 are more than twice as likely to be overdrawn compared with those aged 55 and over.

'Young people are most likely to dip into the red for at least two weeks each month, with one in every 10 of 18-34 year olds admitting to this, up from 7 per cent last year,' said Coles.

'The rise reflects the fact that young people have been hit particularly hard when it came to job losses and furlough during the past year.'

In terms of geography, Londoners are more likely to fall 'into the red' than any other UK region.

11 per cent of the capital's populace spend at least half the month overdrawn compared to just two per cent of people who live in the north-east.

Londoners are most likely to be in debt: 11 per cent spend at least half the month in the red versus 2 per cent of people who live in the north-east.

The research also found that households with children under 18 living at home are twice as likely to be in red than households with no under 18s present.

One in 10 households with under 18s at home were found to be overdrawn for at least two weeks each month compared to five per cent of those without any young to look after.

For those families with as many as four children at home, 28 per cent reported being in the red for at least two weeks each month.

'London is a notoriously expensive place to live, so it's hardly surprising that 11 per cent of those who live in the capital need a helping hand from their overdraft or credit card to get through each month,' said Coles.

'Likewise parents with children under 18 living at home face the higher running costs of a bigger home, along with constant financial demands from their offspring, so it's no surprise they're twice as likely to be in the red for at least two weeks a month.'

However, some results from the study might come as more of a surprise.

Whilst being single is often considered more expensive than being coupled up, with cohabitees typically able to share certain expenses, it was found that couples are more likely to be in debt than singletons.

'Some trends come from a false sense of security,' said Coles.

'This may be because couples feel more secure with two incomes to fall back on, so they're less vigilant about avoiding debts.'

The research also showed that gender has no bearing on the likelihood of falling into the red.

While FCA statistics show that men are more likely to hold credit cards or loans and women are more likely to use retail credit or high-cost loans, overall, these tend to balance one another out.

The survey showed that 7 per cent of both men and women go into the red for at least half of every month.

What are the costs of being overdrawn?

Whilst dipping into your overdraft on rare occasions is manageable, it can spiral out of control and become an expensive issue if you begin relying on it.

Going into your overdraft by £500 all month every month for 10 years would cost £1,663 in interest over the course of a decade, assuming a 39.9 per cent interest rate, according to Hargreaves Lansdown.

Being in the red by £500 for three weeks each month would cost £1,159 in interest over a decade and for a £500 overdraft for two weeks of the month, the cost would equate to £773.

One in 10 young people are in the red for at least half of every month compared to 4 per cent of those aged 55 and over.

'If you are always going into the red every month, there's no getting away from the fact that you're spending more money than you have coming in,' said Andrew Hagger personal finance expert at MoneyComms.

'If that's the case, it's worth sitting down and spending half an hour going through your bank and card statements to see where your money is going and looking for ways to cut things out or cut back so you don't have to rely on an expensive overdraft.

'Maybe consider switching your energy deal or car and home insurance for cheaper deals - that's a good start.'

What other dangers come from being overdrawn?

Other than having to pay interest, there are other potentially damaging consequences that can arise from being frequently overdrawn.

When it comes to applying for a mortgage, lender's will typically want to see your latest bank statements to help them assess your credit worthiness and therefore, anyone deemed to be reliant on their overdraft may be considered too great a risk.

'Lenders assessing a consumer for a mortgage may turn them down if they discover they are living in excess in their overdraft, particularly if they have a large facility or fall in an unarranged limit,' said Rachel Springall, personal finance expert at Moneyfacts.

'Being in the red can also upset one's mindset as it can have a negative impact on whether someone will continue to use it as they are already 'in the red anyway'.

What can you do to reduce the costs of falling into the red?

If you are someone who frequently dips into red, then choosing a current account that will subject you to lower interest rates on your overdraft might be wise.

First Direct for example, offer a current account where your first £250 of overdraft is interest free.

Whilst many banks subject customers to arranged overdraft interest rates of 39.90 per cent, some are much less pricey - Starling Bank for example offers an arranged overdraft of 15 per cent.

Another option is to consider using a credit card for some of your existing current account spending.

'Even if you don't pay your statement balance off in full the interest rate will be around 20 per cent, so likely half what you're paying on overdraft,' said Hagger.

Alternatively, if you want to pay your overdraft off in full you could consider a 0 per cent balance transfer credit card.

A balance transfer credit card allows customers to pay off debts by transferring the entire debt over to the new card, often with the promise of 0 per cent interest for a fixed period of time.

'This allows you to switch the money from your card straight to your bank account,' said Hagger, 'you'll find there is a one-off fee of around 4 per cent of the balance transferred but it still remains a cost effective way to sort out your current account.'

'Try the MBNA 0 per cent money transfer for up to 18 months with a 3.49 per cent one off fee or the Tesco Credit Card 12 months 0 per cent with a 3.99 per cent fee.'

How can you stop falling into the red?

Using an overdraft or relying on a credit card should be as a last resort and whilst its convenient to use, ultimately the best outcome is to avoid becoming dependant on it.

'There are different ways to budget but a quick and easy way is to use Money dashboard, a free mobile app where consumers can connect their accounts and clearly see their balance across cards, savings and their current accounts,' said Springall.

'Using this could help someone move funds to prevent being charged for using their overdraft and also work out where they may be overspending each month and what they could rein in.'

Our buy-to-let guide explains the essentials of property investment

Regularly update guide explains how to assess investments and make a profit

Learn about the best locations to invest in property, buy-to-let mortgages, rental yields and what tax changes mean for landlords and investors

Buy-to-let lost some of its spark in recent years but that might be about to change as new tax cuts and low mortgage rates have caused landlords to flock back to the market.

Landlords suffered a triple-whammy hit this year as three popular tax reliefs were axed or scaled back in April.

But the Chancellor's recent stamp duty cut coupled with access to cheap loans have led to a spike in investors looking to buy homes.

If you are tempted, make sure you read our 10 tips for buy-to-let guide, which is regularly updated and has helped millions of landlords over more than a decade.

The recent stamp duty cut has led to a spike in potential landlords looking to buy homes

Why invest in buy-to-let?

A world of low interest rates helps polish the attraction of buy-to-let. Returns on savings are low and mortgages are cheap.

Previously a 3 per cent stamp duty surcharge would eat a large amount of your money, while the loss of full mortgage interest tax relief now makes returns more muted than they once were.

But the Government's recent stamp duty cut has softened this blow.

Earlier this year This is Money revealed that hundreds of thousands of landlords have left the market in recent years as a result of the tax changes of recent years.

And before the pandemic hit a third of private landlords said that they were looking to sell at least one property over the next year.

However, while they will still have to pay the 3 per cent surcharge, landlords will now see their stamp duty bill significantly reduced when purchasing new property thanks to the Chancellor's measures.

While many home buyers particularly in the South East and London will undoubtedly benefit, the average landlord purchase will also see big savings.

For example as illustrated in the chart below a £400,000 second home will now only carry a stamp duty bill of £12,000 rather than £22,000.

While this is still £12,000 more than a standard house purchase due to the 3 per cent surcharge, the landlord will still now save £10,000, the same as a standard home buyer would by not paying any tax at all.

As an income investment for those with enough money to raise a big deposit buy-to-let looks attractive, especially compared to low savings rates and stock market swings.

Mortgage rates at record lows are helping buy-to-let investors make deals stack up.

But beware low rates. One day they must rise and you need to know your investment can stand that test.

Greater demand from tenants, rents that should rise with inflation and the long horizon for interest rate rises, mean many investors are still tempted by buy-to-let.

If you are planning on investing, or just want to know more, we tell you the 10 essential things to consider for a successful buy-to-let investment below.

Like any investment, buy-to-let comes with no guarantees, but for those who have more faith in bricks and mortar than stocks and shares below are This is Money's top 10 tips.

1. Research the market on buy-to-let

If you are new to buy-to-let, what do you know about the market? Do you know the risks, as well as the benefits.

Make sure buy-to-let is the investment you want. Your money might be able to perform better elsewhere.

In recent years a high-rate savings account would beat most investments. Now rates are lower, but investing in buy-to-let means tying up capital in a property that may fall in value, especially in times of economic uncertainty.

This compares to the possibility of a 5 per cent annual return from an income-based investment fund, or 3 per cent on a fixed rate savings account .

Remember that the return from an investment in funds, shares or an investment trust through an Isa will see you escape tax on income and get capital growth tax free. You will also have the ability to sell up quickly if you want.

Ten tips for buy-to-let This guide has been helping landlords make the right decision for more than a decade. It is regularly updated with new information and designed to help you assess buy-to-let properly. If you have a buy-to-let question email us at experts@thisismoney.co.uk

The flipside is that you cannot buy an unloved investment fund and set about renovating it and adding value yourself.

Investing in buy-to-let involves committing tens of thousands of pounds to a property and typically taking out a mortgage.

When house prices rise, this means it is possible to make big leveraged gains above your mortgage debt, but when they fall your deposit gets hit and the mortgage stays the same.

Property investing has paid off handsomely for many people, both in terms of income and capital gains but it is essential that you go into it with your eyes wide open, acknowledging the potential advantages and disadvantages.

If you know someone who has invested in buy-to-let or let a property before, ask them about their experiences - warts and all.

The more knowledge you have and the more research you do, the better the chance of your investment paying off.

2. Choose a promising area to invest in property

Promising does not mean most expensive or cheapest. Promising means a place where people would like to live and this can be for a variety of reasons.

Where in your town has a special appeal? If you are in a commuter belt, where has good transport? Where are the good schools for young families? Where do the students want to live?

You need to match the kind of property you can afford and want to buy with locations that people who would want to live in those homes would choose.

These questions might sound overly simplistic, but they are probably the most important aspect of a successful buy-to-let investment

In most cases people tend to invest in property close to where they live. On the plus side, they are likely to know this market better than anywhere else and can spot the kind of property and location that will do well. They also have a much better chance of keeping tabs on the property.

Yet it is also worth bearing in mind that if you are a homeowner then you are already exposed to property where you live - and looking for a different type of home in a different area might be a good move.

Landlord hit by triple hit this year Landlords suffered a triple-whammy hit in April as three popular tax reliefs were axed or scaled back as the new tax year began. Mortgage interest tax relief, capital gains tax exemptions for 'accidental' landlords - those who held onto homes they once lived in - and letting relief were all cut. The raid came as the Government fully implemented promises dating back some years, aimed at making it easier for first-time buyers to compete for properties.

3. Do the maths on buy-to-let

Before you think about looking around properties sit down with a pen and paper and write down the cost of houses you are looking at and the rent you are likely to get.

BUY-TO-LET MORTGAGE CALCULATOR Work out your monthly payments Mortgage amount: £ Interest rate: % Duration: years Mortgage type: Interest only Repayment ::: Calculate ::: Monthly payment:

Buy-to-let lenders typically want rent to cover 125 per cent of the mortgage repayments - often now 150 per cent - and most now demand 25 per cent deposits, or even larger, for rates considerably above residential mortgage deals.

The best rate buy-to-let mortgages also come with large arrangement fees.

Once you have the mortgage rate and likely rent sorted then you must be clinical in deciding whether your investment work out?

Don't forget to factor in maintenance costs.

What will happen if the property sits empty for a month or two?

These are all things to consider. Make sure you know how much the mortgage repayments will be and if it is a tracker allow for rates to rise.

The best buy-to-let mortgages Lenders scrambled to pull mortgage deals in the wake of the lockdown but there are still cheap rates out there. The cheapest buy-to-let mortgage rates are on two year fixes and for those with a big deposit they are as low as 1.19 per cent from The Mortgage Works and 1.24 per cent from Leeds Building Society. A five-year fix may be a more sensible plan for many landlords, however, and the keenest rate here is The Mortgage Work's 1.64 per cent deal. Those are low loan-to-value mortgages, however, and if you only have 25 per cent to put down the top two-year fix is 1.56 per cent from BM Solutions and the top five-year fix is 1.94 per cent from The Mortgage Works. Beware big fees though, the deals mentioned above come with charges up to £2,500. When it comes to getting a buy-to-let mortgage, a good broker will be a great help and can point you towards deals you will actually secure. To compare the best deal for your circumstances use our buy-to-let mortgage finder tool powered by broker London & Country The buy-to-let mortgage you will be offered depends on your circumstances and the lender's criteria. ideally, they prefer bigger deposits, strong rent to mortgage payments cover and healthy earnings elsewhere.

4. Shop around and get the best buy-to-let mortgage

Do not just walk into your bank and building society and ask for a mortgage. It sounds obvious, but people who do this when they need a financial product are one of the reasons why banks make billions in profit.

It pays to speak to a good independent broker when looking for a buy-to-let mortgage. They can not only talk you through what deals are available but they can also help you weigh up which one is right for you and whether to fix or track.

You should still do your own research though, so that you can go into the conversation armed with the knowledge of what sort of mortgages you should be offered.

This is Money's carefully chosen mortgage broker partner London & Country offers fee-free advice, you can find out more and use our comparison tool to find the best buy-to-let mortgage for you here.

5. Think about your target tenant

Instead of imagining whether you would like to live in your investment property, put yourself in the shoes of your target tenant.

Who are they and what do they want?If they are students, it needs to be easy to clean and comfortable but not luxurious.

If they are young professionals it should be modern and stylish but not overbearing.

If it is a family they will have plenty of their own belongings and need a blank canvas.

Remember that allowing tenants to make their mark on a property, such as by decorating, or adding pictures, or you taking out unwanted furniture makes it feel more like home.

These tenants will stay for longer, which is great news for a landlord.

It is also possible to take out an insurance policy against your tenant failing to pay the rent, usually known as rent guarantee insurance. This can cost as little as £50, and is available as a standalone product from a specialist provider, or as part of a wider landlord insurance policy.

6. Don't be greedy, go for rental yield and remember costs

We have all read the stories about buy-to-let millionaires and their huge portfolios.

BUY-TO-LET YIELD CALCULATOR This calculator shows the rental return on your investment property as a percentage of its value Property value: £ Monthly rent: £ ::: Calculate ::: Annual rent: Yield:

But while you may expect long-term house price rises, experts say invest for income not short-term capital growth.

To compare different property's values use their yield: that is annual rent received as a percentage of the purchase price.

For example, a property delivering £10,000 worth of rent that costs £200,000 has a 5 per cent yield.

Rent should be the key return for buy-to-let.

HOW TO WORK OUT THE RETURN ON YOUR BUY-TO-LET INVESTMENT Remember, if you are buying with a mortgage, rent-to-property price yield will not be the return you get. To work out your annual return on investment subtract your annual mortgage cost from your annual rent and then work this sum out as a percentage of the deposit you put down. For a £100,000 property that could rent for £500 per month, you would need a £25k deposit and roughly £2,000 in buying costs. £75k mortgage at 5% interest rate = £312.50 £500 rental income x 12 = £6,000 Difference = £2,250 Deposit + buying costs = £27k Annual return = 8.3% Don't forget tax, maintenance costs and other landlord expenses will eat into that return.

Most buy-to-let mortgages are done on an interest-only basis, so the amount borrowed will not be paid off over time.

If you can get a rental return substantially over the mortgage payments, then once you have built up a good emergency fund, you can start saving or investing any extra cash.

Remember though, people rarely buy a home outright and they come with running costs, so mortgage costs, maintenance and agents fees must be worked out and they will eat into your return.

You may want to consider whether buy-to-let still beats an investment fund or trust once these costs are taken into account.

Once mortgage, costs and tax are considered, you will want the rent to build up over time and then potentially be able to use it as a deposit for further investments, or to pay off the mortgage at the end of its term.

This means you will have benefited from the income from rent, paid off the mortgage and hold the property's full capital value.

7. Look further afield or doing a property up

Most buy-to-let investors look for properties near where they live. But your town may not be the best investment.

The advantage of a property close by is being able to keep an eye on it, but if you will be employing an agent anyway they should do that for you.

Cast your net wider and look at towns with good commuting links, that are popular with families or have a sizeable university.

It is also worth looking at properties that need improvement as a way of boosting the value of your investment. Tired properties or those in need of renovation can be negotiated hard on to get at a better price and then spruced up to add value.

This is one way that it is still possible to see a solid and swift return on your capital invested. If you can add some value to a home straight away then it gives you a greater margin of safety on your investment

However, remember to ensure that the price is low enough to cover refurbishment and some profit and that you allow for the inevitable over-run on costs.

A good rule to follow is the property developers' rough calculation, whereby you want the final value of a refurbished property to be at least the purchase price, plus cost of work, plus 20 per cent.

8. Haggle over price when investing in property

As a buy-to-let investor you have the same advantage as a first-time buyer when it comes to negotiating a discount.

If you are not reliant on selling a property to buy another, then you are not part of a chain and represent less of a risk of a sale falling through.

This can be a major asset when negotiating a discount. Make low offers and do not get talked into overpaying.

It pays to know your market when negotiating. For example, if the market is softer and homes are taking longer to sell you will be better able to negotiate. It is also useful to find out why someone is selling and how long they have owned the property.

An existing landlord who has owned a property for a long time - and is cashing in their capital gains -may be more willing to accept a lower offer for a quick sale than a family that needs the best possible price in order to afford a move.

9. Know the pitfalls of buy-to-let

Before you make any investment you should always investigate the negative aspects as well as the positive.

House prices are on the up right now but growth has slowed and they could fall again. If property prices dip will you be able to continue holding your investment?

Meanwhile, rates are low at the moment and that is encouraging people to invest with rent comfortable covering the mortgage, but what will you do when rates rise?

Consider too the standard variable rate you may move to after a fixed rate period. What will happen if you can't remortgage?

Even in popular areas properties can sit empty. One rule of thumb many buy-to-let investors apply is to factor in the property sitting empty for two months of the year - this gives a substantial buffer.

Homes often need repairing and things can go wrong. If you do not have enough in the bank to cover a major repair to your property, such as a new boiler, do not invest yet.

10. Consider how hands-on a landlord you want to be

Buying a property is only the first step. Will you rent it out yourself or get an agent to do so.

Agents will charge you a management fee, but will deal with any problems and have a good network of plumbers, electricians and other workers if things go wrong.

You can make more money by renting the property out yourself but be prepared to give up weekends and evenings on viewings, advertising and repairs.

If you choose an agent you do not have to go for a High Street presence, many independent agents offer an excellent and personal service.

Select a shortlist of agents big and small and ask them what they can offer you.

If you are considering going it alone look at where you will advertise your property and where you will get documents, such as tenancy agreements from.

It really pays to look after your tenants. Do this and they will look after you.

The biggest drag on many buy-to-let landlord's investment returns is the void period. A time when you don't have anyone in the property. Good tenants who want to stay help avoid this - and if they move on they may even recommend your property to someone they know.

Keep up with maintenance, make sure your property is a nice place to live and try and build a good personal relationship with your tenants.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Our assistant editor Lee Boyce picks his five favourite cash Isas for savers in 2021 - essential reading to help you choose a top savings account for your money.

This top Isa round-up has keeping our readers updated on the best savings deals since 2014 - and is kept up-to-date throughout the year - bookmark it for the very latest developments.

How an Isa works and why you should have one

Each year in April, savers are given a fresh Isa allowance that qualifies for tax-free interest.

For the 2021/22 financial year, starting 6 April 2021, the limit is £20,000.

Piggy five: We round-up the best tax-free deals - and it is slim pickings at the moment

You can transfer Isa money whichever way you wish between an investment account to savings account, whereas previously you could only shift it from saving to investments.

Although cash Isas don't currently offer fantastic rates, it is still worthwhile opening one to shield money away from the taxman.

Isa rules state you can only contribute to one Isa per tax year.

You can also transfer an old Isa for better returns. Here's a quick guide to Isa saving.

It is possible to switch your current year's cash Isa if you move the entire amount, but it is far simpler to get your choice right in the first place.

Rates are low and that makes the best Isa more important

Banks and building societies should be apologising to savers for the slim pickings on offer here.

The best buy easy-access rate on a tax-free account has plunged under 1 per cent for the first time while no major bank comes close to featuring on the list.

It also comes at a time as inflation races higher, leaving all savers with a serious headache.

Savings rates really are dire at the moment and unfortunately, institutions are doing little to shelter savers from the assault of the low interest rate environment.

The coronavirus crisis cut to 0.1 per cent for the base rate, launch of a new funding scheme to pump cheap money to banks, and expansion of quantitative easing, has made things even worse.

Many now ask themselves why bother?

Yet when rates are low it becomes even more important to make sure you are getting as much as you can from your savings.

We also think an Isa is still worth having, despite the new tax-free savings interest allowance of £1,000 a year for basic rate taxpayers and £500 for higher rate taxpayers.

It's tough to get that much interest now, but one day rates will rise.

Money sheltered in an Isa will deliver a tax-free income, even above that £1,000 level and if you are building up a long-term pot, you may one day be very grateful for that.

And who knows if the personal savings allowance will be around forever - it is much more likely to disappear than the Isa wrapper.

You may also want to look into stocks and shares version of an Isa - how to choose the best (and cheapest) DIY investing Isa.

Our buy-to-let guide explains the essentials of property investment

Regularly update guide explains how to assess investments and make a profit

Learn about the best locations to invest in property, buy-to-let mortgages, rental yields and what tax changes mean for landlords and investors

Buy-to-let lost some of its spark in recent years but that might be about to change as new tax cuts and low mortgage rates have caused landlords to flock back to the market.

Landlords suffered a triple-whammy hit this year as three popular tax reliefs were axed or scaled back in April.

But the Chancellor's recent stamp duty cut coupled with access to cheap loans have led to a spike in investors looking to buy homes.

If you are tempted, make sure you read our 10 tips for buy-to-let guide, which is regularly updated and has helped millions of landlords over more than a decade.

The recent stamp duty cut has led to a spike in potential landlords looking to buy homes

Why invest in buy-to-let?

A world of low interest rates helps polish the attraction of buy-to-let. Returns on savings are low and mortgages are cheap.

Previously a 3 per cent stamp duty surcharge would eat a large amount of your money, while the loss of full mortgage interest tax relief now makes returns more muted than they once were.

But the Government's recent stamp duty cut has softened this blow.

Earlier this year This is Money revealed that hundreds of thousands of landlords have left the market in recent years as a result of the tax changes of recent years.

And before the pandemic hit a third of private landlords said that they were looking to sell at least one property over the next year.

However, while they will still have to pay the 3 per cent surcharge, landlords will now see their stamp duty bill significantly reduced when purchasing new property thanks to the Chancellor's measures.

While many home buyers particularly in the South East and London will undoubtedly benefit, the average landlord purchase will also see big savings.

For example as illustrated in the chart below a £400,000 second home will now only carry a stamp duty bill of £12,000 rather than £22,000.

While this is still £12,000 more than a standard house purchase due to the 3 per cent surcharge, the landlord will still now save £10,000, the same as a standard home buyer would by not paying any tax at all.

As an income investment for those with enough money to raise a big deposit buy-to-let looks attractive, especially compared to low savings rates and stock market swings.

Mortgage rates at record lows are helping buy-to-let investors make deals stack up.

But beware low rates. One day they must rise and you need to know your investment can stand that test.

Greater demand from tenants, rents that should rise with inflation and the long horizon for interest rate rises, mean many investors are still tempted by buy-to-let.

If you are planning on investing, or just want to know more, we tell you the 10 essential things to consider for a successful buy-to-let investment below.

Like any investment, buy-to-let comes with no guarantees, but for those who have more faith in bricks and mortar than stocks and shares below are This is Money's top 10 tips.

1. Research the market on buy-to-let

If you are new to buy-to-let, what do you know about the market? Do you know the risks, as well as the benefits.

Make sure buy-to-let is the investment you want. Your money might be able to perform better elsewhere.

In recent years a high-rate savings account would beat most investments. Now rates are lower, but investing in buy-to-let means tying up capital in a property that may fall in value, especially in times of economic uncertainty.

This compares to the possibility of a 5 per cent annual return from an income-based investment fund, or 3 per cent on a fixed rate savings account .

Remember that the return from an investment in funds, shares or an investment trust through an Isa will see you escape tax on income and get capital growth tax free. You will also have the ability to sell up quickly if you want.

Ten tips for buy-to-let This guide has been helping landlords make the right decision for more than a decade. It is regularly updated with new information and designed to help you assess buy-to-let properly. If you have a buy-to-let question email us at experts@thisismoney.co.uk

The flipside is that you cannot buy an unloved investment fund and set about renovating it and adding value yourself.

Investing in buy-to-let involves committing tens of thousands of pounds to a property and typically taking out a mortgage.

When house prices rise, this means it is possible to make big leveraged gains above your mortgage debt, but when they fall your deposit gets hit and the mortgage stays the same.

Property investing has paid off handsomely for many people, both in terms of income and capital gains but it is essential that you go into it with your eyes wide open, acknowledging the potential advantages and disadvantages.

If you know someone who has invested in buy-to-let or let a property before, ask them about their experiences - warts and all.

The more knowledge you have and the more research you do, the better the chance of your investment paying off.

2. Choose a promising area to invest in property

Promising does not mean most expensive or cheapest. Promising means a place where people would like to live and this can be for a variety of reasons.

Where in your town has a special appeal? If you are in a commuter belt, where has good transport? Where are the good schools for young families? Where do the students want to live?

You need to match the kind of property you can afford and want to buy with locations that people who would want to live in those homes would choose.

These questions might sound overly simplistic, but they are probably the most important aspect of a successful buy-to-let investment

In most cases people tend to invest in property close to where they live. On the plus side, they are likely to know this market better than anywhere else and can spot the kind of property and location that will do well. They also have a much better chance of keeping tabs on the property.

Yet it is also worth bearing in mind that if you are a homeowner then you are already exposed to property where you live - and looking for a different type of home in a different area might be a good move.

Landlord hit by triple hit this year Landlords suffered a triple-whammy hit in April as three popular tax reliefs were axed or scaled back as the new tax year began. Mortgage interest tax relief, capital gains tax exemptions for 'accidental' landlords - those who held onto homes they once lived in - and letting relief were all cut. The raid came as the Government fully implemented promises dating back some years, aimed at making it easier for first-time buyers to compete for properties.

3. Do the maths on buy-to-let

Before you think about looking around properties sit down with a pen and paper and write down the cost of houses you are looking at and the rent you are likely to get.

BUY-TO-LET MORTGAGE CALCULATOR Work out your monthly payments Mortgage amount: £ Interest rate: % Duration: years Mortgage type: Interest only Repayment ::: Calculate ::: Monthly payment:

Buy-to-let lenders typically want rent to cover 125 per cent of the mortgage repayments - often now 150 per cent - and most now demand 25 per cent deposits, or even larger, for rates considerably above residential mortgage deals.

The best rate buy-to-let mortgages also come with large arrangement fees.

Once you have the mortgage rate and likely rent sorted then you must be clinical in deciding whether your investment work out?

Don't forget to factor in maintenance costs.

What will happen if the property sits empty for a month or two?

These are all things to consider. Make sure you know how much the mortgage repayments will be and if it is a tracker allow for rates to rise.

The best buy-to-let mortgages Lenders scrambled to pull mortgage deals in the wake of the lockdown but there are still cheap rates out there. The cheapest buy-to-let mortgage rates are on two year fixes and for those with a big deposit they are as low as 1.19 per cent from The Mortgage Works and 1.24 per cent from Leeds Building Society. A five-year fix may be a more sensible plan for many landlords, however, and the keenest rate here is The Mortgage Work's 1.64 per cent deal. Those are low loan-to-value mortgages, however, and if you only have 25 per cent to put down the top two-year fix is 1.56 per cent from BM Solutions and the top five-year fix is 1.94 per cent from The Mortgage Works. Beware big fees though, the deals mentioned above come with charges up to £2,500. When it comes to getting a buy-to-let mortgage, a good broker will be a great help and can point you towards deals you will actually secure. To compare the best deal for your circumstances use our buy-to-let mortgage finder tool powered by broker London & Country The buy-to-let mortgage you will be offered depends on your circumstances and the lender's criteria. ideally, they prefer bigger deposits, strong rent to mortgage payments cover and healthy earnings elsewhere.

4. Shop around and get the best buy-to-let mortgage

Do not just walk into your bank and building society and ask for a mortgage. It sounds obvious, but people who do this when they need a financial product are one of the reasons why banks make billions in profit.

It pays to speak to a good independent broker when looking for a buy-to-let mortgage. They can not only talk you through what deals are available but they can also help you weigh up which one is right for you and whether to fix or track.

You should still do your own research though, so that you can go into the conversation armed with the knowledge of what sort of mortgages you should be offered.

This is Money's carefully chosen mortgage broker partner London & Country offers fee-free advice, you can find out more and use our comparison tool to find the best buy-to-let mortgage for you here.

5. Think about your target tenant

Instead of imagining whether you would like to live in your investment property, put yourself in the shoes of your target tenant.

Who are they and what do they want?If they are students, it needs to be easy to clean and comfortable but not luxurious.

If they are young professionals it should be modern and stylish but not overbearing.

If it is a family they will have plenty of their own belongings and need a blank canvas.

Remember that allowing tenants to make their mark on a property, such as by decorating, or adding pictures, or you taking out unwanted furniture makes it feel more like home.

These tenants will stay for longer, which is great news for a landlord.

It is also possible to take out an insurance policy against your tenant failing to pay the rent, usually known as rent guarantee insurance. This can cost as little as £50, and is available as a standalone product from a specialist provider, or as part of a wider landlord insurance policy.

6. Don't be greedy, go for rental yield and remember costs

We have all read the stories about buy-to-let millionaires and their huge portfolios.

BUY-TO-LET YIELD CALCULATOR This calculator shows the rental return on your investment property as a percentage of its value Property value: £ Monthly rent: £ ::: Calculate ::: Annual rent: Yield:

But while you may expect long-term house price rises, experts say invest for income not short-term capital growth.

To compare different property's values use their yield: that is annual rent received as a percentage of the purchase price.

For example, a property delivering £10,000 worth of rent that costs £200,000 has a 5 per cent yield.

Rent should be the key return for buy-to-let.

HOW TO WORK OUT THE RETURN ON YOUR BUY-TO-LET INVESTMENT Remember, if you are buying with a mortgage, rent-to-property price yield will not be the return you get. To work out your annual return on investment subtract your annual mortgage cost from your annual rent and then work this sum out as a percentage of the deposit you put down. For a £100,000 property that could rent for £500 per month, you would need a £25k deposit and roughly £2,000 in buying costs. £75k mortgage at 5% interest rate = £312.50 £500 rental income x 12 = £6,000 Difference = £2,250 Deposit + buying costs = £27k Annual return = 8.3% Don't forget tax, maintenance costs and other landlord expenses will eat into that return.

Most buy-to-let mortgages are done on an interest-only basis, so the amount borrowed will not be paid off over time.

If you can get a rental return substantially over the mortgage payments, then once you have built up a good emergency fund, you can start saving or investing any extra cash.

Remember though, people rarely buy a home outright and they come with running costs, so mortgage costs, maintenance and agents fees must be worked out and they will eat into your return.

You may want to consider whether buy-to-let still beats an investment fund or trust once these costs are taken into account.

Once mortgage, costs and tax are considered, you will want the rent to build up over time and then potentially be able to use it as a deposit for further investments, or to pay off the mortgage at the end of its term.

This means you will have benefited from the income from rent, paid off the mortgage and hold the property's full capital value.

7. Look further afield or doing a property up

Most buy-to-let investors look for properties near where they live. But your town may not be the best investment.

The advantage of a property close by is being able to keep an eye on it, but if you will be employing an agent anyway they should do that for you.

Cast your net wider and look at towns with good commuting links, that are popular with families or have a sizeable university.

It is also worth looking at properties that need improvement as a way of boosting the value of your investment. Tired properties or those in need of renovation can be negotiated hard on to get at a better price and then spruced up to add value.

This is one way that it is still possible to see a solid and swift return on your capital invested. If you can add some value to a home straight away then it gives you a greater margin of safety on your investment

However, remember to ensure that the price is low enough to cover refurbishment and some profit and that you allow for the inevitable over-run on costs.

A good rule to follow is the property developers' rough calculation, whereby you want the final value of a refurbished property to be at least the purchase price, plus cost of work, plus 20 per cent.

8. Haggle over price when investing in property

As a buy-to-let investor you have the same advantage as a first-time buyer when it comes to negotiating a discount.

If you are not reliant on selling a property to buy another, then you are not part of a chain and represent less of a risk of a sale falling through.

This can be a major asset when negotiating a discount. Make low offers and do not get talked into overpaying.

It pays to know your market when negotiating. For example, if the market is softer and homes are taking longer to sell you will be better able to negotiate. It is also useful to find out why someone is selling and how long they have owned the property.

An existing landlord who has owned a property for a long time - and is cashing in their capital gains -may be more willing to accept a lower offer for a quick sale than a family that needs the best possible price in order to afford a move.

9. Know the pitfalls of buy-to-let

Before you make any investment you should always investigate the negative aspects as well as the positive.

House prices are on the up right now but growth has slowed and they could fall again. If property prices dip will you be able to continue holding your investment?

Meanwhile, rates are low at the moment and that is encouraging people to invest with rent comfortable covering the mortgage, but what will you do when rates rise?

Consider too the standard variable rate you may move to after a fixed rate period. What will happen if you can't remortgage?

Even in popular areas properties can sit empty. One rule of thumb many buy-to-let investors apply is to factor in the property sitting empty for two months of the year - this gives a substantial buffer.

Homes often need repairing and things can go wrong. If you do not have enough in the bank to cover a major repair to your property, such as a new boiler, do not invest yet.

10. Consider how hands-on a landlord you want to be

Buying a property is only the first step. Will you rent it out yourself or get an agent to do so.

Agents will charge you a management fee, but will deal with any problems and have a good network of plumbers, electricians and other workers if things go wrong.

You can make more money by renting the property out yourself but be prepared to give up weekends and evenings on viewings, advertising and repairs.

If you choose an agent you do not have to go for a High Street presence, many independent agents offer an excellent and personal service.

Select a shortlist of agents big and small and ask them what they can offer you.

If you are considering going it alone look at where you will advertise your property and where you will get documents, such as tenancy agreements from.

It really pays to look after your tenants. Do this and they will look after you.

The biggest drag on many buy-to-let landlord's investment returns is the void period. A time when you don't have anyone in the property. Good tenants who want to stay help avoid this - and if they move on they may even recommend your property to someone they know.

Keep up with maintenance, make sure your property is a nice place to live and try and build a good personal relationship with your tenants.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The average mortgage rate is starting to edge down, as lenders bring back their full range of products and launch tantalising deals with interest of less than 1 per cent for those with lots of equity or big deposits.

For the first time in a year, both the average two-year and five-year fixed rate fell in July, according to finance experts Moneyfacts.

Typical two-year fixes are now sitting at 2.55 per cent and 2.78 per cent respectively, having reduced by 0.04 per cent in the previous month.

They are still higher than their equivalent rates year-on-year, as July 2020 saw record lows of 1.99 per cent and 2.25 per cent – though those figures were skewed by lenders removing higher-interest, low-deposit mortgages from the market during the pandemic.

The number of mortgage deals available to borrowers has now risen to its highest level since March 2020, at 4,500.

The mortgage market is opening up again after deals were pulled at the start of the pandemic

There is some good news for first-time buyers, who have had a much harder time finding a mortgage since low-deposit deals were pulled at the beginning of the pandemic.

Mortgages for those with ten per cent deposits started to return to the market at the beginning of this year, and there are now 538 products available. In July 2020, there were just 70.

More recently, lenders have begun to relaunch five per cent deposit mortgages, and there are now 253 of these to choose from.

The Government is underwriting deals with some lenders under a new mortgage guarantee scheme, and this has given other banks and building societies the confidence to launch their own low-deposit offerings.

However, first-time buyers might find themselves paying almost four times as much interest as a home mover with a large deposit.

The typical two-year fixed rate on a 5 per cent deposit mortgage is 3.79 per cent, according to Moneyfacts, while those with 40 per cent deposits can take advantage of rates as low as 0.94 per cent.

What are the best mortgage deals?

With mortgage rates hitting record lows for some borrowers, it could pay to switch.

Borrowers on their lenders' standard variable rates could save hundreds of pounds a month by taking a new deal, for example.

Mark Gordon, director of money at Compare the Market, said: 'Languishing on a lender's standard variable rate mortgage is likely to cost you thousands of pounds more than you need to pay.

'While there are fewer mortgage products available on the market than usual at the moment, with the housing market slowly restarting again and physical property valuations able to take place once more, there are still plenty of good rates to choose from by looking around online.'

The attraction of a two-year fix may be lower rates now and extra flexibility, but that comes at the expense of needing to remortgage in two years to avoid slipping onto a more expensive standard variable rate.

A five-year fix gives the opportunity to lock into a low rate for a longer period and avoid extra fees and higher rates in a relatively short time.

Unless you have a good reason to take a two-year fixed rate, such as needing to move or expecting to have to sell your home, brokers have suggested that five-year fixed rates might be a cheaper long-term bet.

A note on rates Rates can change on mortgages at short notice and sadly lenders do not always inform us when they alter them (especially if they raise rates rather than lower them). This can lead to occasions when the rates listed here are not available. If you ever spot this situation - or a good rate we have not listed - please email editor@thisismoney.co.uk with mortgage rates in the subject line and we will update the round-up asap.

Best tracker rate mortgages

Tracking a 0.10 per cent Base Rate may seem an odd decision when rates are likely to only go up - and you could fix for up to five years at a lower rate - however, there is one big advantage to a good lifetime tracker: flexibility.

A fixed-rate mortgage will almost inevitably carry early repayment charges, meaning you will be limited as to how much you can overpay, or face potentially thousands of pounds in fees if you opt to leave before the initial deal period is up.

You should be able to take a good fixed mortgage with you if you move, as most are portable, but there is no guarantee your new property will be eligible or you may even have a gap between ownership.

A good lifetime tracker has no early repayment charges, you can up sticks whenever you want and that suits some people.

Make sure you stress test yourself against a sharper rise in base rate than is forecast.

Lifetime trackers

Melton BS has a lifetime discounted variable rate at its SVR minus 3.00 per cent for the term, currently at 1.99 per cent with fees of £290 at 75 per cent loan-to-value

First Direct has a tracker at base plus 2.09 per cent for the term, currently at 2.19 per cent with fees of £490 at 60 per cent loan-to-value

Shorter trackers

Natwest has a two-year tracker at base plus 0.90 per cent with fees of £745 at 75 per cent loan-to-value

Leek BS has a two-year discounted variable rate at its SVR minus 4.20 per cent, currently at 0.99 per cent, with fees of £1,495 at 75 per cent loan-to-value

Watch out for discount rates, as these track a rate set by the lender rather than following the path of the Bank of England base rate.

Most lenders move their internal variable rate in line with the base rate, but they don't have to, meaning you could see your rate rise even if the base rate stays put.

Can you get a mortgage?

Getting a mortgage is tougher than it once was. You will need to get your finances in order and be prepared for the lengthier application process and in-depth affordability interviews getting a mortgage requires nowadays.

Lenders also apply different standards to what they will lend.

Weigh up the above, check the rates here and in our best buy mortgage tables, have a scout around what the best deals look like – and speak to a good independent broker.

There are a couple of things to look out for if you do decide to fix.

You need to check the bumper arrangement fees are worth paying – if you don't have a big mortgage you may be better off with a slightly higher rate and lower fee.

It's also wise to think carefully about whether you expect to move home soon. A good five-year fix should be portable, so you can take it with you.

But your new property will need to be assessed and you might need to borrow extra money, and so your lender could still say no. Getting out of a fixed rate typically requires a hefty hit to the pocket from early repayment charges.

Today's low rates may stick around, they may even inch a little lower, but they may also be swiftly axed.

If you think you'd kick yourself if you miss out on one, then set aside some time to consider what to do.

Choosing a mortgage - the essential quick guide

1. How big a deposit do I need?

To get the full choice of deals raising a decent deposit is still vital. The benchmark figure is 25 per cent, if you have this then you'll be getting close to the best rates, although for an absolute cheapest deal you're still likely to need 40 per cent.

However, a selection of better deals for smaller deposits is also now available.

2. Should I take a fixed rate?

Most borrowers consider the security of a fixed rate as worthwhile, whereas variable rate deals can be cheaper but leave you exposed to potential rate rises.

If you decide to take a fix you need to carefully consider how long for.

Two-year deals are cheap but only offer very short-term security and incur extra costs when you remortgage.

Five-year deals lock you in for longer and come with slightly higher rates but better security and no need to remortgage in a relatively short space of time.

3. Should I take a tracker rate?

Tracker rates are essentially a gamble. What looks like a bargain rate now, could soon get very expensive when interest rates rise.

Anyone considering a tracker needs to make sure they are not just storing up a problem for the future. If the tracker comes with an early redemption penalty that would make it expensive to jump ship, then make sure your finances could take a rise of at least 2 per cent to 3 per cent in interest rates.

For that reason we at This is Money like tracker deals that fit into one of these three categories: no early redemption penalties, a cap to how high the rate will go, or that let you jump ship for a fixed rate if rates rise.

4. Should I get off a standard variable rate?

Standard variable rates are what borrowers slip onto by default when they finish a fixed or tracker deal period.

They can typically be changed by lenders at any time - without the Bank of England moving rates, they may also rise or fall by more than any move in base rate.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Our assistant editor Lee Boyce picks his five favourite cash Isas for savers in 2021 - essential reading to help you choose a top savings account for your money.

This top Isa round-up has keeping our readers updated on the best savings deals since 2014 - and is kept up-to-date throughout the year - bookmark it for the very latest developments.

How an Isa works and why you should have one

Each year in April, savers are given a fresh Isa allowance that qualifies for tax-free interest.

For the 2021/22 financial year, starting 6 April 2021, the limit is £20,000.

Piggy five: We round-up the best tax-free deals - and it is slim pickings at the moment

You can transfer Isa money whichever way you wish between an investment account to savings account, whereas previously you could only shift it from saving to investments.

Although cash Isas don't currently offer fantastic rates, it is still worthwhile opening one to shield money away from the taxman.

Isa rules state you can only contribute to one Isa per tax year.

You can also transfer an old Isa for better returns. Here's a quick guide to Isa saving.

It is possible to switch your current year's cash Isa if you move the entire amount, but it is far simpler to get your choice right in the first place.

Rates are low and that makes the best Isa more important

Banks and building societies should be apologising to savers for the slim pickings on offer here.

The best buy easy-access rate on a tax-free account has plunged under 1 per cent for the first time while no major bank comes close to featuring on the list.

It also comes at a time as inflation races higher, leaving all savers with a serious headache.

Savings rates really are dire at the moment and unfortunately, institutions are doing little to shelter savers from the assault of the low interest rate environment.

The coronavirus crisis cut to 0.1 per cent for the base rate, launch of a new funding scheme to pump cheap money to banks, and expansion of quantitative easing, has made things even worse.

Many now ask themselves why bother?

Yet when rates are low it becomes even more important to make sure you are getting as much as you can from your savings.

We also think an Isa is still worth having, despite the new tax-free savings interest allowance of £1,000 a year for basic rate taxpayers and £500 for higher rate taxpayers.

It's tough to get that much interest now, but one day rates will rise.

Money sheltered in an Isa will deliver a tax-free income, even above that £1,000 level and if you are building up a long-term pot, you may one day be very grateful for that.

And who knows if the personal savings allowance will be around forever - it is much more likely to disappear than the Isa wrapper.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The average mortgage rate is starting to edge down, as lenders bring back their full range of products and launch tantalising deals with interest of less than 1 per cent for those with lots of equity or big deposits.

For the first time in a year, both the average two-year and five-year fixed rate fell in July, according to finance experts Moneyfacts.

Typical two-year fixes are now sitting at 2.55 per cent and 2.78 per cent respectively, having reduced by 0.04 per cent in the previous month.

They are still higher than their equivalent rates year-on-year, as July 2020 saw record lows of 1.99 per cent and 2.25 per cent – though those figures were skewed by lenders removing higher-interest, low-deposit mortgages from the market during the pandemic.

The number of mortgage deals available to borrowers has now risen to its highest level since March 2020, at 4,500.

The mortgage market is opening up again after deals were pulled at the start of the pandemic

There is some good news for first-time buyers, who have had a much harder time finding a mortgage since low-deposit deals were pulled at the beginning of the pandemic.

Mortgages for those with ten per cent deposits started to return to the market at the beginning of this year, and there are now 538 products available. In July 2020, there were just 70.

More recently, lenders have begun to relaunch five per cent deposit mortgages, and there are now 253 of these to choose from.

The Government is underwriting deals with some lenders under a new mortgage guarantee scheme, and this has given other banks and building societies the confidence to launch their own low-deposit offerings.

However, first-time buyers might find themselves paying almost four times as much interest as a home mover with a large deposit.

The typical two-year fixed rate on a 5 per cent deposit mortgage is 3.79 per cent, according to Moneyfacts, while those with 40 per cent deposits can take advantage of rates as low as 0.94 per cent.

What are the best mortgage deals?

With mortgage rates hitting record lows for some borrowers, it could pay to switch.

Borrowers on their lenders' standard variable rates could save hundreds of pounds a month by taking a new deal, for example.

Mark Gordon, director of money at Compare the Market, said: 'Languishing on a lender's standard variable rate mortgage is likely to cost you thousands of pounds more than you need to pay.

'While there are fewer mortgage products available on the market than usual at the moment, with the housing market slowly restarting again and physical property valuations able to take place once more, there are still plenty of good rates to choose from by looking around online.'

The attraction of a two-year fix may be lower rates now and extra flexibility, but that comes at the expense of needing to remortgage in two years to avoid slipping onto a more expensive standard variable rate.

A five-year fix gives the opportunity to lock into a low rate for a longer period and avoid extra fees and higher rates in a relatively short time.

Unless you have a good reason to take a two-year fixed rate, such as needing to move or expecting to have to sell your home, brokers have suggested that five-year fixed rates might be a cheaper long-term bet.

A note on rates Rates can change on mortgages at short notice and sadly lenders do not always inform us when they alter them (especially if they raise rates rather than lower them). This can lead to occasions when the rates listed here are not available. If you ever spot this situation - or a good rate we have not listed - please email editor@thisismoney.co.uk with mortgage rates in the subject line and we will update the round-up asap.

Best tracker rate mortgages

Tracking a 0.10 per cent Base Rate may seem an odd decision when rates are likely to only go up - and you could fix for up to five years at a lower rate - however, there is one big advantage to a good lifetime tracker: flexibility.

A fixed-rate mortgage will almost inevitably carry early repayment charges, meaning you will be limited as to how much you can overpay, or face potentially thousands of pounds in fees if you opt to leave before the initial deal period is up.

You should be able to take a good fixed mortgage with you if you move, as most are portable, but there is no guarantee your new property will be eligible or you may even have a gap between ownership.

A good lifetime tracker has no early repayment charges, you can up sticks whenever you want and that suits some people.

Make sure you stress test yourself against a sharper rise in base rate than is forecast.

Lifetime trackers

Melton BS has a lifetime discounted variable rate at its SVR minus 3.00 per cent for the term, currently at 1.99 per cent with fees of £290 at 75 per cent loan-to-value

First Direct has a tracker at base plus 2.09 per cent for the term, currently at 2.19 per cent with fees of £490 at 60 per cent loan-to-value

Shorter trackers

Natwest has a two-year tracker at base plus 0.90 per cent with fees of £745 at 75 per cent loan-to-value

Leek BS has a two-year discounted variable rate at its SVR minus 4.20 per cent, currently at 0.99 per cent, with fees of £1,495 at 75 per cent loan-to-value

Watch out for discount rates, as these track a rate set by the lender rather than following the path of the Bank of England base rate.

Most lenders move their internal variable rate in line with the base rate, but they don't have to, meaning you could see your rate rise even if the base rate stays put.

Can you get a mortgage?

Getting a mortgage is tougher than it once was. You will need to get your finances in order and be prepared for the lengthier application process and in-depth affordability interviews getting a mortgage requires nowadays.

Lenders also apply different standards to what they will lend.

Weigh up the above, check the rates here and in our best buy mortgage tables, have a scout around what the best deals look like – and speak to a good independent broker.

There are a couple of things to look out for if you do decide to fix.

You need to check the bumper arrangement fees are worth paying – if you don't have a big mortgage you may be better off with a slightly higher rate and lower fee.

It's also wise to think carefully about whether you expect to move home soon. A good five-year fix should be portable, so you can take it with you.

But your new property will need to be assessed and you might need to borrow extra money, and so your lender could still say no. Getting out of a fixed rate typically requires a hefty hit to the pocket from early repayment charges.

Today's low rates may stick around, they may even inch a little lower, but they may also be swiftly axed.

If you think you'd kick yourself if you miss out on one, then set aside some time to consider what to do.

Choosing a mortgage - the essential quick guide

1. How big a deposit do I need?

To get the full choice of deals raising a decent deposit is still vital. The benchmark figure is 25 per cent, if you have this then you'll be getting close to the best rates, although for an absolute cheapest deal you're still likely to need 40 per cent.

However, a selection of better deals for smaller deposits is also now available.

2. Should I take a fixed rate?

Most borrowers consider the security of a fixed rate as worthwhile, whereas variable rate deals can be cheaper but leave you exposed to potential rate rises.

If you decide to take a fix you need to carefully consider how long for.

Two-year deals are cheap but only offer very short-term security and incur extra costs when you remortgage.

Five-year deals lock you in for longer and come with slightly higher rates but better security and no need to remortgage in a relatively short space of time.

3. Should I take a tracker rate?

Tracker rates are essentially a gamble. What looks like a bargain rate now, could soon get very expensive when interest rates rise.

Anyone considering a tracker needs to make sure they are not just storing up a problem for the future. If the tracker comes with an early redemption penalty that would make it expensive to jump ship, then make sure your finances could take a rise of at least 2 per cent to 3 per cent in interest rates.

For that reason we at This is Money like tracker deals that fit into one of these three categories: no early redemption penalties, a cap to how high the rate will go, or that let you jump ship for a fixed rate if rates rise.

4. Should I get off a standard variable rate?

Standard variable rates are what borrowers slip onto by default when they finish a fixed or tracker deal period.

They can typically be changed by lenders at any time - without the Bank of England moving rates, they may also rise or fall by more than any move in base rate.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If your car is due its MOT in the coming weeks, you’d be well advised to book it in sooner rather than later, experts have warned.

Motoring group have predicted a surge in demand for vehicle safety tests next month – which is being dubbed ‘Super September’ – after it was revealed that millions of car owners used the Government's Covid-19 MOT exemption at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.

Cars, motorcycles and light vans due an MOT between March 30 and July 31 last year were eligible for a six-month extension due to the nationwide lockdown - and 5.5 million drivers are estimated to have taken up the offer.

Experts are predicting a surge in demand for vehicle safety tests next month – which is being dubbed ‘Super September’

Those motorists who did use the six-month extension from 31 March last year would have deferred their car's annual check up to the six months from September 2020 – with the knock-on effect that high numbers of vehicles now need the annual test in the same month this year.

One in five (20 per cent) of 14,688 UK drivers surveyed by the AA said they took advantage of the extension, indicating that more than 5.5million cars had a delayed MOT.

The AA’s head of roads policy Jack Cousens said: ‘With more than 5.5million cars deferring an MOT it is crucial that they are tested to ensure they are safe to use.

'MOT centres are already feeling the strain and with “Super September” looming, savvy drivers can get ahead of the game. Don’t delay, book today.

‘Usually people leave booking their MOT to the last possible moment. Drivers won’t have that luxury this time.’

Vehicles must have an MOT on the third anniversary of their registration, and then every 12 months

Drivers can be fined up to £1,000 for using a vehicle without a valid MOT.

The test costs a maximum of £54.85 for an average car.

Vehicles must have an MOT on the third anniversary of their registration, and then every 12 months.

A number of parts such as lights, seatbelts, tyres and brakes are checked to ensure they meet legal standards.

Additional findings from the study suggest some drivers are entirely reliant on the annual roadworthiness check to ensure their cars are safe and fit to use.

Worryingly, the survey by the AA found that only three quarters (75 per cent) of motorists book their car in for a full service at least once a year, while another 19 per cent do service their cars but less frequently than this.

Some six per cent never put their car through a full service.

The data shows that drivers aged 18 to 24 and members of low income households are least likely to have their cars serviced, despite these groups typically owning older cars that are more likely to suffer major mechanical issues.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Shock hike to the price cap will see it increase by an average of £139 a year

Nine of the top 10 cheapest energy deals only available via an internet account

Struggling families could find their energy bills soar by more than £230 a year following a shock hike to the price cap.

The cap — which limits the amount suppliers can typically charge for a unit of electricity or gas — will increase by an average of £139 a year.

Yet millions of households will pay even more. Those in larger properties, or with higher usage, will see bills soar, and those in certain parts of the country can also expect to be hit harder.

Bills shock: The energy price cap - which limits the amount suppliers can typically charge for a unit of electricity or gas - will increase by an average of £139 a year

Money Mail has also found that the cheapest energy deals are typically reserved for those with internet or who live in specific areas. Experts have warned of power bill hikes for months after a record increase in energy prices.

In April the cap was increased by £96 a year to £1,138. But the latest rise — which takes the cap to £1,277 — is the largest increase since the cap was introduced in January 2019, and a 23 per cent increase since the start of this year.

Below, we unpick how stretched households are being hit even harder by the ever-rising cost of energy — and how you can save.

Families pushed to the brink

Regulator Ofgem sets the price cap twice a year. It affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who are on their supplier’s default deal.

This accounts for half of UK households, who have never switched provider or whose discount deal has expired. The cap dictates how much a supplier can charge for a unit of energy used, so those who use more will pay more.

Around four million prepayment meter customers will also be affected, paying an extra £153 as the average bill jumps to £1,309.

Households on fixed deals are not affected, but are still being hit by rising bills linked to the energy price surge.

In the last 11 weeks, prices of the cheapest fixed deals have gone up by £117, according to comparison site energyhelpline, and experts say they expect this to continue.

A family on a default deal living in a four-bed detached house can expect their combined gas and electricity bills to increase from £1,840 to £2,078 from October when the new price cap comes in, according to provider Octopus Energy.

This means they will need to find an extra £238 a year — £100 more than the price cap increase — and 13 per cent more than before. The same family in a three-bed terraced house could expect their energy to cost £151 more a year.

A single pensioner living in a two-bed property will see bills increase by £140 a year, whereas a young couple in a two-bed flat will pay £119 more.

Even those with low energy usage will have to pay £90 extra under the new price cap, whereas those with higher usage will see bills rise by £202.

Price hike: A family on a default deal living in a four-bed detached house will can expect their combined gas and electricity bills to increase from £1,840 to £2,078 from October

Cheapest deals online only

Nine of the top ten cheapest energy deals are available only to those with an internet account, according to energyhelpline.

And the only top 10 tariff available to those who are not online is £50 a year more expensive than the offer that costs least.

Utility Warehouse’s Double Gold variable tariff is £1,081 a year, based on average usage, and you don’t have to be online.

However, you must agree to have all your utilities provided by it and sign up to the supplier’s Gold Bundle, which also includes broadband, mobile and landline.

The two cheapest online-only deals are Ebico Living’s Standard April 2021 tariff and Utility Point’s Just Join Up, which cost £1,032 and £1,036 each year respectively – a saving of more than £240 compared to the new price cap for those who switch.

Tashema Jackson, from the comparison site energyhelpline.com, says: ‘Increasingly, the best deal to be found on a whole range of products and services is by shopping online and energy is no different.

‘However, for those who aren’t connected to the internet or who aren’t quite as internet-savvy, it can seem as if they are being left behind when it comes to finding the cheapest prices.’

She adds that those not online can call their existing supplier to ask to be put on their cheapest deal, or ring the call centre number of some of the biggest comparison sites for help in finding a better- value provider.

Daft meters: Smart meters, which monitor your energy usage in real time and send meter readings automatically, have been plagued with problems since their rollout in 2016

Postcode lottery

Hundreds of thousands of households will also be penalised because of where they live.

The charges are then passed to customers and the differences can be extreme.

Data from Octopus Energy suggests those living in South-West England will be charged the highest annual energy bills of £1,318 for electricity and gas once the new price cap is introduced.

This is £70 more than families in the East Midlands, who will pay £1,248 a year for their energy from October — the lowest prices in the UK.

Merseyside and North and South Wales also pay over the odds for energy and can expect annual bills to increase to £1,306 and £1,300 later this year.

At the other end of the scale, households in Yorkshire and the North-East of England will pay £1,253 and £1,252 a year respectively.

The annual bill for those in northern Scotland will be £1,279, whereas those in southern Scotland will pay £1,253.

How much you pay depends on a number of factors. These include how much energy firms sell in your area, how much power is generated locally and what the local distribution network, which supplies energy from the grid, charges providers for the service.

For example, some areas can get their energy supply a little cheaper than others because they have a more abundant supply of fossil fuels or renewable energy.

Smart meter warning

You may find that your energy provider will offer you a cheaper tariff if you agree to have a smart meter installed.

The devices, which monitor your energy usage and send meter readings, have been plagued with problems since 2016, many people complaining of glitches and faults when they switched provider.

The second generation meters, Smets2 devices, were meant to rectify this, however, many suppliers are still not installing these and continue to use original models. The rollout has also been slowed by the lockdowns.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Over half of customers visiting convenience stores prefer to pay for goods using cash

More than half of all customers visiting convenience stores prefer to pay for goods using cash, according to new research by payment firm PayPoint.

The findings support The Mail on Sunday's Keep Our Cash campaign that is fighting for the right to continue to have access to cash on the high street.

PayPoint collected the data from 28,000 shops where it offers a service. It also found preference for cash varies widely depending on location.

The most cash-friendly region is County Down in Northern Ireland, where 69 per cent of people prefer to pay with coins and banknotes rather than a contactless card.

The most cash averse county is Oxfordshire, where only 46 per cent of people say money is their favoured payment method.

Nick Wiles, chief executive of PayPoint, says: 'Despite the rise of digital payments in the pandemic, it remains clear cash is a firm favourite in a majority of communities. The most vulnerable need cash.'

A separate study by Natalie Ceeney, author of the independent Access To Cash review, has found eight million people rely on cash for their basic shopping and budgeting needs.

The former Financial Ombudsman boss has helped set up half a dozen pilot schemes, designed to test new ways in which cash can be accessed on the high street.

If successful, they could be rolled out nationwide.

Married At First Sight UK is back - and this series promises to be more sexy, shocking and scandalous than ever before.

Ahead of the series six launch, the 16 singletons who will be walking down the aisle have been revealed - with seven females and nine males making up the eight couples, meaning the show is set to welcome its first gay couple.

While the pairings are yet to be announced, the diverse line-up sees football influencer Amy, 34, on-call firefighter Luke, 36, and veterinary nurse Morag, 31, lead the contestants - who will be followed over 21 episodes on their quest for love.

One to watch: Meet the Married At First Sight UK contestants: A football influencer, Linford Christie's nephew and a party-mad veterinary nurse lead the line-up - with the show also set to welcome its first gay couple

The series has been revamped to follow the Australian format, and rather than legal marriages, the couples will make a lifelong commitment to one another at a glamorous ceremony, overseen by a wedding celebrant, that includes guests, bridal gowns, dancing, speeches and cake.

After the ceremony and celebrations are over, true love is well and truly put to the test, as they embark on a luxurious honeymoon, before moving in with each other and their fellow couples.

Relationships will be put under the microscope, by fellow brides and grooms at weekly dinner parties – as well as by the experts, at recurring commitment ceremonies, where couples choose whether they want to stay in or leave the process.

Here come the girls: (L-R) Amy, Alexis, Megan, Nikita, Marilyse, Tayah and Morag make up seven of the 16 singletons who will be walking down the aisle when season six of the show launches later in the year

All this will build to a dramatic series finale: glossy, high-stakes vow renewals, in which each couple must decide if they will recommit to their partner or go their separate ways.

No-nonsense Married at First Sight Australia expert Melanie Schilling and Sex and Relationship Therapist, Charlene Douglas will be joining returning star Paul C. Brunson (Celebs Go Dating) for this brand-new series.

Mel and Paul will be tasked with matching a group of singles hoping to find love when they meet for the first time at the altar, whilst Charlene works with the couples as they navigate their new relationships and get to know their partners on a more intimate level.

Here come the boys: (L-R) Franky, Daniel, Adam, Jordon, Ant, Matt, Joshua, Luke and Robert make up this year's male contestants, with two of the men set to form Married At First Sight UK's first gay couple

Ahead of the series airing, influencer Amy said: 'With Married At First Sight UK, either I'm going to find the love of my life or I'm going to learn a really big lesson from it, which might lead me to the love of my life.'

Amy was raised in Cornwall by her parents alongside her grandmother who championed her 10-year glamour modelling career.

With sports in her genes, she soon made it her main passion in life and now works as a sports presenter, using various platforms to discuss football and her favourite team, Chelsea FC.

Amy sees Married at First Sight UK as an opportunity to finally try and let down her guard. She wants to learn what love is and take off the veneer of sassiness that has protected her from letting another person in.

Amy and Luke: Amy said, With Married At First Sight UK, either I'm going to find the love of my life or I'm going to learn a really big lesson from it', while fireman Luke, 36, who has been described as the ' perfect gentleman'

Others who are looking to wed thanks to the show include care home manager and fireman Luke, 36, who has been described as the 'perfect gentleman'.

He said: 'I already have more in common with this person than I would do meeting them on dating apps or in the pub. Because they’ve done the same thing, they must be in a similar circumstance to me.'

Luke is struggling with self-esteem issues after his relationship crushed his confidence and he’s spent the last year rebuilding himself. Now he thinks he’s ready to move on at this perfect junction in his life with someone who’ll love him for him.

Morag and Megan: Veterinary Nurse Morag said, 'I want the experts to help because I've got high expectations of myself and what I want from my partner', while wellness coach Megan, 26, needed professional help due to her own 'terrible taste' in men

Veterinary Nurse Morag is hoping for some help from the show's experts, and explained: 'I want the experts to help because I've got high expectations of myself and what I want from my partner. I want them to help me open up and let someone in.'

She's considered the life and soul of the party and learned that from 'the best', her dad, with whom who she spent an unconventional upbringing between Essex and Ibiza.

Unapologetically confident and loud, a normal 9-5 was not for Morag, so a career change in her mid-twenties saw her chase her dreams of being a veterinary nurse in Australia.

In 2019, Morag returned to the UK when her dad fell ill and recently passed away. Now, she’s more determined than ever to find love and is looking for a man who is ready to embrace her big laugh.

She is looking for a man that wants to begin a committed relationship but doesn’t want to settle down; they must be adventurous, fun and spontaneous, and still love to party.

Marilyse and Matt: Personal trainer Marilyse, 37, would be 'disappointed' if she didn't find The One by the end of the show, while charity worker Matt, 39, is 'really excited' about potentially meeting someone he can start a family with

Wellness coach Megan, 26, admitted she needed professional help due to her own 'terrible taste' in men.

She explained: 'My dating history is horrendous, I have terrible taste. Of course, it is a good option to get someone to do it for me. It just felt like an opportunity I couldn’t miss. Each step of the way has felt more and more right.'

Megan sees herself as a constant entertainer and loves to sing, dance, and share her ‘good energy’ with everyone she meets.

With her dad passing away when she was only eight, she was faced with grief at a young age, but used her experience to chase down her dream job and she now helps young children with their mental health.

It’s important that her partner is kind and polite and she would love them to be creative, ambitious and confident. Humour is top of Megan’s list, it’s essential that he makes her laugh and can make other people laugh too; she wants him to be able to walk into a room and light it up.

Adam and Ant: Electrician Adam, 26, said 'I’m only going to take positives from it. Hopefully I’ll find the right one', Ant, 28, is very confident in his ability to influence situations and he believes he has a lot of sway on people

Personal trainer Marilyse, 37, would be 'disappointed' if she didn't find The One by the end of the show.

She said: 'I would love to go through to the experiment to the very end and still be with the guy.

'That is what I want to happen and what I expect to happen. I will be a bit disappointed if it doesn't happen, but we'll have to wait and see.'

The Yorkshire-born trainer describes herself as strong, switched on and very positive and needs an old-fashioned 'manly man' who is full of passion and energy otherwise she gets bored.

She wants to find her teammate in life who she can conquer the world with, but the mother-of-two said they’ve got to get her two sons’ approval first, who are keen for their mum to be with someone, but they have a lot of thoughts on who that should be.

The perfect guy for Marilyse would be a man who is strong minded and strong-willed. She is looking for her best friend and soul mate.

Daniel and Nikita: Salesman Daniel, 27, said the show 'will allow me to shift my pattern in terms of relationships', while Nikita, 26, mused, 'Ideally, we all want our Prince Charming who we are going to be with until the day we die'

Charity worker Matt, 39, is 'really excited' about potentially meeting someone he can start a family with.

He said: 'The reason I've come onto the show is because I'm really wanting to meet that special person that I can start building a life with and have a family. I'm really excited.'

After a messy break up, which left him feeling heart broken and needing to re-discover himself, Matt now feels like he’s ready and it’s time to find the one.

It’s not the first time he has had to rebuild himself. After his dad got diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2004, Matt quit his corporate career and focused his work in the cancer charity sector, which he loves.

With a big verve for life, he’s a highly outgoing person who, in his limited spare time, goes to choir practice and has even performed in a Take That tribute band.

Matt constantly gives a lot of himself to others, but admits he got lost in that and is now highly conscious that at his age he would like to have kids and settle down. Matt would like someone who wants the same things and somebody to grow old with.

Robert and Alexis: Robert, 26, is a fun-loving guy who’s desperate to share the limelight with his future partner while Alexis, 28, is described as 'bold, lively and an incredibly strong'

Electrician Adam, 26, had a great mindset ahead of the show, saying he was 'forcing myself into the situation where I have to be with someone – I’m only going to take positives from it. Hopefully I’ll find the right one.'

The Doncaster-born star said he has never had time to find himself a proper partner, dividing the majority of his time between work and the gym.

He is super competitive and, for the right person, he’d not only make time for them, but would work hard at the marriage to ensure it’s successful.

With a positive outlook on life, Adam is super relaxed when it comes to his preferences. His ideal match would have nice eyes and be naturally pretty. They must be ambitious, spontaneous and positive.

Adam loves pushing himself, being challenged and trying new things, so wants to see his potential partner challenge him in a new way.

Business development worker Ant, 28, has braced himself for whatever the outcome, saying: 'The best that could happen is that the experts find me a match and it works out perfectly and find our happily ever after. The worst case is it doesn’t work out and I make some new friends and I learn a bit about myself as a person.'

The social butterfly is very confident in his ability to influence situations and he believes he has a lot of sway on people.

He’s learnt the hard way to not take life for granted and wants to get better at being honest and opening up emotionally.

Franky and Tayah: Franky, 47, said 'all my life has been about challenges. I don’t like to do the normal,' while estate agent Tayah, 25, has starting a family high on her list of priorities as she 'always wanted to be a young mum'

The perfect person for Ant would be someone who is a funny, bubbly, ambitious person and up for exploring and adventure.

Salesman Daniel, 27, said of the opportunity: 'Married At First Sight UK is a big experience and quite nerve racking in many ways, however it is something that will allow me to shift my pattern in terms of relationships and it is a blessing to have the professional and scientific advice that will help me'.

Daniel wants to share his passion for hiking, meditation, cold water swims and vegetarian living with others. Of course, Dan doesn’t want to do this alone; he is looking for someone open minded, who shares his passion for the outdoors.

Jordon and Josh: Personal trainer Jordon, 27, said he's misunderstood by people who don't realise he is a 'gentle and very positive soul', while Josh 26, said 'I think marriage has always been on my cards'

Also working in sales is Nikita, 26, who mused: 'Ideally, we all want our Prince Charming who we are going to be with until the day we die. I just think that if I meet someone who blows me away and we’re on the same wavelength and have proper banter it will be great.'

Described as emotionally charged, stubborn and wearing her heart firmly on her sleeve, Nikita finds that people tend to misjudge her.

Nikita has already planned her wedding and picked her children’s names and believes that because she has fallen in love twice already, that this is her third time lucky.

Business protection specialist Robert, 26, goes by the nickname 'Big Bob' owing to his big personality. He said: 'I want to have fun all the time, so I want someone who wants to go out and do things. Someone who is on my wavelength with how I look at life.'

Robert is a fun-loving guy who’s desperate to share the limelight with his future partner and is after someone with a big personality who loves to have a laugh.

Model Alexis, 28, is described as 'bold, lively and an incredibly strong', and said: 'I’ve applied to this to find the good guy, to find someone genuine and someone who wants commitment.

Guess who's back: Married at First Sight Australia expert Mel Schilling has over 20 years of experience as a qualified specialist in human behavioural performance and purpose, and is now joining the UK version of the show

'I give my all and I’m very supportive. I’m looking for someone on my wavelength and I want someone who is going to take the reins a little bit.'

Over the last two years, she took a break from boyfriends and realised she needed to work on herself and she’s now ready to make the space and time for what she hopes will be the last man in her life.

Alexis wants an ambitious, well-educated, well spoken, family orientated husband. He needs to be understanding, compassionate and affectionate. He must know how to communicate and be in touch with his emotions. But mostly she wants a best friend kind of relationship as she’s never had that before.

Former army man Franky, 47, said: 'All my life has been about challenges. I don’t like to do the normal. If anything is normal then I find it boring. I’m not captured unless I’m entertained and challenged - and Married At First Sight UK is a bloody big challenge.'

The strength and conditioning coach fought for his country for 15 years and lived as an expat for 15 years in Dubai, and now wants to find his soulmate who’ll be happy to join him overseas.

Estate agent Tayah, 25, has starting a family high on her list of priorities, saying: 'My happy ever after would be that I’ve always wanted to get married and wanted kids. I’ve always wanted to be a young mum.

'My end goal is to have that family and have that family unit. So that would be an ideal situation to come from this.'

Tayah wants to find someone who takes care of themselves and will look good standing next to her. She likes a confident guy, someone who knows themselves and who has 'a bit of something' about them.

Experts: Last year, for the U.K.’s fifth series Paul Carrick Brunson had a 75% success rate, with three of the four matched couples still together, and he will return alongside Charlene Douglas, an experienced Sex and Relationship Therapist

Personal trainer Jordon, 27, said he's misunderstood by people who don't realise he is a 'gentle and very positive soul.'

He said: 'My happily ever after would be to learn stuff about myself that I didn’t know before. I want to become stronger as a person and to obviously walk away with a partner and with some new friends.'

Cardiff-born Jordon was raised on the traditions and values of his grandmother, and also strongly believes in God and spirituality. He would love to bring a partner home to meet his grandmother, but mostly he’s looking for someone with whom he can raise the family he never had.

Completing this year's line-up is Josh, 26, who works in insurance, said: 'I think marriage has always been on my cards, but I could never see myself getting on one knee, so this is a fast track!

'Sometimes I need to be kicked into the deep end so for me this is the start of a new chapter.'

He describes himself as having ambition, competitiveness and drive which have all made him succeed at anything he turns his hand to; from his sporting ambitions, to working hard as a teenager when his dad passed away.

He’d like somebody who can understand him, but also put him in his place sometimes. He’d like someone with a good balance between social and work life, who works hard, likes fitness, but also doesn’t take themselves too seriously.

While an official launch date is yet to be announced, Married At First Sight UK is coming to E4 very soon.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Figures from the Current Account Switch Service have found more than 7million people have now switched their bank account since 2013.

But if that sounds cause for celebration, it's just 1million more people than the number who switched energy supplier in 2020 alone.

Indeed, the people who regularly switch bank accounts are a rarity, and are usually the ones happy to spend a few hours buried in paperwork in return for a cash switching bonus or other perks.

But despite that paperwork, switching is easy, with CASS pledging to switch your account and any direct debits over in seven days.

Find a more rewarding deal: Some accounts promise cashback, interest and freebies

The competition for current account customers resumed again after the end of the first coronavirus lockdown, with banks bringing back switching bonuses.

Many of these have dried up again, however, while continued low interest rates and pressure on margins mean current account perks are not as generous as they used to be.

Nonetheless, if you're unhappy with your current bank or spot a better deal elsewhere, that's no reason not to switch. You can find our picks of the best accounts below.

Interest: Nationwide pays 2% on balances of up to £1,500

1. Best account for in-credit interest: Nationwide

Current account in-credit interest is not what it used to be.

Last April Nationwide Building Society's FlexDirect account, which had helped Britain's biggest mutual snap up more than half a million net switchers since 2013, saw its rate fall from 5 per cent to 2 per cent.

But at a time of low rates this is still the best interest-paying account out there. The rate is paid on balances of up to £1,500, and isn't bad considering top easy-access deals pay just 0.5 per cent.

Virgin Money's account pays 2.02 per cent interest, but only on balances up to £1,000.

For the Nationwide account, holders must pay in a minimum monthly income of £1,000. On the last day of every month Nationwide will calculate the interest earned each day and then pay this interest on the first day of the next month.

Holders are also eligible for a 0 per cent overdraft for the first 12 months, but after that they pay a whopping 39.9 per cent.

Watch out

If your income drops and you can't pay in £1,000, you won't receive any interest that month.

The 2 per cent interest deal ends after a year, when it drops to just 0.25 per cent. So it may be worth looking elsewhere after the 12 months for a better return on your money.

You get an interest-free arranged overdraft for that 12 months, but after that overdraft fees are hefty.

Recent changes to its overdrafts mean customers will now pay a flat rate of 39.9 per cent interest when overdrawn, this will be costly for those who regularly stray into the red.

George Nixon's verdict

Accounts that are good for both in-credit and overdrawn customers are few and far between so this could be a good bet for those who have smaller balances - but can afford to pay in £1,000 each month, while the account still offers those benefits.

HSBC is offering customers £125 to switch

2. Best account for cash: HSBC

Three-figure switching bonuses disappeared for much of 2020 but luckily for those seeking cash bribes HSBC has brought at least one back.

What about overdraft rates? Previously, This is Money offered a guide to the best bank accounts for overdraft borrowers. Unfortunately, that guide is somewhat moot after almost all of Britain's biggest banks hiked the cost of borrowing to nearly 40 per cent APR, more than double the cost of the average credit card. According to the latest figures from the Bank of England, average overdraft rates stood at 20 per cent in December. This was in response to a crackdown on the cost of unarranged borrowing and the transparency of overdraft rates, which were often priced using daily fees which quickly added up. Sadly, this means there isn't a great deal of savings to be made, with almost all banks charging upwards of 35 per cent and HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, Nationwide Building Society and Santander all charging 39.9 per cent. Instead, the best bet is to avoid being charged these fees in the first place, by using a fee-free buffer if it's available. The best buffer is offered by HSBC offshoot First Direct, and offers £250 fee-free.

It is paying £125 for people to switch to its Advance account, which ironically comes months after the bank suggested it might charging people to bank with it in some countries, although not the UK.

Customers must open an account, switch to it through the official switching service and ensure two direct debits or standing orders are moved as part of the switch.

They must also pay in £1,750 a month or £10,500 within six months to be eligible for the account.

Watch out

In order to be eligible for the account, customers must be eligible for a £1,000 overdraft. However, outside of a £25 fee-free buffer, that overdraft could get quite costly, as HSBC, like other major high street banks, charges 39.9 per cent on borrowing.

That is close to twice the rate of the average credit card.

The account also pays no interest, however it does offer a linked regular saver allowing £25 - £250 to be saved each month paying 1 per cent interest.

George Nixon's verdict

The cash switching bonus is the best around, so on that basis there's very little competition at the moment.

However between the near-40 per cent overdraft rate and the floated proposal to charge for banking services, it would remain to be seen how quickly that £125 welcome bonus was eaten up, regardless of whether a customer was in-credit or in the red.

But in the meantime, it might be worth signing up, claiming the bonus, and switching away - something thousands of HSBC customers have done in recent months.

Lloyds Bank: offers the best current account for interest on large balances

3. Best account for interest on a large balance: Lloyds

With multiple cuts to Santander's 123 account over the last 12 months, and the account paying just 0.3 per cent on up to £20,000 since April 2021, Lloyds Bank's Club Lloyds account is now probably a better offer, although the 123 account still offers up to 3 per cent cashback.

Club Lloyds pays 0.6 per cent on interest on balances of up to £3,999, while those with sums of between £4,000 and £5,000 will earn 1.5 per cent on that balance. This works out at around £39 interest if customers kept in the full £5,000 for a year, an interest rate of around 0.8 per cent.

Overdrafts are charged at 29.9 per cent after a £50 interest-free buffer. There is no monthly fee if you pay in £1,500 a month, otherwise it charges £3.

George Nixon's verdict

Cuts to current account interest mean the blended rate of around 0.8 per cent you can get from Club Lloyds on £5,000 is the best rate you can get on balances above £1,500, while the three-figure switch bonus is the joint-best around.

The rate itself is slightly better than the best easy-access rate around at the moment, meaning you'd only earn a little less if you wanted to stash it elsewhere. But if you have more than £5,000 burning a hole in your pocket, you should earn a slightly worse rate with another savings bank elsewhere.

4. Best 'new kid on the block': Starling Bank

Winner of 'best British bank' at the British Bank Awards three years in a row and gaining the second-highest number of net accounts through the switching service in the first nine months of 2020, digital challenger bank Starling is increasingly a force to be reckoned with.

Originally a smartphone-only bank with an offering aimed largely at holidaymakers, the challenger, launched in 2016, has increasingly grown into a legitimate, even potentially profitable, challenger to Britain's biggest banks.

Starling: The multiple award-winning smartphone challenger bank

Its current account can be downloaded through a smartphone app and can now also be managed online, and pays 0.05 per cent interest on up to £85,000.

It offers instant spending notifications, compartmentalises spending into categories and lets accountholders create dedicated 'spaces' for their savings.

Plus, it allows customers to use their card overseas with no fees and make unlimited ATM withdrawals, again, without fees.

Watch out

Starling doesn't have any branches, which might cause an issue for some customers who want face-to-face banking, but customers can pay in cheques at 11,500 Post Office branches or using the app.

Like other banks, it also charges a potentially steep overdraft rate of up to 35 per cent on overdrafts, depending on customers' credit scores, although this can be as low as 15 per cent.

George Nixon's verdict

Starling gaining close to 40,000 accounts in the middle of a pandemic without offering customers any sweeteners suggests it must be doing something right, and the bank's interface and the way in which it categorises transactions has been praised by customers and awards judges alike as intuitive and easy to use.

Some Britons may not be ready to fully embrace digital banking but with fee-free overseas spending and ATM withdrawals, perhaps they should consider trying it for their holiday spending, if and when holidays are once again allowed, and go from there.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If your car is due its MOT in the coming weeks, you’d be well advised to book it in sooner rather than later, experts have warned.

Motoring group have predicted a surge in demand for vehicle safety tests next month – which is being dubbed ‘Super September’ – after it was revealed that millions of car owners used the Government's Covid-19 MOT exemption at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.

Cars, motorcycles and light vans due an MOT between March 30 and July 31 last year were eligible for a six-month extension due to the nationwide lockdown - and 5.5 million drivers are estimated to have taken up the offer.

Experts are predicting a surge in demand for vehicle safety tests next month – which is being dubbed ‘Super September’

Those motorists who did use the six-month extension from 31 March last year would have deferred their car's annual check up to the six months from September 2020 – with the knock-on effect that high numbers of vehicles now need the annual test in the same month this year.

One in five (20 per cent) of 14,688 UK drivers surveyed by the AA said they took advantage of the extension, indicating that more than 5.5million cars had a delayed MOT.

The AA’s head of roads policy Jack Cousens said: ‘With more than 5.5million cars deferring an MOT it is crucial that they are tested to ensure they are safe to use.

'MOT centres are already feeling the strain and with “Super September” looming, savvy drivers can get ahead of the game. Don’t delay, book today.

‘Usually people leave booking their MOT to the last possible moment. Drivers won’t have that luxury this time.’

Vehicles must have an MOT on the third anniversary of their registration, and then every 12 months

Drivers can be fined up to £1,000 for using a vehicle without a valid MOT.

The test costs a maximum of £54.85 for an average car.

Vehicles must have an MOT on the third anniversary of their registration, and then every 12 months.

A number of parts such as lights, seatbelts, tyres and brakes are checked to ensure they meet legal standards.

Additional findings from the study suggest some drivers are entirely reliant on the annual roadworthiness check to ensure their cars are safe and fit to use.

Worryingly, the survey by the AA found that only three quarters (75 per cent) of motorists book their car in for a full service at least once a year, while another 19 per cent do service their cars but less frequently than this.

Some six per cent never put their car through a full service.

The data shows that drivers aged 18 to 24 and members of low income households are least likely to have their cars serviced, despite these groups typically owning older cars that are more likely to suffer major mechanical issues.

Nine of the top 10 cheapest energy deals only available via an internet account

Struggling families could find their energy bills soar by more than £230 a year following a shock hike to the price cap.

The cap — which limits the amount suppliers can typically charge for a unit of electricity or gas — will increase by an average of £139 a year.

Yet millions of households will pay even more. Those in larger properties, or with higher usage, will see bills soar, and those in certain parts of the country can also expect to be hit harder.

Bills shock: The energy price cap - which limits the amount suppliers can typically charge for a unit of electricity or gas - will increase by an average of £139 a year

Money Mail has also found that the cheapest energy deals are typically reserved for those with internet or who live in specific areas. Experts have warned of power bill hikes for months after a record increase in energy prices.

In April the cap was increased by £96 a year to £1,138. But the latest rise — which takes the cap to £1,277 — is the largest increase since the cap was introduced in January 2019, and a 23 per cent increase since the start of this year.

Below, we unpick how stretched households are being hit even harder by the ever-rising cost of energy — and how you can save.

Families pushed to the brink

Regulator Ofgem sets the price cap twice a year. It affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who are on their supplier’s default deal.

This accounts for half of UK households, who have never switched provider or whose discount deal has expired. The cap dictates how much a supplier can charge for a unit of energy used, so those who use more will pay more.

Around four million prepayment meter customers will also be affected, paying an extra £153 as the average bill jumps to £1,309.

Households on fixed deals are not affected, but are still being hit by rising bills linked to the energy price surge.

In the last 11 weeks, prices of the cheapest fixed deals have gone up by £117, according to comparison site energyhelpline, and experts say they expect this to continue.

A family on a default deal living in a four-bed detached house can expect their combined gas and electricity bills to increase from £1,840 to £2,078 from October when the new price cap comes in, according to provider Octopus Energy.

This means they will need to find an extra £238 a year — £100 more than the price cap increase — and 13 per cent more than before. The same family in a three-bed terraced house could expect their energy to cost £151 more a year.

A single pensioner living in a two-bed property will see bills increase by £140 a year, whereas a young couple in a two-bed flat will pay £119 more.

Even those with low energy usage will have to pay £90 extra under the new price cap, whereas those with higher usage will see bills rise by £202.

Price hike: A family on a default deal living in a four-bed detached house will can expect their combined gas and electricity bills to increase from £1,840 to £2,078 from October

Cheapest deals online only

Nine of the top ten cheapest energy deals are available only to those with an internet account, according to energyhelpline.

And the only top 10 tariff available to those who are not online is £50 a year more expensive than the offer that costs least.

Utility Warehouse’s Double Gold variable tariff is £1,081 a year, based on average usage, and you don’t have to be online.

However, you must agree to have all your utilities provided by it and sign up to the supplier’s Gold Bundle, which also includes broadband, mobile and landline.

The two cheapest online-only deals are Ebico Living’s Standard April 2021 tariff and Utility Point’s Just Join Up, which cost £1,032 and £1,036 each year respectively – a saving of more than £240 compared to the new price cap for those who switch.

Tashema Jackson, from the comparison site energyhelpline.com, says: ‘Increasingly, the best deal to be found on a whole range of products and services is by shopping online and energy is no different.

‘However, for those who aren’t connected to the internet or who aren’t quite as internet-savvy, it can seem as if they are being left behind when it comes to finding the cheapest prices.’

She adds that those not online can call their existing supplier to ask to be put on their cheapest deal, or ring the call centre number of some of the biggest comparison sites for help in finding a better- value provider.

Daft meters: Smart meters, which monitor your energy usage in real time and send meter readings automatically, have been plagued with problems since their rollout in 2016

Postcode lottery

Hundreds of thousands of households will also be penalised because of where they live.

The charges are then passed to customers and the differences can be extreme.

Data from Octopus Energy suggests those living in South-West England will be charged the highest annual energy bills of £1,318 for electricity and gas once the new price cap is introduced.

This is £70 more than families in the East Midlands, who will pay £1,248 a year for their energy from October — the lowest prices in the UK.

Merseyside and North and South Wales also pay over the odds for energy and can expect annual bills to increase to £1,306 and £1,300 later this year.

At the other end of the scale, households in Yorkshire and the North-East of England will pay £1,253 and £1,252 a year respectively.

The annual bill for those in northern Scotland will be £1,279, whereas those in southern Scotland will pay £1,253.

How much you pay depends on a number of factors. These include how much energy firms sell in your area, how much power is generated locally and what the local distribution network, which supplies energy from the grid, charges providers for the service.

For example, some areas can get their energy supply a little cheaper than others because they have a more abundant supply of fossil fuels or renewable energy.

Smart meter warning

You may find that your energy provider will offer you a cheaper tariff if you agree to have a smart meter installed.

The devices, which monitor your energy usage and send meter readings, have been plagued with problems since 2016, many people complaining of glitches and faults when they switched provider.

The second generation meters, Smets2 devices, were meant to rectify this, however, many suppliers are still not installing these and continue to use original models. The rollout has also been slowed by the lockdowns.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@With Olympics mania set to reach fever pitch in the coming weeks with the Tokyo games starting, it could be time to check those piggy banks for rare coins.

In the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics, The Royal Mint launched a range of 50p coins to celebrate the diverse events of the games - from archery to wrestling.

They became a favourite among collectors as a wave of enthusiasm swept across the country during the games in the capital.

The Royal Mint introduced 29 of them featuring different sports to celebrate the London Olympics and Paralympics in 2012.

The Royal Mint is reminding the public to look out for the rare Olympic 50p’s that were released into circulation back in 2012.

Some are now being classed as the rarest 50p coins in circulation, with reports of the circulating coins selling for many times more than their face value, due to their collectability and appeal.

Rebecca Morgan, director of collector services at Royal Mint, said: 'Coin collecting remains a popular hobby in the UK, and it's exciting to find special designs in your change.'

She adds: 'We issued millions of coins in 2011 to celebrate the Olympics and Paralympics being in Britain in 2012, and as the event returns we expect more people will check their change to try and find one.

'Many people lucky enough to find an Olympic 50p in their change will add it to their collection, or retain it as a keepsake.

The football 50p coin still sells on the secondary market for around £20 according to Change Checker

'This can make them hard to find, and collectors might look on the secondary market to complete their set.'

The rarest of the coins is the football 50p coin which has a mintage of only 1,125,500 with the wrestling 50p coin coming a close second with 1,129,500 in mintage.

The football 50p, which features the offside rule in the form of a diagram, still sells on the secondary market for around £20 according to Change Checker's analysis – 40 times' its face value.

A quick check on eBay and you'll find plenty of examples of the coin selling for closer to £15 – a good return.

Rachel Hooper, author at Change Checker said: 'It's definitely the rarest one to look out for and tops our chart as having the smallest mintage figures, which means it is even harder to find than the others.

'Although the Football 50p narrowly holds the title of the rarest sport in the series, there were still over one million of those struck for circulation.

'To hold the honourable title as "rare", we must look beyond the official Royal Mint circulation figures.'

This is Money therefore thought it would take a closer look at the absolute scarcest Olympic themed 50p coins ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.

The withdrawn aquatics 'error' Olympic 50p

Although there are close to 2.18million Aquatics 50p coins in circulation, placing the coin towards the bottom of Change Checker's scarcity index, there was an early adaptation which is incredibly rare.

The first aquatics 50p coin released for the London 2012 Olympics depicted a swimmer with lines across the face being covered in water.

However, this was modified very early on removing the waves passing over the swimmer's face - but there are still a few of the original coins likely in circulation.

'Although the exact quantity of the original aquatics design remains a mystery, we know it's not unusual for these special coins to exchange hands for close to £1,000,' said Hooper.

The aquatics 50p design was modified to make the swimmer more visible.

According to the website UK Coins, only 600 of these Olympic 50p swimmer coins were ever issued before the design was changed.

But Philip Mussell, of Coin News magazine, believes there are likely to have been a few thousand minted.

'They are not proof coins, they are uncirculated coins - they would have been made by a much larger machine and therefore, they would not have set up a large machine just to produce 600,' said Mussell.

'But I can confidently suggest that there are far fewer of these coins than there are collectors who want one.'

As for the price, Musson believes that you should typically expect to pay upwards of £750 for one of these coins.

The 2009 athletics Olympic 50p

In 2009, former BBC television show Blue Peter ran a competition to design an Olympic coin some three years ahead of the event held in London.

The winner, Florence Jackson then aged nine, became the youngest person to design a coin for circulation in the UK.

At the time, it could then be snapped up for £1.99 via the Royal Mint website.

However, since it was the first Olympics coin to be minted, according to Mussell, and due to its extreme rarity with only 19,751 minted, the price you are likely to pay now would be closer to £100.

The 2009 dated Athletics coin is the only Olympic 50p without a 2011 mintage date.

'In the world of numismatics these 50p coins are extremely rare,' said Mussell.

'Anything with a mintage under 100,000 is very rare and anything that is rare is going to be worth more money.

'The circulated athletics 50p minted in advance of the games had a mintage of 2,224,000.

'The earlier 2009 version is the one that everybody wants because it was the first one and there are fewer than 20,000 of them.

'Every collector wants one of everything and because this has a different date, people want it alongside the later minted athletics 50p.'

Is now a good time to sell?

With an estimated 75 per cent of the Olympic 50ps having been removed from circulation by collectors, according to Change Checker, the arrival of this year's long-awaited games might spark another nationwide coin hunt as everyone rushes to compete given a boost in interest in the Olympics.

If there is an upsurge in demand, there may be some who argue that now might be a good time to sell if you're looking to cash in your chips.

'There may well be more people collecting them at the moment and looking for them so it's perhaps possible prices on eBay will creep up slightly,' said Mussell.

'But the Olympic 50ps circulated are never going to be worth a lot of money because barring the two extremely rare ones, the rest were all minted in their millions.

'My suggestion is if you're still enjoying having them, keep hold of them.'

What's the advice for buyers?

Change Checker's scarcity index can provide you with an indication of how sought after your coin might be.

Using eBay's sold listings you will be able to get an indication of the actual price a coin is selling for on the open market, not just the prices sellers are listing them for - remember, an item is only worth what someone is willing to pay.

Mussell said: 'My first bit of advice is to shop around - the prices on eBay range from ridiculous to sensible.

'My second bit of advice is only ever buy because you want that particular coin, not because you want to sell it on and make a profit in the future.'

Morgan added: 'We want to ensure collectors pay a fair price for coins, and there are several key factors you should consider before committing to a price.

'This can include the condition of the coin, its design, mintage figure and what metal it's made of.

'We always recommend doing some research first, and there are a lot of useful resources on The Royal Mint's website.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It comes as a decision on whether boosters are needed is yet to be announced

One shot of a Covid jab and flu vaccine would save time and be more convenient

Dr Matthew Duchars, head of the VMIC, said 'it will save a lot of time and it would be a lot more convenient to just give one shot' for Covid and flu jabs

Covid and flu vaccines could eventually be mixed into one injection to save time and make future booster programmes more convenient, it was claimed today.

Dr Matthew Duchars, chief executive officer of the Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), claimed the facility in Oxford is looking into whether a single jab could be given to protect people against the virus and the flu.

Minister have not yet confirmed booster jabs will be given this autumn, with No10 waiting on advice from its expert panel before pressing ahead with plans.

But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said last week that the UK 'will be able to start the booster programme' from next month, if the Government is given the green light.

Up to 32million over-50s could be invited for top-up jabs, which may be dished out at the same time as the annual flu vaccine.

Whitehall sources said the plan this autumn is to administer Covid and flu jabs at the same time in different arms.

The vaccine-making centre had received around £215million in Government funding by March and is expected to produce 70million doses in as little as four months once up and running

What's the plan for Covid boosters? The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the Government on the vaccine roll out, set out interim advice in June for Covid boosters. It said any potential third dose programme should be offered in two stages from September, starting with those most at risk. This would include people in care homes, over-70s, frontline health workers and vulnerable adults. In a second stage, the boosters should be given to over-50s, over-16s who are at risk from the flu or Covid and those living with immunosuppressed individuals. The scientists said their final advice 'may change substantially' and will depend on emerging data, including on how long immunity lasts from two jabs. The groups identified by the JCVI are strongly advised to get a flu jab and Government sources have said the plan is to administer both injections at the same time in different arms. Sources revealed the injections will be dished out as up to 2,000 pharmacies, with the goal of administering 2.5million doses per week. Advertisement

But Dr Duchars told the Telegraph that the VMIC was looking at combining the two for future roll-outs.

He said: 'It will save a lot of time and it would be a lot more convenient to just give one shot, so it is something that we and vaccine developers and producers will be looking at.

'Let's say we do need to give a seasonal vaccine, and people need one shot for flu, and one shot for Covid and another for something else.

'If you can put them all into one, then that's obviously preferable.'

The Oxford-based VMIC was announced in 2018 as the UK's first ever vaccine-making hub and was due to open in 2022.

The Government said at the time it would invest £66million in the centre, but it had been granted £215million in funding by March and was fast-tracked to help in the fight against Covid.

It was founded by the University of Oxford, Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Once up and running, the VMCI will churn out 70million doses in as little as four months — nearly 600,000 doses a day.

Discussing the centre's capacity, Dr Duchars said: 'Our target is reasonable. I feel confident we can do that.

'Can we do it faster? Possibly. Hopefully. We'll absolutely be working on trying to do that.'

But the Government does not need to use the centre until 2022 because it has already secured enough vaccines for the rest of the year.

No10 has already bought 60million doses of Pfizer's jab to use this autumn.

And Whitehall insiders say that ministers have already secured a deal for an extra 35million doses of Pfizer's vaccine for next winter.

Dr Duchars added: 'In our discussions, their plan is to use VMIC for the revaccination campaign in 2022. That's what we've refocused our efforts and attention on.'

It comes as Mr Javid said last week that when the Government receives the JCVI's advice 'we will be able to start the booster programme', signalling that the Government expects the plans to be approved.

The NHS has been preparing for the roll-out, which the Health Secretary said is expected to begin in early September.

The JCVI said in June that any potential booster programme should be offered in two stages from September, starting with those most at risk.

This would include people in care homes, over-70s, frontline health workers and vulnerable adults.

But Government sources said earlier this month that the doses will be offered to over-50s, immunosuppressed people and NHS and care home staff from September 6 — equating to 32million Brits.

The source revealed the injections will be dished out as up to 2,000 pharmacies, with the goal of administering 2.5million doses per week.

It comes as a Government source revealed to the Mail on Sunday that Brits eligible for boosters may not be considered fully-jabbed it they do not come forward for a third dose.

The source told the newspaper: 'The assumption is that you will be required to have the most up-to-date health passport.

'So if the advice is to have a booster six months after your second jab, then that is what you'll need.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tesco Bank has announced it will close its current account operation from November in a move that wil leave 213,000 customers searching for a new home for their cash.

Just the latest supermarket to pull out of the current account market, Tesco's banking arm said that of those 213,000 customers, only 12 per cent use their it as a primary account.

That means nearly nine in 10 accounts have limited activity or are being used for other purposes, such as a savings pot. That means around 26,000 customers will be looking for a new primary current account.

Axed: The supermarket giant is exiting the current account market

The options are to switch using the seven-day service or transfer money to a Tesco Bank savings account.

It also says those hit can register for Tesco Clubcard Pay, a new product currently in test with a panel of shoppers and colleagues.

Meanwhile, those who are in an overdraft could be pushed to use one of its credit cards to clear the balance.

The current account was closed to new applicants in December 2019, suggesting the writing was on the wall nearly two years go.

They can be expensive for banks to run, especially if customers aren't actively using it and being cross-sold other products on the back of it.

Tesco Bank says customers will receive letters in the next two weeks outlining the options.

Earlier this year, M&S Bank made a similar move to cull current accounts as it appears supermarket challengers have failed to attract enough customers.

Customers who choose not to switch to a new current account have been warned they will need to move any regular incoming or outgoing payments to a different account, and to make sure their account has a balance of £0, by Tuesday 30 November 2021.

The bank as a whole has more than 5million customers across a range of banking and insurance products.

It says the closure supports its strategy of focusing on products and services that best meet the needs of its shoppers.

Gerry Mallon, chief executive of Tesco Bank, said: 'With so few of our current Account customers using it as their primary account we want to support them to find a suitable alternative dependent on their circumstances.

'We will pay particular attention to supporting any vulnerable customers and those in need of financial assistance.

'Customers who have been using our Current Account as a savings pot may be better suited to one of our tailored savings products.

'And shoppers who are looking for a payment option which allows them to continue collecting Clubcard points in and out of Tesco may want to consider Tesco Clubcard Pay or a Tesco Bank credit card.'

Clubcard Pay, it says, is an account which comes with a debit card and is designed to help shoppers pay, save and collect Clubcard points.

It adds that it will allowing shoppers to upload and ringfence their grocery spend from any UK current account into their Clubcard Pay account through the Tesco Bank mobile banking app.

Customers will collect Clubcard points on most of their shopping, both in and out of Tesco.

It comes with a round-up savings account, which lets customers build a savings pot by rounding up their spending to the nearest £1.

Where next?

Figures from the Current Account Switch Service show more than 7million people have now switched their bank account since 2013.

But if that sounds cause for celebration, it's just 1million more people than the number who switched energy supplier in 2020 alone.

Indeed, the people who regularly switch bank accounts are a rarity, and are usually the ones happy to spend a few hours buried in paperwork in return for a cash switching bonus or other perks.

But despite that paperwork, switching is easy, with CASS pledging to switch your account and any direct debits over in seven days.

There is currently £4,804.09 in the account and we are absolutely desperate for the money, as we have no funding for our Christmas stock.

Amazon take fees off us on a regular basis, and we have the cost of the cards and postage to pay for, so we have had to take out a large overdraft facility. Why have we not been verified yet? B.K., via email

A business owner has still not been verified by Amazon meaning she cannot access her funds

Grace Gausden, consumer expert at This is Money, replies: You may make pop-up cards but you wanted to pop off at Amazon after the firm held on to your money for months on end – with no indication of when you would have access to it.

During the pandemic, you decided to start selling your 3D greeting cards on Amazon, as you could no longer sell them on your usual market stall.

Fortunately, the business has been a success and you have received hundreds of orders.

However, despite racking up nearly £5,000 in sales since December, you have been unable to take the money out of your account as Amazon has not verified you – even though you requested when launching your business.

You went through the extensive verification process at the time, providing passport details, tax details and bank information.

You also had to complete an interview on Zoom with an Amazon employee, whose job it was to start the initial process, providing her with documentation such as driving licences and explaining your business model.

Every time you have tried to contact Amazon, you have been given a generic response saying someone would come back to you but they never have.

You said they will not give an estimation of the time scale involved which means you are left not knowing how to proceed - even though you were told months ago it would be roughly three weeks.

As you are still paying Amazon's fees as well as paying for suppliers, you are now finding yourself in a difficult financial situation, accruing debts of around £600 a month just to keep the account going.

The costs, according to Amazon's website, are £25 excluding VAT each month for professional businesses, selling hundreds of items each month, as well as a referral fee for each item sold.

This usually ranges from 8 per cent to 15 per cent with a minimum referral fee of £0.25 per item.

As such, the amount you are sending to Amazon is quite hefty each month - without getting your money back rightfully in return.

Amazon are taking months to verify the accounts of businesses looking to sell on the site

This is especially worrying as you know that Christmas will be a busy time and you are looking to take advantage of being able to sell on Amazon, however, you are worried about paying for your stock.

I contacted the site to ask why it was taking so long for you to be verified, how long it should usually take and when you could expect to have access to your funds.

Luckily, it acted quickly and has now verified your account, releasing your funds immediately.

An Amazon spokesperson said: 'The account has now be verified and Mrs K should now have full access.'

It apologised for the delay but wouldn't comment on why it had happened and what the usual time scale for verification is.

Whilst Amazon is keeping its cards close to its chest about the verification process, at least you now have access to your funds and can prepare for the Christmas rush.

However, from looking online, it seems that many other businesses are in this dilemma with some having tens of thousands of pounds in locked payment accounts.

Others are struggling to sell any of their items before their account is fully verified by Amazon.

Many have taken to social media to report their problems.

One user said she had been waiting four months to be verified on Amazon to sell her book

Another Amazon seller had also been waiting four months and said 'there is no end in sight'

Many users said they hadn't heard from Amazon as to when they could expect to get verified

Hit and miss: This week's naughty and nice list

Each week, I look at some of the companies that have fallen short of expected standards as well as those that have gone that extra mile for customers.

Miss: This week, reader Stephen, wrote in about his issues with car manufacturer, Mercedes Benz.

He said: 'Two years I treated myself to a Mercedes Benz and took out a three year service care plan which I paid for upfront.

'At the beginning of June I sold the car and contacted Mercedes Benz to cancel the plan. They cancelled it and told me I was due a refund of £610.06.

'They informed me that as the plan was taken out with the Norwich dealership they would contact them to arrange a refund direct.

'A couple of weeks passed, and I had received no contact whatsoever and so I telephoned the Norwich dealership. They informed me they couldn't do the refund and referred me back to Mercedes Benz customer assistance centre.

'I've been going back and forth for weeks now and despite several emails and telephone calls I still haven't been given a refund.

'I have no confidence in either the customer service team nor the Norwich dealership resolving this at the moment.'

I contacted Mercedes Benz as you had been patiently waiting months for your refund with no sign of either firm taking responsibility for returning the funds.

Fortunately, the Norwich garage phoned you shortly after and confirmed it has refunded you the funds directly, together with a goodwill payment of £50.

Even though this was beginning to drive you insane, the firm reversed its earlier hesitance and you now have the full payment - plus a bit extra.

Hit: In better news, reader, Paul, wanted to mention the great service he received from BrewDog.

He said: 'I ordered 4 x 12 packs of ale but they sent me 4 x 12 packs of lager in error. I raised a ticket via email and within two days they had delivered the correct ale.

'They also let me keep the lager that was delivered in error which was worth £48. Great service that deserves recognition.'

Despite their recent run-ins with the ASA, it is good to know some customers are still happy with the service from the Scottish brewery.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US is home to the world's most exciting companies, but also to some seriously overvalued shares.

The UK stock market is unloved, but can it be undervalued with the threat of a no-deal Brexit hanging over us.

All this means that investors need to be picky, says Tom Becket, chief investment officer of Psigma Investment Management, who says that the time for simply buying the market and hoping for the best is over.

He joins us on the Investing Show to reflect on a recent trip to the US, explaining how President Trump's economic plans are working out and why although Main Street may be doing better, a divide still remains between it, Wall Street and, of course, Silicon Valley.

The more than 20 per cent falls from their peaks in the share prices of the so-called Faang stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google - has highlighted how even some of the best companies in the US market are at risk of changes in sentiment.

But with the US market making up more than half of the global stock market, investors cannot afford to ignore it completely.

At home in the UK, investors also face a conundrum, with shares beaten down by concerns over what Brexit will mean for companies - although some will benefit from a weaker pound.

Tom joins Simon Lambert, of This is Money, and Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, to talk through the US, the UK and opportunities elsewhere in the world.

Is the Santa rally real?

The approach of December always brings talk of the prospect of a Santa rally, with the suggestion that shares usually rise during the month.

Is this a genuine trend? We look back over 20 years, with the help of some data from Richard Hunter, while Nick Batsford, of Core London, talks us through some chart signals.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The amount you can save into a pension ultimately depends on what you can afford - but the longer you leave it the more you will need to save.

Research regularly shows that we put ambitious targets on our hoped for income in retirement and then underestimate how much we will need to set aside to achieve that.

So how much should you save?

We take a look at what you might want to retire on and how to get there.

How much do you need to save for retirement? We take a look at what you need to consider

First... a quick guide to pensions

There are two main types of pension schemes that you encounter through work, defined contribution and defined benefit - with the latter often known as final salary schemes.

The crucial difference is that with a defined benefit scheme your employer promises to deliver you an income in retirement and is responsible for doing so.

You will most likely have to contribute each month too, putting in the required amount that your employer specifies.

On the other hand if you have a defined contribution scheme, you save into this and get contributions from your employer too. The money is invested to build up a pot, which will then fund your retirement.

With a defined benefit pension the simple answer to how much to save is straightforward: put in as much as your employer asks for in order to get the pension it promises.

With a defined contribution scheme the answer is more complicated, because the onus is on you to deliver the money you need in retirement - so the more you save the more you will get.

When you reach retirement you can keep your pension invested and draw money as income, or buy a regular income until you die in the form of a financial product called an annuity.

If you save into a personal pension this will be a defined contribution-type plan. You pay money in, invest it and build up a pot.

How much do you need in retirement?

There are a couple of essential things to consider when thinking about how much you would need in retirement.

The first is that your outgoings are likely to be lower. One general rule used in the financial industry is that someone aged 40 would need about 50 per cent of their current income to have the same standard of life in retirement.

This works on the basis that by the time they retire they will be mortgage-free, not supporting children and no longer spending as much on things such as commuting and other costs involved in going to work each day.

The second thing to consider is the state pension. Under the new flat-rate state pension scheme this is £155.65 per week, which is £8,094 per year.

Allowing for a full state pension, someone targeting retirement income of £23,000 would need other pension income of about £16,000.

The pension pot needed to deliver that income based on taking a 4 per cent income from funds that stayed invested in retirement would be £400,000.

Legal & General has an annuity calculator showing how much income you could expect from a pension pot with an annuity.

How much should you save?

Obviously, the amount that you need to save each month depends on how big a pension you want.

But it also depends on your age.

For example, you may get a decent level of retirement income if you start in your 20s by paying in 12 per cent of your salary, but if you leave it until you're over 40 then you might need to pay in closer to 20 per cent to get the same level of retirement income.

Jamie Jenkins, pensions expert at Standard Life, says: ‘While 15 per cent is a good target to aim for, many people will start by paying less than this and increase their contributions gradually.'

The good news is that the money going into your pension doesn't just rely on you. Your employer will contribute too and many offer more generous contributions than the bare minimum that auto-enrolment pensions specify.

You also get income tax relief on your contributions into a pension scheme, meaning that you effectively save out of untaxed income.

There are some general rules of thumb for working out what percentage of your salary needs to be going into a pension, in terms of your and your employer's contributions.

The most common is half your age from when you started saving from - so if you start at age 30 it could be 15 per cent, whereas if you start at 40 it is 20 per cent.

A more accurate view can be delivered by the wealth of pension calculators our there. Many allow you to put in your age, salary, required pension income and any current pension contributions or pots. You can then play around with the numbers.

Calculators to help you work out your pension saving

The pension calculator below powered by Fidelity allows you to put in your details and work out how much you might have in terms of a total pot and future income - and compare that against what you hope for.

Investment returns are calculated using projections by the investment specialist and show what you could expect under average market performance and poor market performance (it's worth noting that you may get lucky and get above average performance).

Future income projections are adjusted for inflation, allowing you to make a direct comparison between your income now and potential future income expressed in today's terms.

Here are links to some more of the best that we have found:

> Aviva pension calculator

(Shows potential pot and compares drawdown and annuity)

> Money Advice Service pension calculator

(Works on your personal scenario)

> Standard Life pension calculator

(Quick and simple to use)

The key thing is to look at what your projected income will be when you reach retirement and then try to work out if this will be adequate.

However, be warned, it can be confusing and demoralising to work out how your savings today will translate into income when you retire.

The reality is that when you start saving for retirement you may not be able to pay in as much as you would like. However, it's important to remember that payments can be upped at any time and the early you start the better chance you have of building a bigger pot.

HOW MUCH WOULD 15% OF SALARY DELIVER? Aviva's pension calculator suggests a 35-year-old currently on £35,000 who saved 10 per cent of their salary with their employer adding 5 per cent for the rest of their career would build up a pot worth £283,000 by their state pension age of 68. They are forecast to get a state pension of about £8,000. If they used income drawdown for retirement they could have an income of £21,000 per year from age 68 to 94, when their pension pot would run out. After this their income would drop to the state pension. Alternatively, an annuity would deliver an income of £16,915 for the rest of their life.

Investing for retirement doesn't have to be into a pension

It makes sense to take the maximum advantage of any offer to match contributions that your employer makes.

For example, if they will match up to 5 per cent of what you put in, then putting in that maximum 5 per cent means that you make the most of your employer's scheme.

Above this level, you will still benefit from tax relief on contributions but won't get any more boost from your work scheme.

That means that because of the restrictions surrounding pension savings - primarily that you cannot access them until at least age 55 - some people choose to invest extra sums elsewhere.

So for example, you could put an extra 5 per cent of your salary into an investment Isa, where you do not get any tax relief on contributions but any income that you eventually draw from it should be tax-free.

How to balance a pension against other investments such as an Isa comes down to personal choice.

Top of the pile: The earlier you start saving for retirement, the better.

Pension essentials - the things you need to know

Defined contribution vs defined benefit

There are two main types of pension schemes - defined contribution and defined benefit schemes (also known as final salary)..

A defined contribution pension will usually allow members to decide how much of their salary they want to pay in and these payments will matched by their employers, at least up to a certain level.

The money is saved into a pension and then invested into funds with the view that it will grow over the years to deliver a retirement pot.

You are able to track the investments, measure how they are performing and change them if you wish.

However, it’s up to you to build up your pot needed for retirement, so it’s important to keep payments up once you start and reassess how much you can afford to pay in every few years.

With a defined benefit pension scheme your employer will usually pay out a certain amount of your final salary when you retire and they will take responsibility for funding that.

There are other types of defined benefit schemes, such as career-adjusted schemes where you'll be paid a proportion of your average earnings during your employment.

Different pension providers will run schemes in different ways, so it's worth checking with your provider for the full details.

However, defined benefit pension schemes have turned out to be very expensive for companies and as a result they have become rare in private businesses and are usually only offered in the public sector.

Most people with some years left to work will find themselves reliant on a defined contribution pension for a hefty chunk of their retirement income.

Types of work pension Defined contribution pension A worker agrees to pay in a set amount into their defined contribution pension scheme, say 5 per cent of their earnings. Their employer may match this, so 10 per cent of their total earnings goes into the pension each month (5% + 5%). The money is invested in stock market funds and the pot grows over the years. On retirement the saver must take their pot and buy an income with it or draw on it for one. Defined benefit pension A worker agrees to pay in a certain amount per month into their final salary pension, say 8 per cent of their earnings. In return, their employer will pay them a set chunk of their final salary for every year they have worked there, in this case one-sixtieth. Someone who has worked at the company and been a pension scheme member for 40 years would therefore retire on two-thirds of their final salary (40/60ths).

What is pension auto-enrolment about?

Many people have been paying into a pension with work for many years, but not all companies had schemes and this means millions were missing out on saving for retirement

As a result, the government tasked The Pensions Regulator with making sure that employers roll out a scheme considered vital to ensuring that people have more retirement income to top up state pension payments.

The rules mean that if you're an employee then your employer must offer you a pension scheme.

These rules if you're at least 22 years-old and employed with a salary of at least £10,000 a year.

You have the option to say ‘no’ to auto-enrolment if you don’t want to join, but if you do nothing then you’ll automatically get signed up.

By 2018 all employers by law will have to contribute to their employees’ pensions, but to start with only bigger firms had to offer this.

Over 5 million people have been auto enrolled since it started in October 2012, and less than 1 in 10 have chosen to opt out, according to government figures.

The law says a minimum percentage of your ‘qualifying earnings’ must be paid into your workplace scheme, this means either the amount you earn before tax between £5,824 and £42,385 a year, or your entire salary or wages before tax. It depends on how your employer chooses to work out qualifying earnings.

At the moment the minimum rates are low, with around 1 per cent of your salary from you and 1 per cent from your employer. That will increase to 4 per cent from you and 3 per cent from your employer by 2018.

In practice, minimum amounts may be higher for you or your employer, because of individual schemes rules.

AUTO-ENROLMENT: WHAT ARE THE MINIMUM PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS? The minimum you pay The minimum your employer pays The government pays 0.8% of your 'qualifying earnings' rising to 4% by 2018 1% of your 'qualifying earnings; rising to 3% by 2018 0.2% of your 'qualifying earnings' rising to 1% by 2018

Tax relief on contributions to your pension pot

Tax relief on contributions to your pension pots means that some of the money that would have gone as income tax goes into your pension instead.

If you pay money into a pension yourself or its taken by your employer from your pay, then you’ll automatically get 20 per cent tax relief.

For example, you’re a lower rate tax payer and you put £80 of your tax-home pay into your pension. You would have earned £100 before income tax was applied, so you would get tax relief of £20.

It gets a bit more complicated if you’re a 40 per cent higher rate tax payer as you can claim relief on the extra 20 per cent - but may have to do this yourself - while top-rate taxpayers can claim back up to their 45 per cent tax rate.

How higher rate taxpayers get their tax relief depends on their pension scheme. Some will have it automatically done for them, others will have to write to HMRC or claim it back through self-assessment. Ask your employer what you need to do.

Tax relief on pensions is limited. It is capped at 100 per cent of your earnings in a year, or by the £40,000 per year annual allowance. A £1million lifetime allowance on the size of a pension pot also applies, which includes money you pay in and what it grows too, above this it is no longer tax efficient to save into a pension.

Personal pensions

If you're self-employed or keen to boost your pension pot you can set up your own personal pension in addition - or instead of - your work pension and invest through that too.

You can opt for a simple stakeholder pension, or a more flexible self-invested personal pension, known as a Sipp.

You also get tax relief on your personal pension pot contributions, as explained above.

Don't forget about the state pension

As well as your work or personal pension, those with enough qualifying years of National Insurance payments will get a basic state pension payment provided by the Government - which is now £155.65 per week for a single person under the new flat rate system.

The state pension age is due to be increased over the next few years, you can use HMRC's state pension calculator to see when you will be eligible for it.

For a 35-year-old today, the state pension age will be 68.

Although it might not seem like a big amount it's a good foundation on which to build your retirement income.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Children as young as eight have been caught behind the wheel on UK roads in the past three-and-a-half years, shocking new figures have revealed.

The legal age for driving a car in Britain is 17, although you can apply for a provisional licence at 15 and nine months, while some quadricycles - like the quirky Renault Twizy - allow youngsters to legally hit the road at the age of 16.

A 16-year-old can also ride a moped after passing a Compulsory Basic Training course) and some mobility patients are allowed to drive cars from the same age if given special permission.

However, official records show there are some drivers half that age being pinched at the controls of cars on our roads.

Junior joyriders: Children as young as 8 years of age have been caught at the wheel of motor vehicles in Britain since 2018

New data harvested via a Freedom of the Information request to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) by Select Car Leasing revealed the shockingly young profile of joyriders caught in the act.

Latest available figures provided by the government agency stretch as far back as the start of 2018 and include stats up to 12 June 2021.

They show the number of young people under the age of 17 who have been disqualified from driving and the country in which they live.

The youngest person prosecuted in the first half of this year was an 11-year-old male in England.

But in both 2018 and 2019 there were up to five boys nicked in charge of a vehicle aged just eight.

And in 2019 there were also up to five girls of the same age disqualified.

The DVLA does not give a precise number if the figure is below five because it 'could lead to the identification of individuals'.

UK courts have the power to disqualify those legally too young to drive. Once that disqualification period has expired, the individual, on reaching the legal age to obtain a driving licence, may apply for one. For someone caught at the age of 8, it means they should have no issue getting their hands on a licence at the age of 17

The overall figures show there were far more males than females caught driving while under 17.

For both genders it was 16-year-olds, just months shy of gaining a provisional licence, who were the worst offenders.

From the start of 2018 up to 12 June this year, a whopping 6,114 males aged 16 were disqualified compared to just 192 females.

Do driving disqualifications carry over if a person is below the legal age? UK courts have the power to disqualify those legally too young to drive. A spokesman for the DVLA said: 'Non-licence holders disqualified by a court are dealt with in the same way as GB driving licence holders. 'In such cases a non-licence holder record is set up so that the offence can be recorded. 'Once the disqualification period has expired, the individual, on reaching the legal age to obtain a driving licence, may apply to do so. 'Any licence issued will show the details of any current endorsements.' That means those cases of eight-year-old drivers caught since the starts of 2018 are likely to be able to apply for a licence without issue when they turn 17 - granted they are not reprimanded at the wheel again before then.

Other troubling figures showed there were up to five 11-year-old boys disqualified in England for each of the years in question, while a staggering 48 boys aged 12 fell foul of the law for driving across the same time period.

But the good news for road safety is that the number of offenders is dropping.

There were 3,512 drivers under 17 disqualified in 2018, which increased slightly to 3,541 in 2019.

That dipped last year to 2,981, influenced by the Covid lockdown restrictions that kept people in their homes for months.

In the first half of this year there were only 259 offenders.

Graham Conway, managing director of Select Car Leasing - the man behind the submission of the FOI request - said that despite the decline the figures are 'hugely worrying for anyone who legally ventures onto the roads'.

He adds: 'Not only are these underage motorists driving without a licence, they also have no insurance and obviously a complete lack of training and practice required to safely take charge of a vehicle.

'They are therefore putting the lives of many people in danger – other drivers and passengers, plus pedestrians who could be involved in serious incidents if things go badly wrong.

'Even more worrying is the fact that this data is only for those who have been caught. There are bound to be many more underage drivers who undertake this potentially lethal pursuit and have so far escaped prosecution.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The future of The Bachelor has been called into question following record-low ratings this season.

And while some experts have blamed the failure of Jimmy Nicholson's season on 'franchise fatigue', one Bachelorette star has offered a very different explanation.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph on Saturday, Luke McLeod claimed the global pandemic is to blame for this season's waning ratings.

Blame it on Covid! Bachelorette star Luke McLeod, 37, (pictured) believes that the failure of Jimmy Nicholson's season of The Bachelor can be chalked up to viewers' desire for 'uplifting' content amid the pandemic

Luke, 37, who appeared on Sophie Monk's season in 2017, explained: 'There's so much heaviness in the news – people don't want to see that when they flick over to their escapism shows as well; people want to be uplifted.'

The wellness influencer added: 'When The Bachelor focuses on the love story rather than the rivalries or drama, it can be like that.'

It comes after Channel 10 began airing double episodes of The Bachelor last week in an effort to finish Jimmy Nicholson's ratings-starved season quicker.

Another nail in The Bachelor's coffin: It comes after Channel 10 began airing double episodes to finish Jimmy Nicholson's (pictured) ratings-starved season quicker

The show, which has suffered the worst ratings in the franchise's eight-year history, aired two episodes back to back in the 7.30pm time slot on Thursday.

There will be another double episode on Wednesday, August 18.

While it's common for networks to truncate seasons that aren't performing, a 10 spokesperson told Perth Now these double episodes have 'always been planned'.

Oh, dear: The show, which has suffered the worst ratings in the franchise's eight-year history, aired two episodes back to back in the 7.30pm time slot on Thursday

Viewers flocked to Twitter to complain about the 'boring' ordeal of sitting through two full-length episodes, with one asking: 'Haven't we suffered enough?'

Another tweeted: 'I was so excited for this double episode, thinking there was going to be so much extra drama.'

'I am wallowing in despair that it's just two normal episodes stuck together.'

'This episode is long': Viewers flocked to Twitter to complain about the 'boring' ordeal of sitting through two full-length episodes, with one asking: 'Haven't we suffered enough?'

'I have to say, no offence but this double episode is killing me,' another agreed.

The Bachelor had its lowest-ever premiere ratings last month, with just 482,000 metro viewers tuning in for pilot Jimmy's first episode.

This number collapsed to a new record low of 360,000 a week later, following the start of the Tokyo Olympics on Seven.

Channel 10 was forced earlier this week to deny claims The Bachelor was being axed.

A well-placed insider told Daily Mail Australia on Monday the program's future hangs in the balance as viewers tune out in favour of other reality dating shows.

The series will 'inevitably' be cancelled, they said, if Brooke Blurton's upcoming season of The Bachelorette doesn't see a significant boost in ratings.

Is it the end? Channel 10 was forced this week to deny claims The Bachelor was being axed as the show continues to deliver record-low ratings. Pictured: The Bachelor host Osher Günsberg

'It wouldn't have mattered who they chose [as the Bachelor]; those numbers were always going to be low,' the insider explained, noting the steady decline in ratings over the years.

They added that having a bisexual Bachelorette - Brooke - with male and female contestants was a 'last-ditch attempt' at revitalising the franchise, but if this doesn't work, the series 'is going to lose its entire audience'.

The source also claimed Channel 10 executives were scouting for an 'international dating format' to replace the series next year.

Despite this information coming for a reliable source, a 10 spokesperson denied The Bachelor was being axed when contacted for comment by Daily Mail Australia.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Since the earliest days of the pandemic, all sorts of sweeping statements have been made about how it was going to change the way we lived, for good.

Working from home would become the norm. Local high streets would flourish as city centres fell into obsolescence. And there would be a mass exodus from Britain's urban hubs to the countryside, as office workers were liberated from their daily commutes.

By and large, those predictions came true for many people, at least in Covid's darkest days.

House hunting: Finding a new place to live in South London following the pandemic 'exodus' has not been as easy as I hoped it would be, writes Helen Crane

Not for me, though. Not only am I one of the seemingly few people left who still enjoys city life, but the part of the country where my family lives - the only area I would have a reason to move to - is too far to commute to the office in London, even if it was just for one or two days a week.

But plenty of people - some of my twenty and thirty-something London friends included - have made their escape to the country.

Some of them bought homes and contributed to the housing boom of the past year, but others continued to rent.

Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent and a former RICS residential chairman, tells me: 'At the beginning of the pandemic, we found that many people moved out of cities, even circumventing the suburbs on the way, because they realised they wouldn't be commuting for a while.

'There was no need to be near the centre of activity, paying higher rents. The race for space, a place where they could work from home and enjoy a garden, were top of the wish list.'

So when I set out on my search for a large one or two-bed flat to rent in South London for myself and my partner recently, I'll admit I was feeling rather smug.

With so many people having left, I thought I would have my pick of homes to rent in areas like Brixton, Balham and Dulwich - which, pre-pandemic, were known as hotspots for young professionals and families starting out.

The days of traipsing around endless bog-standard flats, only to find that they had been snapped up by someone else while I was still grimacing at the inside of the cooker, were surely gone.

Property market experts say that renters are returning to cities now that they have been asked to come back to the office part-time, leading to an increase in demand for homes

When I moved to London a decade ago, I lived in not one but two flats with a resident rat; a house where the front door didn't lock; and another where the shower was conveniently located in a cupboard in the kitchen.

Things have improved a lot since then, but as this will hopefully be my final rented flat before I am able to buy, I thought that this was a chance to find a nicer place than ever before.

And with rents apparently declining in London, I hoped I might even be able to bag a bargain.

I'm sad to say that it has been nowhere near that simple.

A flat with 17 viewings and one with sealed bids...

Earlier this week, I viewed a one-bedroom flat in Tooting. It was in reasonably good order, but quite small and nothing special.

We ruled it out partly because the ceiling in the bathroom was too low for my 6ft 4 partner to properly stand up.

So I couldn't believe it when the agent told me that there were 17 viewings scheduled for that evening alone.

Landlords have been taking advantage of high demand by instructing agents to ask prospective tenants to go in to sealed bids, where they state the highest rent they would pay

The day before that, we had looked around a two-bed in Streatham, where the only viewing slot available was a 45-minute open house on a Tuesday afternoon.

We knew instantly it wasn't for us. The wallpaper was peeling, the bathroom looked damp and the whole place smelled like dog. We took a cursory look around and left.

A few minutes later, I received an email from the agent telling us that we had two hours to submit what was essentially a sealed bid, detailing how much over the 'asking' rent we would be willing to pay to secure the flat.

Based on other places I'd seen in the area, they were already asking for more than the place was worth - but there must have been plenty of interest for them to initiate a bidding war.

Along with a few other disappointing viewings, we also had to take around half the properties we liked off our list because they had been snapped up before we even had a chance to attend our appointment.

Feeling slightly exasperated, I decided to ask some agents why I'd been having so much trouble finding a flat.

According to Daniel Parker, lettings director at Savills, I was just too late.

Over the past month, he says demand for rented flats has been 'extraordinary' as young professionals looked to return to London, and domestic and international students getting back on campus for this academic year.

'Last year there were instances of tenants looking for a bargain but that window has well and truly passed now,' he says.

'Offices right across London are reporting cases of new launches receiving 20-plus calls from the moment they're put online, properties going within a matter of hours and tenants offering above guide to secure something.'

We also haven't helped ourselves by looking for the same type of flat, in the same location, as pretty much everyone else.

By looking for a place with space for two people to work from home and ideally a garden or terrace, we have been pitting ourselves against a wave of returning young professionals.

Larger flats are in high demand in cities, as tenants search for space to work from home

'Larger apartments with both working from home space and outside space are most sought after as post pandemic, tenants' preferences have changed,' says Chris Morris, head of lettings at Cluttons.

As well as changes in tenant's behaviour, the choices made by landlords in the last year have also dictated the type of properties that are available in Britain's inner cities.

When house prices rocketed amid the stamp duty holiday, some inner-city landlords took the opportunity to sell up - especially if their tenants had moved out or asked for rent reductions during lockdown.

Others have decided to rent their homes via AirBnb in recent years, as they can make far more money, usually with fewer tax obligations.

This is even more of a problem in the UK's coastal towns, where some renters now find it all but impossible to find a decent home.

All of this means less rented homes to choose from, driving up competition for those that are available.

The one positive we have found in our search is that rents, while not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, seem only slightly higher than they were the last time I was looking for a new flat in 2019.

In normal circumstances, I would have expected them to be substantially more - though they are clearly being driven up above the advertised price in some cases by agents asking for sealed bids.

Inner London rents are 16.5 per cent down on the same time last year, according to Hamptons - though I don't feel that they have fallen that dramatically in the areas where I am looking, on the border between inner and outer London.

In any case, they are now on the rise again. According to Hamptons, the average rent in inner London rose by 4.3 per cent in a month in June, the first monthly rise since the beginning of the pandemic and now averaging £2,103 per month.

This will be a familiar experience to tenants in other cities across the UK, where rents have continued to rise throughout pandemic.

As for us, we've now hopefully - and finally - secured a nice two-bed flat on a pretty terraced street, crossed t's and dotted i's pending.

We had to forfeit the garden flat that we initially wanted in order to find a place in a good location, with enough space for us to both work from home - but with a large park around the corner, and summer coming to an end anyway, that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Put off by pushy agents, tight deadlines and opaque 'best offer' situations, we ended up cutting out the middleman and using the website Open Rent, where potential tenants deal directly with the landlord.

No bidding war, no admin fees, and hopefully a nice home for us while we save up the last of the money we need to get out of renting for good.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the crucial Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow approaches, the questions are multiplying.

Can the Government cajole the nation to drive electric cars and embrace other energy-saving measures to stop global temperatures rising?

As for investors, a dilemma faces anyone who cares about the planet, but wants a decent return at the same time.

Recent floods and storms highlight the impact of global warming and are making more people consider investments that cut carbon dioxide emissions.

But finding a way through the haze of promises of cleaner air and higher yields is becoming tricky.

Worldwide, an estimated £31trillion is now invested in funds that have an ESG approach, prioritising the environment, sustainability and corporate governance.

The move into the area is being fuelled by concern over these issues – and the belief that change for the better could be lucrative.

Research from David Smith of Aberdeen Standard Investments reveals that companies with the highest ESG ratings have been more profitable and paid higher dividends than their lower-rated counterparts. Investors are increasingly shunning companies perceived as being out of step with the ESG agenda, which will further intensify the shift.

But it is not all plain sailing. Liontrust last month failed to reach its £100m target for the launch of a new ESG investment trust, despite the group's record of good performance. I hope that all fund managers will see this set back as a wake-up call to be more open about their objectives and how they will achieve them.

And the desire to attract cash is leading to concerns that some funds may be 'greenwashing'.

They may boast of their attachment to sustainability, but are merely box-ticking and thus misleading investors.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently warned that 'ESG assertions must be reasonable and substantiated'.

The severity of the watchdog's tone suggests fund managers would be advised to comply.

Yet even if they do moderate the greenwash hyperbole, the debate surrounding some funds' holdings will remain.

Passive funds that track the FTSE 4Good US Select index – which excludes companies in armaments, fossil fuels and tobacco – often hold shares in tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google's owner Alphabet. These groups have ambitious carbon reduction goals, meaning they score highly on some of the multiplicity of ESG metrics. About 14 different frameworks are used for stock selection.

Nick Edgerton, manager of the Stewart Investors Worldwide Sustainability fund, contends that some business practices at Amazon and the rest make them unsuitable for inclusion.

Others maintain the argument is more nuanced. Taking a stake in a company should be a route to reform, a stance advocated by fund manager Baillie Gifford.

Declining to work with a controversial business like Rio Tinto, for example, would potentially result in 'poorer mining standards, more environmental damage, and slower progress towards the low-carbon economy we all need'.

Fund managers also stress the need to take an objective look at a company's operations. Matthew Beddall of Havelock cites Kronos, a German manufacturer of plastic bottling machinery. Its products may seem to pile further threat on the fragile ecology of the planet. But Kronos can retrofit drinks companies' equipment to use recycled plastics.

The Cop26 summit, which starts on October 31, has been described as an inflection point in the progress to a net zero target.

The wish to take advantage of the transition to an ultra-low carbon economy means that I am an investor in several ESG funds and trusts, including Liontrust's Sustainable Future Global Growth. I am relaxed about tech holdings, but want to feel that my money is backing businesses bent on delivering solutions.

Mike Appleby of Liontrust says the group likes technologies that cut energy waste and so lower companies' bills: 'Take Daikin, a Japanese group which is innovating in air conditioning. They've done away with ducting and instead put much more efficient separate units in each room.'

Another holding in the Liontrust sustainable stable is the SDCL Energy Efficiency Income trust which invests in energy efficiency infrastructure projects.

At present this trust is at a 13 per cent premium to the value of its net assets, making it an expensive foray into ESG for those who trust the FCA's intervention curtails virtue signalling and encourages a new era of delivering rewards for investors.

However, Jupiter Green, another trust, is at a 9 per cent discount and gives useful exposure to renewables through Vestas, the Danish manufacturer of Wind Turbines.

Jake Moeller of fund analysts Square Mile likes the Ninety One Global Environmental fund which owns Waste Management, America's largest recycling business.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Trawling through Government Covid statistics might seem like a strange hobby for a 16-year-old.

But when he isn't practising on his guitar, or watching TikTok videos, that's what Jacob Mellor can be found doing. And thanks to his keen interest in 'the data', he has come to a decision – one that could have a profound impact on his own health and that of those around him.

Earlier this month, when it was announced that all 16- and 17-year-olds would be offered a Covid jab, Jacob promptly announced he would be opting out. All the evidence, he says, shows this virus is not a threat to him. And so he feels it would be better to catch Covid, and develop natural immunity, than to have a vaccine.

'From the beginning we've been told that this virus didn't affect kids,' says Jacob, from Croydon in South London, who attends an independent school. 'We even had assemblies about it at school, telling us why we shouldn't worry because it's just a cold for people my age.

'So why should I take a vaccine to protect against something I won't get ill from? Especially when I know there's a risk involved with having it. The risk is small, I appreciate that, but it's still there and I can't get over that.'

Not only does Jacob have no qualms about catching Covid, he is almost looking forward to it. 'It would be a good thing, in my eyes. I'd build a strong immunity and I wouldn't have to worry about risks, like I would with the jab,' he says.

'Loads of my friends had Covid last year and the worst that happened was that they were stuck in bed for a couple of days. We all see Covid as something we're not really bothered about. If I get it, it might suck for a few days, but I'll be immune, so there's a benefit to me.'

People enjoy their time at a nightclub, as part of a national research programme assessing the risk of Covid transmission in Liverpool in April

According to Jacob's mother Sally, her eldest child – who is one of three, with siblings aged 14 and nine – is 'an independent thinker' and has been 'brought up to appreciate the value of natural immunity'.

Sally, a 51-year-old creative director for a major retailer, and husband Steve, 49, a recruitment director, haven't been vaccinated either. 'I believe in natural immunity, and I'm nervous about the lack of long-term data about the Covid vaccine,' she adds. 'We were a family that would be outside in the dirt and around animals, and I told the kids this would protect them from allergies and make sure they could fight off infections.

'So Jacob has always asked questions when it came to vaccines, from a very young age – like why did he have to have a tetanus booster, for instance – although he did have all his childhood jabs.'

While more than 16,000 of Britain's 1.5 million 16- and 17-year-olds took up the Government's offer to get jabbed last weekend, thousands, like Jacob, are not as enthusiastic. The latest Office for National Statistics Covid survey suggests one in ten of them don't plan to have the vaccine.

Over the past week, The Mail on Sunday has spoken to a number of these youngsters about their stance and why they've come to their decision – despite it meaning they are more likely to infect others. In many cases, perhaps unsurprisingly, their parents have also chosen not to have the vaccine, although all the teenagers said they made the decision for themselves.

A handful, however, had done differently: their parents are vaccinated but they don't plan to be.

The most common reason given is that they think it's safer, and better for their health, to simply catch Covid. It's a view echoed by some well-respected scientists.

Last month, Professor Robert Dingwall, a behavioural scientist and until recently a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said: 'Given the low risk of Covid for most teenagers, it is not immoral to think they may be better protected by natural immunity generated through infection than by asking them to take the possible risk of a vaccine.'

And last week, giving evidence at the All-Party Parliamentry Group on Coronavirus, University of East Anglea virus expert Professor Paul Hunter suggested up to 90 per cent of teens aged 17 may have already been infected. He said: 'Why are we vaccinating an age group where a large majority of them have already had the infection and recovered?'

Could they have a point? It's true, young people are at extremely low risk of severe Covid illness.

A British study of more than 6,338 Covid-related hospital admissions between March 2020 and February this year found 259 were children and teens. This equates to four per cent. Just 25 Covid-related deaths occurred in those months in under-18s – half of whom were clinically vulnerable.

And what of the risks that young people face in having the vaccine?

Teenager Eve Thomson receives a covid vaccination in Scotland earlier this week

In the spring, experts in Israel and the US announced they were investigating a possible link between the Pfizer and Moderna jabs and rare cases of a heart-inflammation condition called myocarditis in men aged 16 to 24. Researchers theorised that young people have especially active immune systems and, in rare cases, this can cause fighter cells to overreact to the vaccine, attacking healthy heart tissue.

For this reason, while other countries pressed ahead with vaccinating children aged 12 and up, UK health chiefs wanted to wait until more information became available. Subsequent data from millions of doses given to American and Israeli children shows the risk of myocarditis is roughly 0.0067 per cent after two doses of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. In most cases, the condition is mild and resolves within a few weeks.

To put that into perspective, British children have a far greater 0.03 to 0.05 per cent risk of a Covid infection triggering paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome – a potentially life-threatening condition. And this is considered incredibly rare, with just 750 cases having been seen in the UK since the start of the pandemic.

Covid fact Canada has said it will soon require all air, train and cruise ship passengers and workers to be vaccinated against Covid. Advertisement

Still, the Government is taking a cautious approach, initially offering one dose only to 16- and 17-year-olds and monitoring side effects closely. But this isn't enough to convince another teenager, 16-year-old Michael Lake, an aspiring musician from Tamworth in Staffordshire.

Having watched YouTube videos featuring commentators questioning the safety of the vaccine, he would rather not take the risk.

'It won't just be one jab,' says the AS-level student. 'We'll have to have loads eventually. And I've seen people on social media saying having a large amount of the vaccine in your body could be bad.

'I'd rather wait until I only have to have one vaccine, which they know works. At the moment there seem to be lots of contradictions about whether there's any point in having one in the first place.'

Like Jacob, Michael believes he would be much better off accruing natural immunity by contracting the virus. 'The best way to be protected is to get Covid and maybe other illnesses to build up your immune system,' says Jacob.

'My friend had it and said it was just a tiny bit worse than flu – but he doesn't want the jab either for the same reasons as me.

'If I got Covid I don't think I'd get ill because I am in the low-risk age range and I think I have a strong immune system. I don't think lockdowns help, keeping everyone inside and away from each other and not able to share germs. If we were all out and about, our immune systems would be much better.'

Another concern of Michael's – and most of the youngsters we spoke to – is the wide range of incentives offered by the Government to encourage young people to get the jab.

Earlier this month Government sources announced plans to offer free and discounted takeaways and taxi rides to teenagers and young people who get the jab. This – along with the prospect of vaccine passports, having to show Covid vaccine status to gain entry to pubs, nightclubs and other venues – has actually turned off teens.

Michael says: 'They [the Government] are getting everyone all excited about the vaccine, hyping it up, telling us all to get it. It makes you think, why? They're saying it's to protect other people, but all those people will have been vaccinated, so why do I need to get it?'

Jonathan Brooks, 17, feels the same. Despite both parents being double-jabbed, he says he refuses 'for political reasons'. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday's Medical Minefield podcast, Jonathan, who is off to study computing at Staffordshire University in September, said: 'Young people's social lives have taken the biggest hit during this pandemic, and now, by setting rules for nightclubs, Ministers are punishing us yet again.

'I think it's coercive, discriminatory and an unworkable policy. I don't agree with the fact my social life is now in the hands of the Government. So, on principle, I've decided not to have it.'

Unlike other teenagers we spoke to, Jonathan doesn't think he would be better off getting Covid, but is confident he would remain relatively unscathed if he were to catch it. 'I know that there are probably higher risks from Covid than the jab itself,' he said. 'Having said that, I don't know anyone who has got very seriously ill with it at my age. There's a chance I had it in January last year when no one was being tested, and I haven't had it since, so I might have some natural immunity anyway.'

Covid fact More than 50,000 children aged between 12 and 15 have been registered to receive a Covid vaccine in Ireland. Advertisement

Jonathan claims roughly a fifth of his friends won't take the vaccine, but for different reasons: 'They've been told the virus poses no threat to them time and time again, and now they can't be convinced otherwise. Then they heard politicians say this vaccine was for adults only and teenagers don't need it. The Government shot itself in the foot with mixed messaging. It's hindered trust for young people.'

Behavioural scientist Professor Ivo Vlaev isn't surprised the Government's jab incentives haven't been well received.

'Incentives can be very effective,' he says – for example, studies show that smokers are more likely to quit if offered rewards of shopping vouchers – 'but in order for incentives to be successful, patients have to trust the authority offering them.

'And this is the problem. Young people have very little trust in the Government at the moment, because they've told them, from the beginning, they are not a priority.

'The advice has also changed quickly and there's been little information provided to help youngsters understand why. When people don't understand a decision, it increases the sense of distrust. And with this level of distrust, incentives feel like a bribe.'

Neither do young people seem convinced that getting jabbed can protect others. 'I think protecting other people is important, of course,' says 17-year-old Jonathan, who lives with his father Daniel, a delivery driver, and mother, Jane.

'I'll wear masks and keep my distance. But vaccines are different because it's a medical procedure. It's also confusing because vulnerable people will be protected by their own jab.'

Jacob agrees. 'My grandma is vaccinated, so I don't feel worried going to see her because I know she is protected, which is important because she's the vulnerable one.'

This was a common line I came across in teens' social media posts – and a fair point. But in truth, the vaccine isn't 100 per cent effective, so a small but significant proportion of vulnerable people will remain at risk, even once jabbed.

When I began researching this article, I expected to hear from teenagers who had been sucked in by the crackpot conspiracy theories that are rife on social media – that the jab makes you magnetic, or contains some sort of electronic mind-control microchip. In reality they presented coherent and convincing arguments.

But risk is a numbers game. The greater the infection rate, the more children will inevitably suffer. Some southern states in the US, for instance, are battling their worst-yet wave of Covid and seeing record numbers of children and teenagers in hospital.

'If infections continue at the current pace for the next month, we could potentially end up with about 5,000 paediatric hospitalisations here in the UK,' says Professor Lawrence Young, virus expert at the University of Warwick Medical School.

'So we could be looking at about 40 deaths, which could be prevented with a vaccine.'

Studies show two doses of the jab can reduce asymptomatic transmission by half, meaning the spread of the virus will further slow.

And while severe Covid illness is rare, it's still unclear what risk is posed by long Covid, whose lingering symptoms include fatigue and breathlessness.

There will be other benefits to vaccinating as many of this agegroup as possible, not directly linked to the infection.

'The more people are vaccinated in the community, the sooner everything improves for everyone,' says Dr Liz Whittaker, an expert in paediatric infectious diseases at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.

'We've seen more young people with mental health problems because of not being able to do normal things like their hobbies and see their friends than we've seen young people with bad Covid. I think that's a reason to try to get back to normality.'

How else can we convince vaccine-hesitant young people to do the right thing?

Prof Vlaev says: 'Public health messages should drive home the fact that the more people are vaccinated, the lower infection rates will be, the more they'll be able to see more of their friends, go on holiday and play football or whatever it is they want to do.

'Set up vaccination hubs in places where lots of young people gather, such as festivals or sports events. Some people will get vaccinated there and then, which is likely to influence others around them to do the same.

'And simple scientific explanations as to why the jab is now being offered to teens would help, to clear up misconceptions about risks and benefits – told by someone who young people feel they can identify with. Not Ministers. Their trust in officials, I'm afraid to say, may be broken.'

This top Isa round-up has keeping our readers updated on the best savings deals since 2014 - and is kept up-to-date throughout the year - bookmark it for the very latest developments.

How an Isa works and why you should have one

Each year in April, savers are given a fresh Isa allowance that qualifies for tax-free interest.

For the 2021/22 financial year, starting 6 April 2021, the limit is £20,000.

Piggy five: We round-up the best tax-free deals - and it is slim pickings at the moment

You can transfer Isa money whichever way you wish between an investment account to savings account, whereas previously you could only shift it from saving to investments.

Although cash Isas don't currently offer fantastic rates, it is still worthwhile opening one to shield money away from the taxman.

Isa rules state you can only contribute to one Isa per tax year.

You can also transfer an old Isa for better returns. Here's a quick guide to Isa saving.

It is possible to switch your current year's cash Isa if you move the entire amount, but it is far simpler to get your choice right in the first place.

Rates are low and that makes the best Isa more important

Banks and building societies should be apologising to savers for the slim pickings on offer here.

The best buy easy-access rate on a tax-free account has plunged under 1 per cent for the first time while no major bank comes close to featuring on the list.

It also comes at a time as inflation races higher, leaving all savers with a serious headache.

Savings rates really are dire at the moment and unfortunately, institutions are doing little to shelter savers from the assault of the low interest rate environment.

The coronavirus crisis cut to 0.1 per cent for the base rate, launch of a new funding scheme to pump cheap money to banks, and expansion of quantitative easing, has made things even worse.

Many now ask themselves why bother?

Yet when rates are low it becomes even more important to make sure you are getting as much as you can from your savings.

We also think an Isa is still worth having, despite the new tax-free savings interest allowance of £1,000 a year for basic rate taxpayers and £500 for higher rate taxpayers.

It's tough to get that much interest now, but one day rates will rise.

Money sheltered in an Isa will deliver a tax-free income, even above that £1,000 level and if you are building up a long-term pot, you may one day be very grateful for that.

And who knows if the personal savings allowance will be around forever - it is much more likely to disappear than the Isa wrapper.

You may also want to look into stocks and shares version of an Isa - how to choose the best (and cheapest) DIY investing Isa.

If you can find a property in a decent location with good tenants then then you should be able to build up a good income from rent.

But the taxman will want to know about any returns you make. If you don't declare your income properly or capital gains when you sell, you could be in trouble.

We run through the taxes associated with buy-to-let.

Some of these taxes and allowances have changed, so make sure you are up-to-date with them.

Becoming a buy-to-let landlord can make you a good return, but it will also add to your tax bill

The taxman and buy-to-let

The taxman has taken a greater interest in people renting our homes in recent years.

To purchase a buy-to-let you need a different type of mortgage to the type you would get for your own home.

Lenders will also want to know if you have begun renting out your existing home because this is usually not allowed under the terms and conditions of a residential mortgage. Often you will have to move to a buy-to-let rate, or get permission to let.

Most banks and building societies offer buy-to-let mortgages. The rates tend to be higher than residential mortgages, which reflects risks such as tenants not paying rent and you defaulting.

Buy-to-let is treated as an investment so is subject to income tax on rent and capital gains tax on sale. You will also have to pay stamp duty on the property purchase.

Inevitably there will be those who think they can get away with dodging some of the taxes levied on buy-to-let. In the past some have, but the taxman has cracked down very heavily on this in recent years - actively making landlords a target.

At the same time, mortgage lenders have also cracked down on those letting property but staying on a residential mortgage.

You are far more likely to get caught out if you try to skip tax today.

Stamp duty

The first tax you will need to pay if you are purchasing a property to start a buy-to-let portfolio is stamp duty when you purchase a property, just as you do with a residential home.

The bad news is that stamp duty has been increased in recent years for buy-to-let and second homes. A change arrived in April 2016 that added a 3 per cent surcharge to all the stamp duty bands - in some cases this trebles the bill.

The good news is that the first £500,000 of the purchase price is currently exempt under the rules of Treasury's stamp duty cut.

Stamp duty charge

So while they will still have to pay the 3 per cent surcharge, landlords will now see their stamp duty bill significantly reduced when purchasing new property thanks to the Chancellor's measures.

While many home buyers particularly in the South East and London will undoubtedly benefit, the average landlord purchase will also see big savings.

For example as illustrated in the chart below a £400,000 second home will now only carry a stamp duty bill of £12,000 rather than £22,000.

While this is still £12,000 more than a residential purchase due to the 3 per cent surcharge, the landlord will still now save £10,000, the same as a standard home buyer would by not paying any tax at all.

This relief will be in place until 31 March of next year.

You can claim back some stamp duty by offsetting it against any capital gains tax liability when you sell.

Tax on rent

A recent change landlords will still be feeling is the replacement of mortgage interest tax relief with a 20 per cent credit.

In the past, private residential landlords with a mortgage on their buy-to-let property could simply deduct their mortgage interest from rental income before calculating tax.

This all changed in April 2017 when a new regime was brought to phase out this relief, replacing it eventually with a 20 per cent tax credit and calculation that means most landlords will pay more in income tax.

The change largely affects landlords paying higher rate tax, who will now pay tax on rental income based on revenue rather than their profit after mortgage interest is paid.

It can also affect basic rate taxpayers, who may find themselves pulled up a tax band by the way the calculation is done.

For example, under the old system a basic rate tax paying landlord with a salary of £25,000, rental income of £15,000 from their buy-to-let property and mortgage interest payments of £10,000 would have been able to subtract those interest payments from the rental income, bringing the taxable amount down to £5,000.

Added to their salary their taxable income would have been £30,000. Once the personal allowance of £12,500 has been subtracted, this would bring their total taxable income down to £17,500.

Overall, on this amount of taxable income a basic rate taxpayer would have paid a total of £3,500 in tax.

This has all changed now that the new fiscal regime has been brought in.

From now on, landlords will get no deduction for their interest cost and just a 20 per cent credit on the whole amount.

Very little changes for our previous example of a basic rate tax paying landlord with a salary of £25,000, rental income of £15,000 and mortgage interest payments of £10,000.

Under the new regime, they would be paying tax on the full £15,000 rental income. They would also get the 20 per cent tax credit on their interest payments worth £2,000.

With a salary of £25,000, our landlord's taxable income would now be £40,000.

Take away the £12,500 personal allowance and you get the final taxable income of £27,500, 20 per cent of which is £5,500.

With the tax credit this is reduced to £3,500, the same amount as before.

But higher and additional rate tax payers will almost certainly end up paying more - and as rental income is now added to income before the tax credit is used, it can push people up a tax bracket.

The example below shows how the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief would affect a 40 per cent tax payer with £3,000 taxable income:

How has mortgage interest tax relief been phased out?

Capital gains tax

When you come to sell your buy-to-let property, there will be capital gains tax to pay on any profit.

It applies to any property which is not your main home, known as your Principal Private Residence. This gets a special exemption.

On property sales CGT is levied at 18 per cent or 28 per cent depending on whether people are basic rate or higher rate taxpayers.

However, gains are added to income to deliver a total amount that decides this. This means that in practice most landlords making decent profits should pay the 28 per cent rate.

If you only have one property and it is considered your principal home, then you do not have to pay CGT, however, the taxman may want evidence that you were actually living there.

There are two reliefs you can get on your CGT bill, but they are both less generous than they once were.

Landlords who used to live in their rental properties saw certain reliefs taken away this year

Private residence relief

Along with the scrapping of mortgage interest tax relief, a new capital gains tax regime has been brought in for 'accidental' landlords.

These are landlords who once lived in a property before going on to let it out.

If a landlord rents out a property that was once their main home, capital gains tax only applies on the amount the home went up in value while they weren't living there.

Previously landlords could also add an extra 18 months onto the amount of time they lived at the property - this is known as the 'final period exemption'.

But as of this tax year that has now been reduced to nine months.

As an example of how this works, under the old rules a landlord who has owned their property for 10 years and lived in it for two would only be taxed on six-and-a-half years of capital gains – the 10 year period minus the two years of residency and the added 18 months' relief.

But now they'll be taxed on seven years and three months of capital gains – the 10 years, minus the two years residency plus the reduced nine months' relief.

Lettings relief

'Lettings relief' has also been rolled back this year.

Previously, when a landlord sold their former home after renting it out, up to £40,000 of their gain can be exempted from capital gains tax.

Couples could benefit from an exemption of up to £80,000.

Under the new rules however only landlords who live in the property with their tenants now qualify for this benefit.

Offsetting stamp duty and estate agent's fees

Have a buy-to-let tax question? Taxes for landlords have changed dramatically in recent years. This guide is regularly updated to keep you informed on the current rules. If you have any questions on buy-to-let tax that you can't find answered here, get in touch at editor@thisismoney.co.uk

You can reduce your CGT bill by deducting some of the expenses associated with buying and managing a property.

You can offset costs such as the stamp duty paid when you purchased the property as well as solicitors’ fees, estate agent’s fees to market the property, and surveyors' fees if a survey was carried out when you purchased the property.

You may also be able to offset losses on other property against your capital gains tax bill.

Inheritance tax

When you die any buy-to-lets will form part of your estate.

There may be a tax charge to pay of 40 per cent if the total estate exceeds £325,000 or £650,000 for married couples.

There are ways to reduce your inheritance tax liability by making gifts to relatives and putting bits of your estate in trust. This is much more complex with a property than it is with cash, shares or funds, which can be passed over in small chunks.

From this year each individual is offered a 'family home allowance' of £175,000, so they can pass their home on to their children or grandchildren tax-free after their death. The family home allowance is added to the existing £325,000 Inheritance Tax threshold.

This allowance does not apply to buy-to-let properties.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The amount you can save into a pension ultimately depends on what you can afford - but the longer you leave it the more you will need to save.

Research regularly shows that we put ambitious targets on our hoped for income in retirement and then underestimate how much we will need to set aside to achieve that.

So how much should you save?

We take a look at what you might want to retire on and how to get there.

How much do you need to save for retirement? We take a look at what you need to consider

First... a quick guide to pensions

There are two main types of pension schemes that you encounter through work, defined contribution and defined benefit - with the latter often known as final salary schemes.

The crucial difference is that with a defined benefit scheme your employer promises to deliver you an income in retirement and is responsible for doing so.

You will most likely have to contribute each month too, putting in the required amount that your employer specifies.

On the other hand if you have a defined contribution scheme, you save into this and get contributions from your employer too. The money is invested to build up a pot, which will then fund your retirement.

With a defined benefit pension the simple answer to how much to save is straightforward: put in as much as your employer asks for in order to get the pension it promises.

With a defined contribution scheme the answer is more complicated, because the onus is on you to deliver the money you need in retirement - so the more you save the more you will get.

When you reach retirement you can keep your pension invested and draw money as income, or buy a regular income until you die in the form of a financial product called an annuity.

If you save into a personal pension this will be a defined contribution-type plan. You pay money in, invest it and build up a pot.

How much do you need in retirement?

There are a couple of essential things to consider when thinking about how much you would need in retirement.

The first is that your outgoings are likely to be lower. One general rule used in the financial industry is that someone aged 40 would need about 50 per cent of their current income to have the same standard of life in retirement.

This works on the basis that by the time they retire they will be mortgage-free, not supporting children and no longer spending as much on things such as commuting and other costs involved in going to work each day.

The second thing to consider is the state pension. Under the new flat-rate state pension scheme this is £155.65 per week, which is £8,094 per year.

Allowing for a full state pension, someone targeting retirement income of £23,000 would need other pension income of about £16,000.

The pension pot needed to deliver that income based on taking a 4 per cent income from funds that stayed invested in retirement would be £400,000.

Legal & General has an annuity calculator showing how much income you could expect from a pension pot with an annuity.

How much should you save?

Obviously, the amount that you need to save each month depends on how big a pension you want.

But it also depends on your age.

For example, you may get a decent level of retirement income if you start in your 20s by paying in 12 per cent of your salary, but if you leave it until you're over 40 then you might need to pay in closer to 20 per cent to get the same level of retirement income.

Jamie Jenkins, pensions expert at Standard Life, says: ‘While 15 per cent is a good target to aim for, many people will start by paying less than this and increase their contributions gradually.'

The good news is that the money going into your pension doesn't just rely on you. Your employer will contribute too and many offer more generous contributions than the bare minimum that auto-enrolment pensions specify.

You also get income tax relief on your contributions into a pension scheme, meaning that you effectively save out of untaxed income.

There are some general rules of thumb for working out what percentage of your salary needs to be going into a pension, in terms of your and your employer's contributions.

The most common is half your age from when you started saving from - so if you start at age 30 it could be 15 per cent, whereas if you start at 40 it is 20 per cent.

A more accurate view can be delivered by the wealth of pension calculators our there. Many allow you to put in your age, salary, required pension income and any current pension contributions or pots. You can then play around with the numbers.

Calculators to help you work out your pension saving

The pension calculator below powered by Fidelity allows you to put in your details and work out how much you might have in terms of a total pot and future income - and compare that against what you hope for.

Investment returns are calculated using projections by the investment specialist and show what you could expect under average market performance and poor market performance (it's worth noting that you may get lucky and get above average performance).

Future income projections are adjusted for inflation, allowing you to make a direct comparison between your income now and potential future income expressed in today's terms.

Here are links to some more of the best that we have found:

> Aviva pension calculator

(Shows potential pot and compares drawdown and annuity)

> Money Advice Service pension calculator

(Works on your personal scenario)

> Standard Life pension calculator

(Quick and simple to use)

The key thing is to look at what your projected income will be when you reach retirement and then try to work out if this will be adequate.

However, be warned, it can be confusing and demoralising to work out how your savings today will translate into income when you retire.

The reality is that when you start saving for retirement you may not be able to pay in as much as you would like. However, it's important to remember that payments can be upped at any time and the early you start the better chance you have of building a bigger pot.

HOW MUCH WOULD 15% OF SALARY DELIVER? Aviva's pension calculator suggests a 35-year-old currently on £35,000 who saved 10 per cent of their salary with their employer adding 5 per cent for the rest of their career would build up a pot worth £283,000 by their state pension age of 68. They are forecast to get a state pension of about £8,000. If they used income drawdown for retirement they could have an income of £21,000 per year from age 68 to 94, when their pension pot would run out. After this their income would drop to the state pension. Alternatively, an annuity would deliver an income of £16,915 for the rest of their life.

Investing for retirement doesn't have to be into a pension

It makes sense to take the maximum advantage of any offer to match contributions that your employer makes.

For example, if they will match up to 5 per cent of what you put in, then putting in that maximum 5 per cent means that you make the most of your employer's scheme.

Above this level, you will still benefit from tax relief on contributions but won't get any more boost from your work scheme.

That means that because of the restrictions surrounding pension savings - primarily that you cannot access them until at least age 55 - some people choose to invest extra sums elsewhere.

So for example, you could put an extra 5 per cent of your salary into an investment Isa, where you do not get any tax relief on contributions but any income that you eventually draw from it should be tax-free.

How to balance a pension against other investments such as an Isa comes down to personal choice.

Top of the pile: The earlier you start saving for retirement, the better.

Pension essentials - the things you need to know

Defined contribution vs defined benefit

There are two main types of pension schemes - defined contribution and defined benefit schemes (also known as final salary)..

A defined contribution pension will usually allow members to decide how much of their salary they want to pay in and these payments will matched by their employers, at least up to a certain level.

The money is saved into a pension and then invested into funds with the view that it will grow over the years to deliver a retirement pot.

You are able to track the investments, measure how they are performing and change them if you wish.

However, it’s up to you to build up your pot needed for retirement, so it’s important to keep payments up once you start and reassess how much you can afford to pay in every few years.

With a defined benefit pension scheme your employer will usually pay out a certain amount of your final salary when you retire and they will take responsibility for funding that.

There are other types of defined benefit schemes, such as career-adjusted schemes where you'll be paid a proportion of your average earnings during your employment.

Different pension providers will run schemes in different ways, so it's worth checking with your provider for the full details.

However, defined benefit pension schemes have turned out to be very expensive for companies and as a result they have become rare in private businesses and are usually only offered in the public sector.

Most people with some years left to work will find themselves reliant on a defined contribution pension for a hefty chunk of their retirement income.

Types of work pension Defined contribution pension A worker agrees to pay in a set amount into their defined contribution pension scheme, say 5 per cent of their earnings. Their employer may match this, so 10 per cent of their total earnings goes into the pension each month (5% + 5%). The money is invested in stock market funds and the pot grows over the years. On retirement the saver must take their pot and buy an income with it or draw on it for one. Defined benefit pension A worker agrees to pay in a certain amount per month into their final salary pension, say 8 per cent of their earnings. In return, their employer will pay them a set chunk of their final salary for every year they have worked there, in this case one-sixtieth. Someone who has worked at the company and been a pension scheme member for 40 years would therefore retire on two-thirds of their final salary (40/60ths).

What is pension auto-enrolment about?

Many people have been paying into a pension with work for many years, but not all companies had schemes and this means millions were missing out on saving for retirement

As a result, the government tasked The Pensions Regulator with making sure that employers roll out a scheme considered vital to ensuring that people have more retirement income to top up state pension payments.

The rules mean that if you're an employee then your employer must offer you a pension scheme.

These rules if you're at least 22 years-old and employed with a salary of at least £10,000 a year.

You have the option to say ‘no’ to auto-enrolment if you don’t want to join, but if you do nothing then you’ll automatically get signed up.

By 2018 all employers by law will have to contribute to their employees’ pensions, but to start with only bigger firms had to offer this.

Over 5 million people have been auto enrolled since it started in October 2012, and less than 1 in 10 have chosen to opt out, according to government figures.

The law says a minimum percentage of your ‘qualifying earnings’ must be paid into your workplace scheme, this means either the amount you earn before tax between £5,824 and £42,385 a year, or your entire salary or wages before tax. It depends on how your employer chooses to work out qualifying earnings.

At the moment the minimum rates are low, with around 1 per cent of your salary from you and 1 per cent from your employer. That will increase to 4 per cent from you and 3 per cent from your employer by 2018.

In practice, minimum amounts may be higher for you or your employer, because of individual schemes rules.

AUTO-ENROLMENT: WHAT ARE THE MINIMUM PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS? The minimum you pay The minimum your employer pays The government pays 0.8% of your 'qualifying earnings' rising to 4% by 2018 1% of your 'qualifying earnings; rising to 3% by 2018 0.2% of your 'qualifying earnings' rising to 1% by 2018

Tax relief on contributions to your pension pot

Tax relief on contributions to your pension pots means that some of the money that would have gone as income tax goes into your pension instead.

If you pay money into a pension yourself or its taken by your employer from your pay, then you’ll automatically get 20 per cent tax relief.

For example, you’re a lower rate tax payer and you put £80 of your tax-home pay into your pension. You would have earned £100 before income tax was applied, so you would get tax relief of £20.

It gets a bit more complicated if you’re a 40 per cent higher rate tax payer as you can claim relief on the extra 20 per cent - but may have to do this yourself - while top-rate taxpayers can claim back up to their 45 per cent tax rate.

How higher rate taxpayers get their tax relief depends on their pension scheme. Some will have it automatically done for them, others will have to write to HMRC or claim it back through self-assessment. Ask your employer what you need to do.

Tax relief on pensions is limited. It is capped at 100 per cent of your earnings in a year, or by the £40,000 per year annual allowance. A £1million lifetime allowance on the size of a pension pot also applies, which includes money you pay in and what it grows too, above this it is no longer tax efficient to save into a pension.

Personal pensions

If you're self-employed or keen to boost your pension pot you can set up your own personal pension in addition - or instead of - your work pension and invest through that too.

You can opt for a simple stakeholder pension, or a more flexible self-invested personal pension, known as a Sipp.

You also get tax relief on your personal pension pot contributions, as explained above.

Don't forget about the state pension

As well as your work or personal pension, those with enough qualifying years of National Insurance payments will get a basic state pension payment provided by the Government - which is now £155.65 per week for a single person under the new flat rate system.

The state pension age is due to be increased over the next few years, you can use HMRC's state pension calculator to see when you will be eligible for it.

For a 35-year-old today, the state pension age will be 68.

Although it might not seem like a big amount it's a good foundation on which to build your retirement income.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Children as young as eight have been caught behind the wheel on UK roads in the past three-and-a-half years, shocking new figures have revealed.

The legal age for driving a car in Britain is 17, although you can apply for a provisional licence at 15 and nine months, while some quadricycles - like the quirky Renault Twizy - allow youngsters to legally hit the road at the age of 16.

A 16-year-old can also ride a moped after passing a Compulsory Basic Training course) and some mobility patients are allowed to drive cars from the same age if given special permission.

However, official records show there are some drivers half that age being pinched at the controls of cars on our roads.

Junior joyriders: Children as young as 8 years of age have been caught at the wheel of motor vehicles in Britain since 2018

New data harvested via a Freedom of the Information request to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) by Select Car Leasing revealed the shockingly young profile of joyriders caught in the act.

Latest available figures provided by the government agency stretch as far back as the start of 2018 and include stats up to 12 June 2021.

They show the number of young people under the age of 17 who have been disqualified from driving and the country in which they live.

The youngest person prosecuted in the first half of this year was an 11-year-old male in England.

But in both 2018 and 2019 there were up to five boys nicked in charge of a vehicle aged just eight.

And in 2019 there were also up to five girls of the same age disqualified.

The DVLA does not give a precise number if the figure is below five because it 'could lead to the identification of individuals'.

UK courts have the power to disqualify those legally too young to drive. Once that disqualification period has expired, the individual, on reaching the legal age to obtain a driving licence, may apply for one. For someone caught at the age of 8, it means they should have no issue getting their hands on a licence at the age of 17

The overall figures show there were far more males than females caught driving while under 17.

For both genders it was 16-year-olds, just months shy of gaining a provisional licence, who were the worst offenders.

From the start of 2018 up to 12 June this year, a whopping 6,114 males aged 16 were disqualified compared to just 192 females.

Do driving disqualifications carry over if a person is below the legal age? UK courts have the power to disqualify those legally too young to drive. A spokesman for the DVLA said: 'Non-licence holders disqualified by a court are dealt with in the same way as GB driving licence holders. 'In such cases a non-licence holder record is set up so that the offence can be recorded. 'Once the disqualification period has expired, the individual, on reaching the legal age to obtain a driving licence, may apply to do so. 'Any licence issued will show the details of any current endorsements.' That means those cases of eight-year-old drivers caught since the starts of 2018 are likely to be able to apply for a licence without issue when they turn 17 - granted they are not reprimanded at the wheel again before then.

Other troubling figures showed there were up to five 11-year-old boys disqualified in England for each of the years in question, while a staggering 48 boys aged 12 fell foul of the law for driving across the same time period.

But the good news for road safety is that the number of offenders is dropping.

There were 3,512 drivers under 17 disqualified in 2018, which increased slightly to 3,541 in 2019.

That dipped last year to 2,981, influenced by the Covid lockdown restrictions that kept people in their homes for months.

In the first half of this year there were only 259 offenders.

Graham Conway, managing director of Select Car Leasing - the man behind the submission of the FOI request - said that despite the decline the figures are 'hugely worrying for anyone who legally ventures onto the roads'.

He adds: 'Not only are these underage motorists driving without a licence, they also have no insurance and obviously a complete lack of training and practice required to safely take charge of a vehicle.

'They are therefore putting the lives of many people in danger – other drivers and passengers, plus pedestrians who could be involved in serious incidents if things go badly wrong.

'Even more worrying is the fact that this data is only for those who have been caught. There are bound to be many more underage drivers who undertake this potentially lethal pursuit and have so far escaped prosecution.'

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Steve Webb replies: Large numbers of so-called 'with-profits' policies were sold years ago, and those who still hold these old-style policies need to understand how they work and think very carefully before cashing them in.

By way of background, one of the problems with investing your money is that it can be rather volatile.

If you are investing to get a decent rate of return you are probably taking an element of investment risk which means that you will have a mix of good years and bad years.

Many people are uncomfortable with seeing the value of their investments moving up and down and would prefer something that smoothed out the peaks and troughs.

This is what 'with profits' policies are designed to do. (There are more modern policies which also attempt to smooth returns but do so in a rather different way).

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

In brief, when you put money in a with-profits pension or investment it is invested across a range of assets in the usual way. However, the return on your investment is calculated in a slightly different way.

As part of your overall return, you are awarded an 'annual bonus' which is added to the value of your policy. This is usually in two parts.

The first is a bonus which is 'locked in' – it cannot be taken away from you. This is sometimes known as a 'reversionary bonus'.

Second, you may receive an additional 'indicative' annual bonus but this is not guaranteed and can be withdrawn later if investments do less well than expected.

This variable annual bonus is designed to smooth the returns on the investment.

In a good year the bonus may be less than the actual return on the underlying investments and in a bad year it may be more than the actual return.

By smoothing in this way, the value of your policy will generally rise much more steadily than if it exactly the tracked the underlying value of the investments.

At the end of the life of the policy you then get something called a 'terminal bonus'.

During the life of the policy you may receive forecasts as to how much this will be, but those forecasts are for information only and are not guaranteed.

When you come to the end a calculation will be done and a final bonus will be added. This is the amount that you can take out.

As you can see from this simple description, 'with profits' policies are designed to be run for the full length of the policy.

The smoothing from year-to-year and the adjustment of the terminal bonus are all part of the management of the policy.

For that reason, there are often significant penalties associated with taking out your money early (sometimes referred to in paperwork as 'market value reductions'), and that appears to be the case with your two 'with profits' policies.

Deal or no deal? Deciding when to take 'with profits' benefits can be like playing the popular game show... A pension expert explains here.

Given that you have said that you don't plan to use these funds for another decade, this would be a good reason to think very carefully before you consider transferring out.

Obviously, if the investment performance has been poor and the charges are high then you might consider transferring to another more modern pension, but you should be very careful about transferring prematurely just because it feels tidier to combine your pensions in one place, especially if you would have to pay a penalty for doing so.

With profits policies can be quite complex to understand, and these days providers generally employ committees of experts whose role is to make sure that the different with profits policy holders are all being treated fairly.

There have been examples of 'with profits' policies going badly wrong (notably the very particular circumstances of the Equitable Life scandal), but other people have had good value from such products and have benefited from the way in which they smooth out the ups and downs of investing.

I would encourage you to get more information about your two policies and to ask the two different providers to give you information about how these funds have performed, how much are the charges and what would be the penalty if you did decide to move the money out now.

You should also find out if your policies have valuable features like 'guaranteed annuity rates' which could be lost if you cashed out.

But if there is no pressing need to take the money out, and if the funds are performing well, then you should be careful of moving them just on the basis of something you have been told.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the crucial Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow approaches, the questions are multiplying.

Can the Government cajole the nation to drive electric cars and embrace other energy-saving measures to stop global temperatures rising?

As for investors, a dilemma faces anyone who cares about the planet, but wants a decent return at the same time.

Recent floods and storms highlight the impact of global warming and are making more people consider investments that cut carbon dioxide emissions.

But finding a way through the haze of promises of cleaner air and higher yields is becoming tricky.

Worldwide, an estimated £31trillion is now invested in funds that have an ESG approach, prioritising the environment, sustainability and corporate governance.

The move into the area is being fuelled by concern over these issues – and the belief that change for the better could be lucrative.

Research from David Smith of Aberdeen Standard Investments reveals that companies with the highest ESG ratings have been more profitable and paid higher dividends than their lower-rated counterparts. Investors are increasingly shunning companies perceived as being out of step with the ESG agenda, which will further intensify the shift.

But it is not all plain sailing. Liontrust last month failed to reach its £100m target for the launch of a new ESG investment trust, despite the group's record of good performance. I hope that all fund managers will see this set back as a wake-up call to be more open about their objectives and how they will achieve them.

And the desire to attract cash is leading to concerns that some funds may be 'greenwashing'.

They may boast of their attachment to sustainability, but are merely box-ticking and thus misleading investors.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently warned that 'ESG assertions must be reasonable and substantiated'.

The severity of the watchdog's tone suggests fund managers would be advised to comply.

Yet even if they do moderate the greenwash hyperbole, the debate surrounding some funds' holdings will remain.

Passive funds that track the FTSE 4Good US Select index – which excludes companies in armaments, fossil fuels and tobacco – often hold shares in tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google's owner Alphabet. These groups have ambitious carbon reduction goals, meaning they score highly on some of the multiplicity of ESG metrics. About 14 different frameworks are used for stock selection.

Nick Edgerton, manager of the Stewart Investors Worldwide Sustainability fund, contends that some business practices at Amazon and the rest make them unsuitable for inclusion.

Others maintain the argument is more nuanced. Taking a stake in a company should be a route to reform, a stance advocated by fund manager Baillie Gifford.

Declining to work with a controversial business like Rio Tinto, for example, would potentially result in 'poorer mining standards, more environmental damage, and slower progress towards the low-carbon economy we all need'.

Fund managers also stress the need to take an objective look at a company's operations. Matthew Beddall of Havelock cites Kronos, a German manufacturer of plastic bottling machinery. Its products may seem to pile further threat on the fragile ecology of the planet. But Kronos can retrofit drinks companies' equipment to use recycled plastics.

The Cop26 summit, which starts on October 31, has been described as an inflection point in the progress to a net zero target.

The wish to take advantage of the transition to an ultra-low carbon economy means that I am an investor in several ESG funds and trusts, including Liontrust's Sustainable Future Global Growth. I am relaxed about tech holdings, but want to feel that my money is backing businesses bent on delivering solutions.

Mike Appleby of Liontrust says the group likes technologies that cut energy waste and so lower companies' bills: 'Take Daikin, a Japanese group which is innovating in air conditioning. They've done away with ducting and instead put much more efficient separate units in each room.'

Another holding in the Liontrust sustainable stable is the SDCL Energy Efficiency Income trust which invests in energy efficiency infrastructure projects.

At present this trust is at a 13 per cent premium to the value of its net assets, making it an expensive foray into ESG for those who trust the FCA's intervention curtails virtue signalling and encourages a new era of delivering rewards for investors.

However, Jupiter Green, another trust, is at a 9 per cent discount and gives useful exposure to renewables through Vestas, the Danish manufacturer of Wind Turbines.

Jake Moeller of fund analysts Square Mile likes the Ninety One Global Environmental fund which owns Waste Management, America's largest recycling business.

Where there is muck, may there be brass!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Since the earliest days of the pandemic, all sorts of sweeping statements have been made about how it was going to change the way we lived, for good.

Working from home would become the norm. Local high streets would flourish as city centres fell into obsolescence. And there would be a mass exodus from Britain's urban hubs to the countryside, as office workers were liberated from their daily commutes.

By and large, those predictions came true for many people, at least in Covid's darkest days.

House hunting: Finding a new place to live in South London following the pandemic 'exodus' has not been as easy as I hoped it would be, writes Helen Crane

Not for me, though. Not only am I one of the seemingly few people left who still enjoys city life, but the part of the country where my family lives - the only area I would have a reason to move to - is too far to commute to the office in London, even if it was just for one or two days a week.

But plenty of people - some of my twenty and thirty-something London friends included - have made their escape to the country.

Some of them bought homes and contributed to the housing boom of the past year, but others continued to rent.

Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent and a former RICS residential chairman, tells me: 'At the beginning of the pandemic, we found that many people moved out of cities, even circumventing the suburbs on the way, because they realised they wouldn't be commuting for a while.

'There was no need to be near the centre of activity, paying higher rents. The race for space, a place where they could work from home and enjoy a garden, were top of the wish list.'

So when I set out on my search for a large one or two-bed flat to rent in South London for myself and my partner recently, I'll admit I was feeling rather smug.

With so many people having left, I thought I would have my pick of homes to rent in areas like Brixton, Balham and Dulwich - which, pre-pandemic, were known as hotspots for young professionals and families starting out.

The days of traipsing around endless bog-standard flats, only to find that they had been snapped up by someone else while I was still grimacing at the inside of the cooker, were surely gone.

Property market experts say that renters are returning to cities now that they have been asked to come back to the office part-time, leading to an increase in demand for homes

When I moved to London a decade ago, I lived in not one but two flats with a resident rat; a house where the front door didn't lock; and another where the shower was conveniently located in a cupboard in the kitchen.

Things have improved a lot since then, but as this will hopefully be my final rented flat before I am able to buy, I thought that this was a chance to find a nicer place than ever before.

And with rents apparently declining in London, I hoped I might even be able to bag a bargain.

I'm sad to say that it has been nowhere near that simple.

A flat with 17 viewings and one with sealed bids...

Earlier this week, I viewed a one-bedroom flat in Tooting. It was in reasonably good order, but quite small and nothing special.

We ruled it out partly because the ceiling in the bathroom was too low for my 6ft 4 partner to properly stand up.

So I couldn't believe it when the agent told me that there were 17 viewings scheduled for that evening alone.

Landlords have been taking advantage of high demand by instructing agents to ask prospective tenants to go in to sealed bids, where they state the highest rent they would pay

The day before that, we had looked around a two-bed in Streatham, where the only viewing slot available was a 45-minute open house on a Tuesday afternoon.

We knew instantly it wasn't for us. The wallpaper was peeling, the bathroom looked damp and the whole place smelled like dog. We took a cursory look around and left.

A few minutes later, I received an email from the agent telling us that we had two hours to submit what was essentially a sealed bid, detailing how much over the 'asking' rent we would be willing to pay to secure the flat.

Based on other places I'd seen in the area, they were already asking for more than the place was worth - but there must have been plenty of interest for them to initiate a bidding war.

Along with a few other disappointing viewings, we also had to take around half the properties we liked off our list because they had been snapped up before we even had a chance to attend our appointment.

Feeling slightly exasperated, I decided to ask some agents why I'd been having so much trouble finding a flat.

According to Daniel Parker, lettings director at Savills, I was just too late.

Over the past month, he says demand for rented flats has been 'extraordinary' as young professionals looked to return to London, and domestic and international students getting back on campus for this academic year.

'Last year there were instances of tenants looking for a bargain but that window has well and truly passed now,' he says.

'Offices right across London are reporting cases of new launches receiving 20-plus calls from the moment they're put online, properties going within a matter of hours and tenants offering above guide to secure something.'

We also haven't helped ourselves by looking for the same type of flat, in the same location, as pretty much everyone else.

By looking for a place with space for two people to work from home and ideally a garden or terrace, we have been pitting ourselves against a wave of returning young professionals.

Larger flats are in high demand in cities, as tenants search for space to work from home

'Larger apartments with both working from home space and outside space are most sought after as post pandemic, tenants' preferences have changed,' says Chris Morris, head of lettings at Cluttons.

As well as changes in tenant's behaviour, the choices made by landlords in the last year have also dictated the type of properties that are available in Britain's inner cities.

When house prices rocketed amid the stamp duty holiday, some inner-city landlords took the opportunity to sell up - especially if their tenants had moved out or asked for rent reductions during lockdown.

Others have decided to rent their homes via AirBnb in recent years, as they can make far more money, usually with fewer tax obligations.

This is even more of a problem in the UK's coastal towns, where some renters now find it all but impossible to find a decent home.

All of this means less rented homes to choose from, driving up competition for those that are available.

The one positive we have found in our search is that rents, while not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, seem only slightly higher than they were the last time I was looking for a new flat in 2019.

In normal circumstances, I would have expected them to be substantially more - though they are clearly being driven up above the advertised price in some cases by agents asking for sealed bids.

Inner London rents are 16.5 per cent down on the same time last year, according to Hamptons - though I don't feel that they have fallen that dramatically in the areas where I am looking, on the border between inner and outer London.

In any case, they are now on the rise again. According to Hamptons, the average rent in inner London rose by 4.3 per cent in a month in June, the first monthly rise since the beginning of the pandemic and now averaging £2,103 per month.

This will be a familiar experience to tenants in other cities across the UK, where rents have continued to rise throughout pandemic.

As for us, we've now hopefully - and finally - secured a nice two-bed flat on a pretty terraced street, crossed t's and dotted i's pending.

We had to forfeit the garden flat that we initially wanted in order to find a place in a good location, with enough space for us to both work from home - but with a large park around the corner, and summer coming to an end anyway, that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Put off by pushy agents, tight deadlines and opaque 'best offer' situations, we ended up cutting out the middleman and using the website Open Rent, where potential tenants deal directly with the landlord.

No bidding war, no admin fees, and hopefully a nice home for us while we save up the last of the money we need to get out of renting for good.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@M&S Bank has launched a new rewards credit card offering its customers enhanced rewards and a range of shopping vouchers among other benefits.

M&S Club Rewards comes with a £10 monthly charge and is exclusively available to credit card holders with the retail giant.

The new membership provides a host of benefits including unlimited next day delivery for M&S online purchases, additional reward points on M&S shopping and overseas spending and a plethora of vouchers.

M&S Club Rewards benefits include free next-day online delivery on M&S.com shopping.

'This is not just a credit card – it's a "bursting with rewards" M&S credit card,' said Kirsty Ward, director of bank and services at M&S.

'Our M&S Credit Card program is unique and enjoyed by millions of customers and M&S Club Rewards offers even more for those who love M&S.

'This marks the latest step in our transformation to deliver truly rewarding payment experiences for our customers.'

What does Club Rewards offer?

To start with, membership enables customers to benefit from unlimited next day delivery for all M&S online purchases.

This will be a huge draw for many shoppers with many major UK retailers yet to offer this type of service.

At present, free standard delivery for M&S shoppers takes 3-5 working days and is usually only available for purchases over £50 - the usual charge for next day delivery is £4.99.

'The inclusion of unlimited free next day delivery will no doubt prove popular,' said Andrew Hagger, personal finance expert at MoneyComms.

'It's a key element of Amazon Prime and during the last 12 months, home delivery has been big business and is likely to remain at pre-Covid levels.'

M&S Credit Card spending in-store and abroad (3 points per £1) - thanks to number crunching from MoneyComms Monthly spend Annual reward £150 £54 £200 £72 £250 £90 £300 £108 £350 £126 £400 £144 £600 £216

On top of any M&S Bank Credit Card rewards, Club Rewards will give you an additional two points for every £1 spent with M&S.

100 reward points is worth £1 in M&S vouchers and points will be automatically converted into M&S vouchers and sent out to customers every three months.

This means shoppers will acquire three points every £1 spent with their credit card - equivalent to three per cent cashback.

When spending £300 a month on an M&S credit card you could expect to accrue £108 a year in points.

M&S Club Rewards customers can also enjoy 32 hot drinks vouchers for use in the M&S café throughout the year with no value limit per voucher.

Customers will also benefit from three points for every £1 spent abroad, which is the equivalent of the foreign exchange fee of 2.99 per cent.

M&S are currently giving customers the chance to boost these rewards even further via an introductory offer with Club Rewards membership – equivalent to four points per £1 first 12 months only.

This means during the first 12 months, a £300 monthly spend in M&S will earn you £144 over the course of the first year.

In addition to earning reward points on M&S spending and purchases abroad, M&S Club Rewards customers will also earn one point for every £5 spent outside of M&S.

Like most store brand reward credit cards, the reward for spend elsewhere is much reduced, in the case of M&S, its one point per £5 spent is the equivalent of only accruing £14.40 each year were you to spend £600 a month outside of M&S.

Furthermore, the reward card's generous array of vouchers include three £15 clothing and home vouchers, alongside a £20 clothing and home voucher to use at Christmas, plus a £12 M&S food voucher to buy a birthday meal or treat.

Customers will also be able to enjoy 32 hot drinks vouchers for use in the M&S café throughout the year – with no value limit per voucher.

How do the vouchers work?

None of the vouchers are transferable so you will not be able to exchange them for cash or resell them to someone else.

The birthday treat voucher worth £12, is specifically for the cardholder to spend on food or drink treats and can be used in food halls and M&S cafes - once issued the voucher will only be valid for five weeks.

There is no minimum spend on the Christmas £20 Clothing and Home voucher.

However, the voucher can only be used once and partial refunds for any unused amount are not permitted.

When using the voucher, for any part payment transactions, the balance should be paid using the M&S card on the account.

The 32 Hot drink vouchers have a three-month expiry to be aware of and likewise for any part payment transactions, the balance should be paid using the M&S card on the account.

There is no cap on the vouchers and coffee prices in M&S Café ranges from £1.75 to £3.

Customers have the option to add unlimited extra shots of coffee for 50p each, syrups for 50p each and also switch to a Colombian blend of coffee for an extra 20p.

The £15 home and clothing voucher will come available throughout the year – once in spring, summer and autumn.

How does it compare?

When compared to other rewards cards, the M&S club rewards membership fares very well.

It's closest competitor is the £7.99 a month Tesco Clubcard Plus, which offers five points per £4 spent on top of 10 per cent off your groceries in-store, twice a month.

Tesco Clubcard Plus customer can expect to see an annual reward benefits of £129.12 for every £300 spent, according to number crunching by MoneyComms.

The net benefit for a M&S credit card customer with Club Rewards membership is £153 for £300 of monthly in-store spending.

The Tesco Clubcard Plus has a £7.99 monthly charge and offers five points per £4 spent in Tesco Store plus 10 per cent off 2 shops per month.

But as with all rewards customers, much will depend on how much you spend and whether you fully take advantage of all the perks.

'For M&S spending of up to £350 per month with any of the M&S Credit Cards – or up to £400 in the first 12 months if customers take out the M&S Credit Card Rewards Offer - it's the most rewarding offer on the market,' said Hagger.

'For higher monthly spending, Tesco Clubcard Plus comes out on top due to the 10 per cent rebate on your two biggest food shop bills each month.

'The Tesco offering costs £7.99 per month and like M&S offers several but different 'same brand' benefits such as double data on mobile phones and 10 per cent in store Tesco ranges of clothes and cookware.'

Verdict?

Although the £10 monthly fee may have some people turning their noses up at this new offering by M&S, ignoring all other benefits, it is still possible to more than offset that cost using the vouchers alone.

MoneyComms has calculated that after using all the vouchers, customers should still see a net benefit of about £45 each year.

Then there is also the reward points to be accrued from in-store spending, which could amount to as much £189 in the first year were you to spend £300 on average each month in M&S.

The unlimited free next day delivery is also not to be sniffed at either.

With no minimum spend on M&S purchases, this could save Club Rewards members a further £4.99 each time they order online compared to other M&S shoppers.

'Its components are different from other store brand offerings,' said Hagger.

'This is a unique and financially worthwhile product for M&S shoppers, with larger spenders being rewarded with increased reward vouchers on top of the core benefits,'

'The days of over-arching rewards or cashback programmes that reward you handsomely wherever you shop are a thing of the past.

'But as far as store branded reward offers go, this is an added value package that delivers and for M&S shoppers it is worth a closer look.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Advertisement

Supercar maker Bugatti has turned a one-off experimental prototype into an extreme £4.1million limited edition hypercar for the track.

Unveiled as part of the by-invitation-only Pebble Beach car extravaganza in California, and shown at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, only 40 examples of the new Bugatti Bolide will be built, with first deliveries from 2024.

The Bolide name itself comes from a French slang term that roughly translates as: 'It's a fast car.''

'Unbelievably fast': But the 40 Bolides will be for track use only and not road-legal

Described by Bugatti as 'extreme, light, and unbelievably fast', each one will cost around £4.1million, the equivalent of its European price tag of €4.8million - made up of a basic €4million plus 20 per cent tax.

A blast with the extras list could see even that stratospheric price climb as fast as the car accelerates.

The 40 Bolides will be for track use only and not road-legal. They are designed to stick to the tarmac like glue thanks to massive downforce generated by the aerodynamic design.

The new Bolide is powered by a vast 8.0-litre 1,600 horse-power W16 petrol engine. Although no exact performance figures have been released, it is expected to accelerate from rest to 62mph in under 3 seconds and go up to a top speed well over 200mph.

The car firm will likely attempt to beat the figures of the current fastest Bugatti Chiron Supersport, costing €3.2million, which accelerates to 62mph in under 3 seconds, to 124mph in 5.5 seconds, and goes up to a top speed of around 273mph (440km/hr).

Bugatti will likely attempt to beat the figures of the current fastest Bugatti Chiron Supersport

The firm said the emphasis was on the car's downforce giving it exceptional holding ability on the track noting: 'This will make the Bolide the most extreme configuration level of the legendary 8.0-litre W16 engine and a must-have for Bugatti collectors.'

Lightweight materials give the production version a kerb weight of just 1,450 kilograms and therefore a weight-to-power ratio of 0.9 kilograms per horsepower.

The French carmaker, with its boutique factory at Molsheim near the Rhine and just across the river from the border with Germany added: 'The new hyper sports car will be taken to production maturity over the next three years, with its delivery scheduled for 2024 at a and limited to 40 units.'

Bugatti first unveiled a prototype version of the Bolide as a one-of-a-kind experimental vehicle in October 2020. Now work on the production version has begun.

Lightweight materials give the production version a kerb weight of just 1,450 kilograms

The car firm said: 'When Bugatti presented its Bolide technological concept in autumn 2020, it was initially a drivable experimental vehicle - a one-off.'

It added that the final production car is 'raw and authentic' and 'the ultimate driving machine and the quintessence of power, lightness, and acceleration.'

The Bugatti team said the Bolide was born of an idea and a question: 'What if Bugatti built a radically light vehicle around the legendary 8.0-litre W16 engine? '

It noted: 'The upshot was the experimental study of the Bugatti Bolide as a racetrack-oriented hyper sports car with a production-based W16 engine and minimal bodywork designed with maximum downforce in mind. Presenting this engine in its purest form is the quintessence of the Bolide.'

They added: 'With the highly limited-edition production Bolide, Bugatti engineers and designers have created the most extreme vehicle concept ever to have been conceived around the powerful power train of the W16 engine with four turbochargers, offering the promise of the ultimate Bugatti performance kick.'

Bugatti says design of the Bolide follows a minimalist approach of 'form follows performance'

Bolide sits very low to the ground, with an air intake scoop on the roof and an ultra-sporty seat

The production version has 1600PS because Bugatti opted for 98 RON petrol

Bugatti says design of the Bolide follows a minimalist approach of 'form follows performance' and uncompromising lightweight construction.

It said: 'It pays homage to the brand's glorious motorsport past of the in the 1920s. The numerous air ducts and delicate front end are more reminiscent of aerodynamically sophisticated Formula 1 cars than a hyper sports car, and they dominate its look. '

The new hypercar sits very low to the ground, with an air intake scoop on the roof and an ultra-sporty seat position.

Explaining how the hypercar sticks to the track, Bugatti said: 'In combination with the striking rear diffuser, the dominant rear wing results in high downforce and therefore also optimum traction.'

Each car has a split of colours, but 'the proportion of visible carbon parts is greater than in other models'.

The original Bolide experimental vehicle had 1,850 PS but this was achieved among other things thanks to 110-octane racing fuel.

The production version has 1600PS because Bugatti opted for 98 RON petrol, which is available worldwide 'so that the owners can use their vehicles around the world without any issues'.

Bugatti's designers and engineers are currently honing the aerodynamics and handling

To ensure safety standards in line with FIA race rules, Bugatti's designers and engineers are currently honing the aerodynamics and handling.

To help guarantee maximum safety and sufficient comfort Bugatti has also developed an array of new components, an automatic fire extinguishing system, pressure refuelling with a fuel bladder, central wheel locking, a six-point safety belt, and compatibility with a 'HANS' system designed when worn with a helmet to protect the neck, head and upper torso.

Bugatti president Stephan Winkelmann said: 'The Bolide generated a great deal of enthusiasm and intrigue last year. Following its presentation, a significant number of enthusiasts and collectors asked us to develop the experimental Bolide as a production vehicle. I was absolutely amazed by the reactions and feedback from customers from all over the world.'

Each car has a split of colours, but 'the proportion of visible carbon parts is greater than in other models'

As a result he said: 'We therefore decided to make the Bolide a few-off in order to give 40 customers the opportunity to experience this incredible vehicle. Our team has now been developing a production model - the ultimate driving machine for the track.'

Winkelmann added: 'The customers' safety is always our top priority. We therefore decided to offer exclusive track days for this extreme vehicle in order to guarantee a safe environment at all times and gradually introduce the customers to the Bolide's breath-taking performance.

'We are proud to have succeeded in keeping the production vehicle so close to its technical demonstrator both visually and technically while also enhancing the design, quality, and vehicle safety.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Often the treatment of cancer is a high wire act for a physician, who has to administer the optimal dose to kill off the disease while ensuring the already sick patient doesn't feel the full force of the toxic side-effects.

Targeted drugs that take out the cancer cell, leaving healthy cells intact, would largely resolve this issue.

However, this precision approach comes with a massive challenge – and one that has largely stumped scientists for the last three decades.

Bivictrix's treatments target cancer with superior specificity, eradicating collateral damage

'There's actually a lack of cancer-specific targets on the surface of a cancer cell. Those you do find you'd also see on a healthy cell,' explains Tiffany Thorn, chief executive of BiVictriX.

'So, whilst using antibodies to target cancer cells is a good idea in principle, we've not really been able to unlock the full potential of these selective therapeutics in a way we thought was possible 30 years ago, because there's nothing selective on the cancer cells to actually target.'

Well, until now. Thorn is the inventor of an approach that leans heavily on her experience working in the NHS identifying cancer rather than treating it.

Spotting the signs of the disease meant looking for specific patterns on the surface of a cell (rather than a single cancer identifier); a fingerprint for cancer if you will.

Thorn and her team have taken the idea and exploited it for the first time in a therapeutic setting to generate Bi-Cygni treatments, which target the cancer with superior specificity, eradicating collateral damage.

The benefits, though yet to be fully proven at this early stage in process, should deliver what the experts call a 'highly selective' approach to tackling the illness.

What does that mean in practice? Well, all things being equal it should allow doctors to safely administer higher drug doses more effectively without the nasty, life-threatening side effects.

'The novelty of the company is twofold,' says Thorn.

'The first thing is we've identified cancer-specific fingerprints that we have access to and nobody else is working on them.

'So, they're unique to the company. We can differentiate healthy from diseased cells.

'The second thing is we develop drugs that only target those antigen fingerprints that we've identified.

'And those drugs are different to anything else that's currently in development because they only recognise these unique cancer cell fingerprints.'

The company's first cab off the rank is a BVX001, which binds an existing antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, to the company's 'fingerprint' technology to be selective for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

Thorn admits AML is a 'crowded' area for R&D, but one that has yielded precious few breakthroughs for an illness with an extremely poor prognosis (the five-year survival rate in over-65s is 5 per cent). The issue, as expounded at length above, is toxicity.

'It's a bold start,' Thorn says of the decision to develop a new treatment option for AML.

'But, if we can show that we can develop one of these therapeutics that is more selective in this disease indication, it shows the industry that actually there's a real benefit of this approach; because we will have gone for one of the hardest-to-treat cancers.'

Bivictrix recently listed on the London stock market, fundraising a net £6.7m

The big news recently has been the company's stock market float (the shares currently are 23.5p) a process that has brought in a net £6.7million of new funds, which equates to a cash runway of two years.

A good chunk of that new money will be put to work developing BVX001, which is likely to make it into the clinic within the next few years. It will also be deployed to expand the early-stage pipeline, and invested in patent protection of that pipeline.

Thorn, who at 33 must be one of the market's youngest chief executives, is supported by a highly experience boardroom team.

BiVictriX is chaired by Iain Ross, a veteran of the sector, who is supported by Professor Bob Hawkins, Susan Lowther and Drummond Paris.

They bring with them public markets know-how, technical expertise, financial knowledge and a deep understand of the ecosystem in which BiVictriX operates. 'I'm confident we will work well going forward,' says Thorn.

Looking ahead, the company will be making 'some key announcements' around new additions to the pipeline including an application for solid tumours.

'We'll also be filing a number of patents on both the lead molecule, and the pipeline as well,' adds Thorn.

Crucially, BiVictriX will be looking to produce data that shows the clear benefits of its technology versus an already established ADC drug on the market for AML.

'We are hoping to show that our drug outperforms both on safety and efficacy,' Thorn says.

This would then provide the support to take the discovery into clinical trials. After that it's the arduous process of testing BVX001 in humans. That said, success could transform the landscape for cancer treatment, making life easier for patient and doctor alike.

That’s cheap money – and while these super low rates are only reserved for those with the biggest deposits, it’s clear that the mortgage price war is back on.

The question is will rates keep falling and get cheaper still?

Some experts say believe they won’t and this is the floor but others suggest they could come even down all the way to 0.5 per cent.

My GP prescribed solifenacin which I've taken daily. But over the past year, the problem has returned and I now empty my bladder just as frequently as before. Have I become immune to the medication?

Problems with urinating are no joke – they can really disrupt a person's quality of life, often bringing constant worry about finding a toilet when out and about. If a patient is going frequently, is struck by a sense of urgency and is getting up to go to the toilet in the night, and suffers pain, it is likely to be due to a lower urinary tract infection.

If doctors suspect this, we first treat the symptoms, usually with a course of antibiotics. But if the symptoms don't go away, we investigate potential underlying problems.

Problems with urinating are no joke – they can really disrupt a person's quality of life, often bringing constant worry about finding a toilet when out and about, writes DR ELLIE CANNON

It's time to debunk this 'too posh to push' myth There's a poisonous term that's sometimes levelled at mothers: too posh to push. It drives me wild. It's levelled at women who've elected to give birth by caesarean section – as one in four do. The majority do so on medical advice, as a vaginal birth might risk the health, and even life, of mother and baby. A minority are simply too frightened. But 'too posh to push' panders to the idea that there are scores of women out there who simply can't be bothered to go through labour, and want a quick fix. In more than two decades as a GP, I've never come across a real-life example of this. And the idea that a natural birth is preferable is frankly dangerous. Really, it's no one's business why women choose to give birth the way they do – and neither method is better than the other. Where does this pressure come from? Not doctors, surely. I'd like to know what you think. Write to me. Advertisement

In men, the root cause of these symptoms can be related to the prostate gland. It is common for the gland to become enlarged in older age, which affects the flow of urine leaving the body.

But in your case, as a woman, the cause is more likely to be a bladder problem, which can be menopause-related or due to pelvic-floor weakness after childbirth.

Another potential cause is an overactive bladder, which is thought to affect roughly 12 per cent of the adult population, women and men. It is often worse in people with anxiety disorders and neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis.

People with an overactive bladder need to urinate very frequently, including overnight, and cannot resist the urge to go.

These conditions also render patients more susceptible to urinary tract infections, making the symptoms far worse and longer-lasting.

Avoiding all caffeine, fizzy drinks, sweetener, alcohol and citrus fruit juice can help.

Try water, milk and herbal teas – they shouldn't aggravate the problem because they don't irritate the bladder. Try not to drink much in the four hours before you go to bed. Tomatoes and spicy food should also be avoided. A programme that involves sticking to strict toilet times – called bladder training –can help to control the bladder muscles, but it can take three months to work.

Medicines are also available. Solifenacin is one example. If this doesn't work, others such as oxybutynin and tolterodine can help. A urologist may offer more invasive treatments – such as Botox to relax the bladder muscles.

I drank more alcohol than I usually would over lockdown, but have since reduced my intake. Three months ago a blood test showed problems with my liver function. The doctor suggested I drink less – but I'd barely touched it for a month before the test. What's going on? I am 69 and also take a daily statin.

The most common reasons for a high level of enzymes in the liver are a recent virus such as the flu, fatty liver disease, side effects of medications such as statins, and alcohol

Who’s double-jabbed… and shielding? I received a startling letter from a reader who told me that his GP advised him to shield again – despite the fact he's double-jabbed. He has blood cancer, which affects his immune system and means he is one of the ten per cent of people who might not respond so well to the vaccine. But I was surprised to hear that both his GP and an adviser from Public Health England told him he would be safest if he 'didn't leave the house much'. So he is relying on family to bring him vital supplies such as food and medicines. This seems like extreme advice and I worry about the effect on his mental health, given the emotional strain on shielders during the lockdowns. I'm interested to know if others have been advised to do the same. Have you been told to shield? Write to me. Advertisement

Liver function tests look at enzymes in the liver. If the level of these enzymes is unusually high, it indicates a problem.

The most common reasons are a recent virus such as the flu, fatty liver disease, side effects of medications such as statins, and alcohol.

Usually chatting to the patient gives us an idea of what the cause could be. But doctors can also order more detailed tests to investigate further, and a blood test looking for a compound called GGT will identify alcohol-related liver issues.

A GP may also consider reducing the dose of a statin. In any case, it's important that a doctor repeats tests over a period of time to see if they get the same picture. Sometimes, abnormal liver tests revert to normal straight away. Usually this is due to a transient virus, and the patient needn't worry about any long-lasting problems.

I've struggled with feeling exhausted and nauseous ever since having my second Covid jab back in April. My blood tests are all healthy. Can you help?

I wholeheartedly support the Covid vaccine but I still think it is important we acknowledge side effects when they are reported.

Nausea is actually a very common one. About one person in ten is affected. Given the number of people we have now vaccinated against Covid this year, a lot of people will experience it. But it wouldn't be the norm for the symptoms to continue for months on end.

Feeling nauseous and tired could well have been the result of the virus itself, which you might have picked up between jabs, as feeling sick is a recognised symptom of long Covid.

But it can also be caused by ongoing anxiety, medications, acid reflux and even certain cancers such as pancreatic cancer.

And lots of ongoing bowel conditions cause nausea, such as irritable bowel syndrome and a stomach infection called helicobacter.

If the nausea has continued over a few months, I'd definitely recommend booking a GP appointment to investigate potential causes thoroughly.

I'd encourage anyone who experiences symptoms they believe are linked to their vaccine to log them with the Government's yellow card scheme, which keeps a record of reported problems to keep patients safe.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@She's the golden girl of Australian television with seven Logies under her belt thanks to starring roles in award-winning homegrown dramas such as Love My Way and Offspring.

And while Asher Keddie has been on TV screens for over 35 years, she's finally got her big Hollywood break at the age of 47 in the highly-anticipated Amazon series, Nine Perfect Strangers.

Asher stars in the drama alongside Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy and Luke Evans.

Better late than never: Asher Keddie has got her Hollywood big break at the age of 47 in Nine Perfect Strangers with Nicole Kidman

It is her very first Hollywood role, aside from a small appearance in the blockbuster movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

When asked if the series, which is based on Liane Moriarty's book of the same title, is a launching pad for a glittering Hollywood career, Asher, who shares a son and stepson with her artist husband Vincent Fantauzzo, said she wouldn't rule it out.

'I would like to work anywhere, whether it is the US, the UK, Canada, or Europe,' she said in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald over the weekend.

'What I’m hoping for is that the next 10 years feels really rich in terms of work and life and that’s me being able to travel again, like all of us. For my children to be able to explore the world. For it not to feel small.'

All-star cast: Asher plays the role of Heather in Nine Perfect Strangers. She is pictured here alongside Regina Hall

Storyline: Nine Perfect Strangers follows nine desperate souls in search of healing at a retreat led by wellness guru Kidman, who leads a particularly grueling course

Asher plays the role of Heather in the drama, which was shot in Byron Bay over six months.

Nine Perfect Strangers follows nine desperate souls in search of healing at a retreat led by wellness guru Kidman, who leads a particularly grueling course.

The show comes from the creators behind The Undoing and Big Little Lies, which is based on Moriarty's books.

Acclaimed: Asher received wide recognition for her role in the critically acclaimed show Offspring, where she played Dr Nina Proudman

With strict rules around filming during the pandemic, she was separated from husband Vincent and her 12-year-old stepson Luca for months.

'It was not possible to just jump on a plane back and forth like I normally would,” she told the SMH.

'But if good work is there, like Nine Perfect Strangers, I’m not going to go, "No, it’s all too hard." I’m supporting a family here and that’s my job.'

Asher was lucky to have the couple's six-year-old son Valentino with her during filming and enrolled him in a local school in Byron Bay for a few months.

Superstar: Asher won the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress five times in a row between 2011 and 2015, and the Gold Logie award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television for her role of Dr Nina Proudman in Offspring

The acclaimed actress has been acting since she was 11, first appearing in western television drama series Five Mile Creek, which also starred Kidman.

She went on to star in several Australian TV series and movies, but received wide recognition for her roles in the critically acclaimed shows Love My Way and Offspring.

Asher won the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress five times in a row between 2011 and 2015, and the Gold Logie award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television for her role of Dr Nina Proudman in Offspring.

Lovers: Asher is married to artist Vincent Fantauzzo

Family: She is also a mother to her six-year-old son Valentino and stepson Luca, 12

Meanwhile, a new trailer for Nine Perfect Strangers was released last week via Good Morning America.

In the trailer, guests including Frances Welty, played by Melissa McCarthy, are seen going increasingly mad at the hands of Kidman's character Masha and it's apparent that there's something sinister brewing.

The nearly three-minute trailer opens with McCarthy getting a vague rundown about the 10-day retreat, which is set in a very secluded wooded area.

Hoping to become the '2.0' version of herself she embarks on a journey along with eight other strangers including Regina Hall (Girls Trip), Samara Weaving (Ready Or Not), Bobby Cannavale (Thunder Force) and Evans (Beauty And The Beast).

'Apparently I'm in need of some fixing,' Melissa's voice says as she gears up for what is sure to be a very unforgettable stay.

First look: The official trailer for the Nicole Kidman led series Nine Perfect Strangers was released last Thursday ahead of its August 18 premiere

Desperate: The drama follows nine desperate strangers who seek help from a wellness guru Kidman at a retreat before things take a turn

Secluded: The 10-day retreat takes place at a destination called Tranquillum House run by Kidman's character Masha

Final attempt: The guests seemed to have exhausted all possibilities which leads them to the retreat

Healer: 'When people come here, they come to heal,' her character's Masha voice entices

The group is quickly introduced to cult-like healer Kidman who welcomes them to Tranquillum House in a billowy white dress.

'When people come here, they come to heal,' her character's Masha voice entices.

And the trailer continues to foreshadow some extreme measures that will be taken. 'I don't want to suffer,' McCarthy says, to which Masha replies 'You're already suffering.'

McCarthy seems more open to embrace the experience than others including Evans who calls wellness retreats 'bullsh**t' and Cannavale's character who begrudgingly says 'lets go meditate.'

Meditation: The wellness guru puts them through a rigorous 10-day experience to unpack trauma

2.0: All the participants are hoping to get rid of personal demons caused by traumatic events in their life

Under her spell: Cannavale's character is resistant to the retreat but Masha quickly gets her claws into him

Pushed to the edge: 'Is Masha bats**t, or is she the real deal?,' her character asks at one point

One sequence shows the nine guests laying in graves they dug for themselves before dirt is shoveled over them, as Masha beckons 'surrender yourself to me.'

It quickly comes to be revealed that the group was hand selected — not of their own free will — as Evans character (who seems to know more than he's letting on) says they all 'compliment each other's demons.'

Adding a comedic flare McCarthy says that the whole thing could end up being a 'real s**t show' before things quickly get out of control. Cannavale says Kidman needed people that were so desperate they would try 'anything' that she wanted.

'This is a particularly volatile group — lets start the protocol,' Kidman menacingly says as she seems to pick up on the group's resistance to follow her lead.

The limited series — which streams August 18 — also stars Michael Shannon (Boardwalk Empire), Tiffany Boone (Hunters), Manny Jacinto (The Good Place), Melvin Gregg (American Vandal), and Grace Van Patten (Maniac).

Nine Perfect Strangers is launching on Prime Video in the UK on August 20 and Hulu in the US.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Housebuilder Bellway has seen its revenue rise by 41 per cent to over £3.1billion in the past year, after benefiting from surging demand from buyers looking for new homes.

House price inflation has benefited companies like Bellway, which saw the average price tag for its homes rise by 4.4 per cent to over £306,000 in the last 12 months.

Bellway also revealed it snapped up a record number of plots of land in the past year, totalling 19,819, against 12,124 plots last year and 13,284 plots back in 2019.

Surge: Housebuilder Bellway has seen its revenue rise by 41% to over £3.1bn in the past year

The group insisted it was undertaking a 'front-footed, yet disciplined' approach to buying land, aiming to focus its efforts in 'desirable locations.'

It added: 'The pricing environment remains positive, with house price inflation, which is benefitting selected sites in localities where demand is particularly strong, generally offsetting build cost pressures.'

Bellway hailed 'good underlying demand' across the country, with a private reservation rate of 169 per week, up from 141 in 2020 and 160 in 2019.

The group completed 10,138 homes in the past year, up from 7,522 last year, when lockdowns affected its operations.

Bellway said it had 'record' forward sales on its books, comprising 7,082 homes, with a value of just over £2billion, up from 6,588 homes last year.

The company said: 'There remain manageable short-term constraints in the supply chain and intermittent labour shortages across the sector as colleagues, subcontractors and suppliers are subject to self-isolation requirements to curtail the spread of Covid-19.'

Jason Honeyman, the group's chief executive, said: 'Bellway has delivered a strong performance, with volume output once again above 10,000 homes and housing revenue approaching 2019 levels.

'This positive recovery has been achieved through the hard work and dedication of our colleagues, subcontractors, and supply chain partners, while maintaining the high quality of our product and making further improvements in the service we offer our customers.

'Going forward, we are in an excellent position to continue our long-term growth strategy.

'The Group benefits from a substantial order book and a robust balance sheet. In addition, our record investment in land and the resultant strengthened land bank provides a strong platform for both volume growth and further margin recovery in the years ahead.'

Buyer interest: Bellway hailed 'good underlying demand' across the country, with a private reservation rate of 169 per week

Following the Grenfell fire, Bellway has set aside £131.6million since 2017 in relation to fire safety. It said today: 'Bellway continues to actively pursue recoveries from suppliers, subcontractors, and professional advisors where they have fallen short of the standards required.'

Bellway will publish its preliminary annual results on 19 October.

Shares in FTSE 250-listed Bellway are down 0.66 per cent or 22.00p to 3,288.00p at present. A year ago the company's share price was 2,565.00p, meaning it has risen by around 28 per cent in the past year.

Speaking to This is Money, Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: 'There’s a lot to like in Bellway Homes latest results particularly when it comes to forward sales. The heat in the housing market shows no signs of abating something the housebuilder says its ready to capitalise on.

'Issues with rising material costs are being swallowed by customers in a market where demand is still outstripping supply. There is one note of caution when it comes to supply with Bellway experiencing sector wide issues of material and labour shortages. It says they’re manageable, but close attention needs to be paid to how quickly those issues disappear or whether they’ll hang around into next year.'

Many housebuilders have seen a major spike in demand from buyers over the past year. Last week, Taylor Wimpey, one of Britain's biggest housebuilders, revealed it had returned to profit and upgraded its earnings targets after building a record number of homes in the first six months of the year.

The High Wycombe-based company built more than 7,300 homes in the first half of 2021, almost all of which have been pre-sold, allowing the company to lock in the benefit of soaring house prices triggered by cheap loans, the Government’s stamp duty holiday and a pandemic-driven preference for bigger houses.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Becoming a buy-to-let landlord can mean reaping a decent return, but it will also add to your tax bill.

If you can find a property in a decent location with good tenants then then you should be able to build up a good income from rent.

But the taxman will want to know about any returns you make. If you don't declare your income properly or capital gains when you sell, you could be in trouble.

We run through the taxes associated with buy-to-let.

Some of these taxes and allowances have changed, so make sure you are up-to-date with them.

Becoming a buy-to-let landlord can make you a good return, but it will also add to your tax bill

The taxman and buy-to-let

The taxman has taken a greater interest in people renting our homes in recent years.

To purchase a buy-to-let you need a different type of mortgage to the type you would get for your own home.

Lenders will also want to know if you have begun renting out your existing home because this is usually not allowed under the terms and conditions of a residential mortgage. Often you will have to move to a buy-to-let rate, or get permission to let.

Most banks and building societies offer buy-to-let mortgages. The rates tend to be higher than residential mortgages, which reflects risks such as tenants not paying rent and you defaulting.

Buy-to-let is treated as an investment so is subject to income tax on rent and capital gains tax on sale. You will also have to pay stamp duty on the property purchase.

Inevitably there will be those who think they can get away with dodging some of the taxes levied on buy-to-let. In the past some have, but the taxman has cracked down very heavily on this in recent years - actively making landlords a target.

At the same time, mortgage lenders have also cracked down on those letting property but staying on a residential mortgage.

You are far more likely to get caught out if you try to skip tax today.

Stamp duty

The first tax you will need to pay if you are purchasing a property to start a buy-to-let portfolio is stamp duty when you purchase a property, just as you do with a residential home.

The bad news is that stamp duty has been increased in recent years for buy-to-let and second homes. A change arrived in April 2016 that added a 3 per cent surcharge to all the stamp duty bands - in some cases this trebles the bill.

The good news is that the first £500,000 of the purchase price is currently exempt under the rules of Treasury's stamp duty cut.

Is this a buy-to-let or second home? (Higher rates apply)

Stamp duty charge

So while they will still have to pay the 3 per cent surcharge, landlords will now see their stamp duty bill significantly reduced when purchasing new property thanks to the Chancellor's measures.

While many home buyers particularly in the South East and London will undoubtedly benefit, the average landlord purchase will also see big savings.

For example as illustrated in the chart below a £400,000 second home will now only carry a stamp duty bill of £12,000 rather than £22,000.

While this is still £12,000 more than a residential purchase due to the 3 per cent surcharge, the landlord will still now save £10,000, the same as a standard home buyer would by not paying any tax at all.

This relief will be in place until 31 March of next year.

You can claim back some stamp duty by offsetting it against any capital gains tax liability when you sell.

Tax on rent

A recent change landlords will still be feeling is the replacement of mortgage interest tax relief with a 20 per cent credit.

In the past, private residential landlords with a mortgage on their buy-to-let property could simply deduct their mortgage interest from rental income before calculating tax.

This all changed in April 2017 when a new regime was brought to phase out this relief, replacing it eventually with a 20 per cent tax credit and calculation that means most landlords will pay more in income tax.

The change largely affects landlords paying higher rate tax, who will now pay tax on rental income based on revenue rather than their profit after mortgage interest is paid.

It can also affect basic rate taxpayers, who may find themselves pulled up a tax band by the way the calculation is done.

For example, under the old system a basic rate tax paying landlord with a salary of £25,000, rental income of £15,000 from their buy-to-let property and mortgage interest payments of £10,000 would have been able to subtract those interest payments from the rental income, bringing the taxable amount down to £5,000.

Added to their salary their taxable income would have been £30,000. Once the personal allowance of £12,500 has been subtracted, this would bring their total taxable income down to £17,500.

Overall, on this amount of taxable income a basic rate taxpayer would have paid a total of £3,500 in tax.

This has all changed now that the new fiscal regime has been brought in.

From now on, landlords will get no deduction for their interest cost and just a 20 per cent credit on the whole amount.

Very little changes for our previous example of a basic rate tax paying landlord with a salary of £25,000, rental income of £15,000 and mortgage interest payments of £10,000.

Under the new regime, they would be paying tax on the full £15,000 rental income. They would also get the 20 per cent tax credit on their interest payments worth £2,000.

With a salary of £25,000, our landlord's taxable income would now be £40,000.

Take away the £12,500 personal allowance and you get the final taxable income of £27,500, 20 per cent of which is £5,500.

With the tax credit this is reduced to £3,500, the same amount as before.

But higher and additional rate tax payers will almost certainly end up paying more - and as rental income is now added to income before the tax credit is used, it can push people up a tax bracket.

The example below shows how the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief would affect a 40 per cent tax payer with £3,000 taxable income:

How has mortgage interest tax relief been phased out? Current 40% tax payer Old System New System Buy to Let Tax Bill Net Profit 16/17 100% 0% £1,200 £1,800 17/18 75% 25% £1,450 £1,550 18/19 50% 50% £1,700 £1,300 19/20 25% 75% £1,950 £1,050 20/21 0% 100% £2,200 £800 Example on rental income of £10,000, mortgage of £5,000 and costs of £2,000.

Capital gains tax

When you come to sell your buy-to-let property, there will be capital gains tax to pay on any profit.

It applies to any property which is not your main home, known as your Principal Private Residence. This gets a special exemption.

On property sales CGT is levied at 18 per cent or 28 per cent depending on whether people are basic rate or higher rate taxpayers.

However, gains are added to income to deliver a total amount that decides this. This means that in practice most landlords making decent profits should pay the 28 per cent rate.

If you only have one property and it is considered your principal home, then you do not have to pay CGT, however, the taxman may want evidence that you were actually living there.

There are two reliefs you can get on your CGT bill, but they are both less generous than they once were.

Landlords who used to live in their rental properties saw certain reliefs taken away this year

Private residence relief

Along with the scrapping of mortgage interest tax relief, a new capital gains tax regime has been brought in for 'accidental' landlords.

These are landlords who once lived in a property before going on to let it out.

If a landlord rents out a property that was once their main home, capital gains tax only applies on the amount the home went up in value while they weren't living there.

Previously landlords could also add an extra 18 months onto the amount of time they lived at the property - this is known as the 'final period exemption'.

But as of this tax year that has now been reduced to nine months.

As an example of how this works, under the old rules a landlord who has owned their property for 10 years and lived in it for two would only be taxed on six-and-a-half years of capital gains – the 10 year period minus the two years of residency and the added 18 months' relief.

But now they'll be taxed on seven years and three months of capital gains – the 10 years, minus the two years residency plus the reduced nine months' relief.

Lettings relief

'Lettings relief' has also been rolled back this year.

Previously, when a landlord sold their former home after renting it out, up to £40,000 of their gain can be exempted from capital gains tax.

Couples could benefit from an exemption of up to £80,000.

Under the new rules however only landlords who live in the property with their tenants now qualify for this benefit.

Offsetting stamp duty and estate agent's fees

Have a buy-to-let tax question? Taxes for landlords have changed dramatically in recent years. This guide is regularly updated to keep you informed on the current rules. If you have any questions on buy-to-let tax that you can't find answered here, get in touch at editor@thisismoney.co.uk

You can reduce your CGT bill by deducting some of the expenses associated with buying and managing a property.

You can offset costs such as the stamp duty paid when you purchased the property as well as solicitors’ fees, estate agent’s fees to market the property, and surveyors' fees if a survey was carried out when you purchased the property.

You may also be able to offset losses on other property against your capital gains tax bill.

Inheritance tax

When you die any buy-to-lets will form part of your estate.

There may be a tax charge to pay of 40 per cent if the total estate exceeds £325,000 or £650,000 for married couples.

There are ways to reduce your inheritance tax liability by making gifts to relatives and putting bits of your estate in trust. This is much more complex with a property than it is with cash, shares or funds, which can be passed over in small chunks.

From this year each individual is offered a 'family home allowance' of £175,000, so they can pass their home on to their children or grandchildren tax-free after their death. The family home allowance is added to the existing £325,000 Inheritance Tax threshold.

This allowance does not apply to buy-to-let properties.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Driving around Menorca for two weeks is an annual tradition for Natalie Ward and her family. But they have had to change their plans for the first time in 12 years due to the staggering cost of holiday car hire.

The family of four usually pay between £60 and £350 to rent a car during their trip. But this July, the cheapest deal they found was more than three times that, at £1,200 for a fortnight.

That is more than the price of an all-inclusive holiday to Menorca in August, where a two-week stay at the Globales Apartments Binimar, Cala'n Blanes, with flights from Stansted, costs from £710 per person, according to Travelsupermarket.

The eye-watering car hire prices are yet another blow to holidaymakers who already face costly bills for Covid tests

The eye-watering car hire prices are yet another blow to holidaymakers who already face costly bills for Covid tests. And it means increasing numbers of families desperate for a sunny break are finding themselves priced out of a foreign trip.

At a glance, holiday and flight prices may seem to be at bargain lows, with a return flight to Barcelona available for less than £30.

But costs linked to corona­virus, including testing and the threat of having to pay to quarantine in a hotel, mean the real cost of a trip soars by hundreds of pounds.

Earlier this week, we revealed how the average cost of hiring a car for a week in Europe had jumped by £144 to £500 since 2019. But today we lay bare the true scale of the price hikes facing families, with some rental firms now charging as much as £2,868 to hire a car for two weeks.

The price of extras such as children's car seats has also rocketed: they cost more than double in some locations.

Experts warn that hire firms are raising prices to recoup hefty losses made in lockdown when no one could travel and cover new costs from Covid, such as extra cleaning and safety measures.

There are also fewer rental cars available after many companies reduced the size of their fleet at the height of the pandemic.

Prices begin at £1,028 to hire an 'economy' Ford Fiesta for two weeks on the Greek island of Corfu this month, while the average price across all car sizes is £2,868, according to car-hire broker ­holidayautos.com.

By comparison, a two-week all-inclusive stay on the island at the Panorama Sidari Hotel, with flights from Manchester, costs from £640 per person in August, according to TravelSupermarket. Families could also be stung with extra unexpected charges that have increased significantly.

For example, Europcar is charging £52.58 for two weeks' rental of a car seat for children under four in Nice on the French Riviera, but £126.43 for the same seat in Sardinia or Sicily.

Travellers who have had to factor in extra holiday time to countries such as Italy — where Covid rules mean Britons must quarantine for five days on entry — are facing prices for car rental which work out more expensive than buying a second-hand vehicle.

Hiring a car for three weeks from Palermo airport in Sicily costs an average of £3,413 this August. You could buy a used car for less, with local adverts showing a 2009 Fiat Grande Punto on sale for €3,400 (£2,900) and a 1996 Mercedes Benz E Class for €1,900 (£1,600).

Natalie Ward and her family abandoned their plan to hire a car for their holiday in Menorca (pictured), after they were quoted £1,200 for a fortnight

In Verona — the airport closest to Lake Garda, Italy — budget car hire usually costs between £170 and £190 for three weeks in August, but this year the cheapest available family car for hire is £1,004.

After receiving their sky-high quote, Natalie, 35, a business director from Surrey, decided to go ahead with her July holiday to Menorca with her husband and children Harper, three, and Ethan, 22 months. But the family abandoned their plan to hire a car. 'In the end we decided to stay local,' she says.

'We spent €90 to get to and from the airport, and just walked to everything else. One taxi driver told us there were not enough cars on the island because of the uncertainty around Covid. The hire companies didn't order any, which was why the prices were so high.'

Afsaneh Parvizi-Wayne and her family booked a last-minute break to Greece, but were horrified to find the price of renting a family car was nearly £1,000 for a week. The needed the car to travel from Athens airport to their accommodation 235 miles away in the Peloponnese region.

I understand these companies have suffered in the past year and need to recover their costs, but it is jarring when you know you are being ripped off but you have no choice

To cut costs, Afsaneh, 56, a business founder from North London, resorted to booking a tiny Toyota Yaris for £745 for the week, including insurance. Her 6 ft 4 in husband Chris and their 23-year-old daughter Sophia, who is 5 ft 11 in, had to squeeze into the car with their knees up around their luggage for the four-hour drive.

'I understand these companies have suffered in the past year and need to recover their costs, but it is jarring when you know you are being ripped off but you have no choice,' Afsaneh says.

Ernesto Suarez, chief executive officer at iCarhireinsurance, says: 'There is always a lot of variation in car-hire prices, which are influenced by supply and demand. This is why there can be big differences in the same locations, and you may even get a different price with the same company depending on how far in advance you book.

'This year, rental companies will have faced additional costs to do with Covid, such as enhanced cleaning regimes and other measures to keep their customers and staff safe. These will inevitably have an impact on price.'

Holidaymakers are also being urged to check their contract's small print to avoid being left out of pocket if travel advice changes at the last minute. Many firms have flexible booking policies to allow drivers to cancel fee-free, but some of the cheapest deals are non-refundable or require at least 48 hours' notice.

Gerry Keaney, the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association's chief executive, says: 'Like the wider tourism sector, car rental prices will be adjusted to reflect supply and demand.

'Companies are also being cautious about building up their fleet size in the face of what is a very uncertain market in terms of travel restrictions and further waves of the pandemic.'

Vegetarian and vegan equivalents of the country's favourite BBQ foods can contain up to 10 times more sugar, MailOnline can reveal.

And the worst-offending meat-free alternatives — which are often bandied as healthier compared to traditional staples — are up to six times saltier.

Dietary experts warned meat-replacement items should not automatically be perceived as being 'healthier' just because they contain no red meat.

But they admitted that higher sugar and salt levels may not necessarily be worse because many veggie options have fewer calories, less fat and more fibre.

Our analysis delved into the nutritional benefits of a selection of BBQ favourites, including sausages and burgers, as well as kebabs, bacon and meatballs.

Vegetarian and vegan equivalents of the country's favourite BBQ foods can contain up to 10 times more sugar and six times more sugar than meat equivalents, MailOnline can reveal

Two vegetarian chilli and lime kebabs by Wicked Kitchen have 2g of sugar (top row, third picture), compared to just 0.2g for the same amount of Morrisons' lamb kebabs (top row, far right). Meanwhile, Vivera's plant steak has 2.4 grams of salt per 200 grams (top row, far right), while a ribeye steak of the same size sold at Sainsbury's contains just 0.4 grams (top row, second picture)

Meat can be part of healthy diet, British Nutrition Foundation says Meat and other animal products do not have to be removed from diets, the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) said. The BNF, a charity that advises on health eating, said it is 'important to consider the essential nutrients' that animal-derived products can provide. It examined 29 studies over the last 10 years that examined how diets impacted health and the environment. Vegetarian and vegan diets 'can deliver environmental benefits' but they are 'unlikely to be widely adopted' and may reduce intake of some essential nutrients found in meat, fish, milk and eggs, such as iron, zinc, calcium, iodine and vitamin B12, the BNF found. Meat is a good source of protein, but health chiefs have advised that consumption of it should be moderate, due to links between cancer and red meat, such as beef and lamb, and processed meat, including sausages and bacon. Cancer UK warns that chemicals found in the meat — that are added during processing or produced when cooking — damage cells which can increase the risk of cancer. These include haem, a red pigment naturally found in red meat that causes the body to produce harmful chemicals. Nitrates and nitrites used to keep processed meat fresher for longer are converted into cancer-causing chemicals — called N-nitroso compounds — when eaten. And chemicals produced when meat is cooked a high temperatures, called heterocyclic amines and polycyclic amines, can damage cells in the bowel. But the findings published by the BNF today said evidence from the studies it looked into did not suggest a need to cut out meat or other products entirely to eat a healthier and more-sustainable diet. Professor Judy Buttriss, director general of the British Nutrition Foundation and co-author of the review, said: 'While the evidence-base on sustainable food systems has grown significantly in recent years, all too often nutritional quality and delivery of essential nutrients is not considered in judgements about the environmental impact of foods and diets. 'It's vital that nutrition is central in discussions about transformation of food systems so that we don't risk encouraging dietary changes that might benefit the environment but could be detrimental to people's health'.

Per 100g of vegetarian chilli and lime kebabs made by Wicked Kitchen, there is 2g of sugar, compared to just 0.2g for the same amount of Morrisons' lamb kebabs.

And Two Birds Eye meat-free sausages contain 2.2g of sugar, compared to just 0.5g in two pork sausages sold at Tesco.

For burgers, there is less than 0.5g of sugar in the meat options sold at Sainsbury's and Waitrose.

But the vegetarian alternatives by Linda McCartney (0.9g), Heck (1.4g) and Morrisons (2.1g) have up to four times as much sugar.

Meanwhile, a plant-based steak by Vivera — which is sold at supermarkets including Sainsbury's and Asda — has 2.4g of sugar per 200g, while a ribeye steak on offer at Sainsbury's has less than 0.5g.

Two rashers of THIS' veggie bacon (0.3g) contain three times more sugar, compared to Tesco's pork option (0.1g).

And Linda McCartney's vegetarian meatballs (2.3g) have up to five times more than Asda's beef meatballs (less than 0.5g).

Meanwhile, the amount of salt in some vegetarian foods was the same or six times higher in some veggie options.

Vivera's plant steak has 2.4g of salt per 200g, while a ribeye steak of the same size sold at Sainsbury's contains just 0.4g.

The Birds Eye vegan sausages, as well as Richmond's vegetarian alternative, also contain just as much, if not more, salt than traditional options.

Two of Tesco's pork sausages contain 1.4g of salt, while the same product at Asda contains 1.3g. But the Birds Eye option has 1.5g.

None of the BBQ food options alone came close to the NHS recommendations of eating less than 90g of sugar or 6g of salt per day.

Across the board, vegetarian options contained fewer calories and much less fat, including saturates, than meat options.

The exception was Beyond Burger's plant-based patty, which had 21.4g of fat, compared to 19.2g in a Sainsbury's beef burger.

And of all the veggie sausages, burgers, steak, bacon and meatballs MailOnline looked at had more fibre than the meat options.

Meat products generally had much more protein, but there were a few exceptions. Birds Eye's meat-free sausages had 3g of extra protein than Asda's pork sausages.

And per burger, Beyond Burger's plant-based patty (19.2g) and Linda McCartney's mozzarella burger (20.8g) had more protein than in a Waitrose beef burger (17.8g).

A spokesperson for THIS told MailOnline there is natural occurring sugar in their produce which is 'minimal and from natural ingredients' soy and pea protein and includes no added sweeteners or sugar.

Professor Gunter Kuhnle, an expert in nutrition and food science at the University of Reading told MailOnline: 'I think one difficulty for many meat replacement products is that it is difficult to mimic the taste of the original product.

'I assume this is one reason for introducing more salt or sugar.'

He said from a health point of view, a vegetarian product that has 10 times more sugar than a meat product 'won't matter too much for most people' if the calories in the foods are similar.

'Higher salt content could have an impact on blood pressure and cardio-vascular diseases risk — but only if it is really high and would get someone easily over the daily recommendation,' he said.

Professor Kuhnle added: 'In general, I think there is a problem in the perception of foods being 'healthier' just because they contain no meat.

'Meat is neither healthy nor unhealthy. It's just a type of food that can provide energy and some essential nutrients (especially vitamin B12 and iron), but more importantly, that's enjoyed by many people.

'As with most other foods, consuming too much can have an adverse effect on health — in the case of meat increased risk of cancer and potentially heart diseases.

'The replacement has apparently more fibre and possibly also a better fat composition, which would make it 'healthier', but also more salt and sugar which would make it a bit unhealthier: one could argue that on balance, it probably won't matter as long as it is consumed as a part of a balanced diet and consumers are aware of it.

'I don't think I would be very concerned by this as long as the consumers are aware that the meat alternatives have a different composition.

'It would be good for producers to reduce salt and sugar content as far as possible — but this is sometimes more difficult than it seems as especially salt has a crucial role in food processing.'

Dr Giles Yeo, a principal research associate at Cambridge University's Metabolic Research Lab, told the Telegraph: 'You can be an unhealthy vegan, easily.

'There is inherently nothing wrong with [ultra-processed foods], but there’s something wrong with them when you eat a whole heap of them.

'I think that’s probably true whether you’re having a Chicken McNugget or an [meatless] Impossible Burger.'

Nikki Joule, policy manager at Diabetes UK, told MailOnline: 'Processed foods – whether vegetarian or not – often contain added salt and sugar, and so it's important to be aware of the ingredients and read labels.

'We encourage everyone to limit the amount of processed foods they eat, make meals from scratch as much as possible, and choose foods such as pulses, beans, nuts and plenty of vegetables.

'In addition, food manufacturers should work with reformulation programmes – where the recipes of food and drink products are adjusted to make them healthier – to significantly reduce the sugar, salt and calorie content of the food we buy.

'The UK government should consider further measures such as taxes, subsidies and penalties for non-compliance, to encourage reformulation among the food and drink industry.

'This would help make everyday food and drink healthier and ensure that the healthy choice is the easy choice.'

Studies have linked eating red meat with higher levels of heart disease and early death.

Researchers at the University of Oxford revealed last month that for every 50g per day of processed red meat eaten each day — such as bacon, ham and sausages — the risk of coronary heart disease goes up by 18 per cent.

The Department of Health advises that we eat no more than 70g (cooked weight) of red and processed meat a day, which is the average daily consumption in the UK.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Holidays abroad are back on… or are they? The much-heralded green list proved to be something of a damp squib, with the only popular British holiday destination on there being Portugal.

There was no place for Greece, France, Spain, Italy, the US, or other regular stars in the list of Britons’ favourite travel spots.

Some rushed to book trips to Portugal, but travel giant Tui reported this week that holidaymakers are cancelling and delaying bookings and rival On The Beach scrapped all its summer holiday departures before the end of August.

Concerns over Covid variants and worries about countries being rapidly pulled from the green list for travel are likely to prevent many from booking, but there is still a big desire from many vaccinated Britons to enjoy one their beloved trips abroad.

So, will there be a surge of bookings, a last minute wait and see game, or a race to grab the few remaining staycation places during the summer holidays?

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Simon Lambert and Grace Gausden look at the state of play for the travel industry and holidaymakers – and how to protect your hard-earned cash if you do book.

Highlighting the need to do just that, Grace explains why Teletext Holidays is under fire for still not refunding some customers for last year’s cancelled trips.

Holiday goers flock to the Algarve for sun, sea and sand b ut will that happen this year or will many people not trust the green list?

Also on this week’s show, Simon runs through his anecdotal inflation theory and why trying to buy bikes or garden furniture, find a builder, or fill up a car tells a very different story to the official 1 per cent inflation rate. He also explains why worries over higher inflation are causing markets to throw a wobbly.

This week, however, the Bank of England opted to stick at 0.1 per cent and upgraded its view on the economy for this year, saying GDP will only fall by a worst-in-a-century 9.5 per cent rather than a worst in 300-odd years 14.4 per cent.

It also hinted that negative rates could do more harm than good, so does that mean a base rate below zero is off the table for the UK?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost discuss negative rates: what’s the point, do they have any positives and beyond costing savers’ interest how would they prove harmful?

They also talk gold and why the price of the precious metal has soared 35 per cent this year, to rise above the $2,000 mark and whether it can keep going.

For goldbugs it is a long-term store of value, a safe haven and a hedge against inflation, but will fears of bumper inflation at the end of the decade prove unfounded - and is part of the gold price sentiment-driven in the same way Tesla shares are?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It's nearly June, the sun is shining, and right about now people would usually be eagerly anticipating summer breaks they’ve booked, or planning where to go away.

Meanwhile, the sunny weather over the past few months would usually have led to thoughts (and lots of features) on a staycation summer.

But this isn’t any given year.

Coronavirus and the lockdown means we are advised not to travel abroad, don't know when we will be able to, and might have to take an extra two weeks off to quarantine when we get back.

That should means it’s Cornwall, Devon, Norfolk, Wales, or a week in Skegness on our minds, instead of France or Spain.

Overnight trips are still barred though, the domestic holiday industry is unsure when it will be back up-and-running, and some locals are reportedly not too keen on visitors.

So, are we all going on a summer holiday?

And how can you protect yourself when booking and paying?

On this podcast, Simon Lambert, Lee Boyce and Georgie Frost talk holidays: where to go, when you might be allowed to, and the all-important financial side involving booking, cancellations and refunds.

There is also the thorny question of how travel will look in the future and whether the holiday industry will bounce back while people still have long waits and fights for refunds on cancelled trips fresh in their mind?

And finally, what about opting for van life instead?

Volkswagen revealed this week that quotes for its California campervans have soared in lockdown – and Simon fill us in on what it’s like to go away on a 2,000 mile road trip in one, having done a VW California review the summer before last.

He’s also got an idea, involving buying a campervan and renting it out, so that it pays for itself and turns a profit. Classic man maths or solid money-maker, you decide?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Aviva has bowed to activist pressure and agreed to hand back 'at least' £4billion to investors by next summer.

In a concession to Swedish investment firm Cevian, the British insurance group said it would launch an immediate share buy-back programme worth £750million.

It has announced a half-year dividend worth 7.4p per share or about £289million and is expected to outline further proposals.

Share buy-back: In a concession to Swedish investment firm Cevian, British insurance group Aviva said it would launch an immediate share buy-back programme worth £750m

Aviva's move follows demands from Cevian – its second-biggest investor – for larger returns to shareholders.

The hedge fund is run by Christer Gardell, who is known as 'the Butcher' for his ruthless and aggressive style.

Cevian has called for investor returns worth £5billion, cost cuts worth £500million by 2023 and a doubling of the annual dividend to 45p, all with the aim of lifting the insurer's share price above 800p.

Under Amanda Blanc, who took over as chief executive last summer, Aviva is expected to hit many of these targets.

She has vowed to focus more on its core markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada, flogging a string of the firm's other international divisions for £7.5billion.

Aviva boss Amanda Blanc (pictured) has vowed to focus more on its core markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada, flogging a string of the firm's other international divisions for £7.5bn

Aviva is also on track to wring out savings of £300million by next year, it confirmed yesterday.

However, Blanc's offer to return £4billion to investors yesterday falls short of the £5billion that Cevian has demanded.

Niko Pakalen, a partner at Cevian, said it was a 'good start' but 'would not be enough' on its own. 'We expect the company to return £5billion by the end of next year,' he said.

However, Blanc wants to use some of Aviva's cash to pay down debts by £1.7billion.

She said: 'We remain completely focused on transforming performance, capitalising on the breadth of Aviva, making insurance simple and easy for our customers, and creating value for our shareholders.'

She added that discussions would now be held with Cevian and other shareholders, saying the insurer's bosses were 'really pleased' with the plans set out.

'Hopefully everybody sees that in the same way,' she added, saying relations with Cevian bosses were 'constructive'.

Cevian revealed it had built a 5 per cent stake in Aviva earlier this year. Gardell, the hedge fund's managing partner, claimed the company has been 'poorly managed' for years, attacking high costs and 'bad decisions' made by bosses.

Aviva's announcement came as the firm reported £725million in adjusted half-year profits, up from £621million in 2020. The total worth of insurance premiums sold also rose, from £4.1billion to £4.4billion.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Well-timed: Sales of Cartier watches are up as the wealthy have excess cash to spend

The fortunes of the world's biggest luxury goods groups have been lifted by a splurge on expensive jewellery, watches, fashion and champagne as billions in spare cash is spent on big-budget treats.

Sales at 11 of the largest luxury groups and their brands have grown by a fifth on average compared with 2019, before the pandemic began. And they have more than doubled on last year.

The analysis by US financial services company Jefferies revealed many of the firms had cited strong demand in the US where $2.5trillion (£1.75trillion) in savings and a $1.9trillion stimulus package have left many with spare cash.

Savings on work travel, school fees and holiday costs – as well as readily available Government loans for small firms – have also unleashed a torrent of spending on high-end goods here in Britain.

Jewellery sales at Richemont, three quarters of whose business is jewellery and watches, outperformed those of many of its big rivals in the three months to the end of June, with a rise of 38 per cent globally compared with the same quarter in 2019, Jefferies said.

Richemont's Americas region drove much of the demand for its products, rising 276 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year.

Richemont owns the jewellery giant Cartier and watch brands Jaeger-LeCoultre and Piaget, as well as Montblanc, Chloé and Dunhill. Johann Rupert, Richemont's chairman, earlier this year said he was 'pleased' with sales at Cartier and noted his watch business was 'in a very healthy state'.

Faster retail openings in the US as well as a surge in online purchases globally and higher than anticipated spending in the West and Asia meant that the sector was now set to shatter growth expectations this year, Jefferies said.

Watches of Switzerland last week said sales of watches and jewellery had nearly doubled in the past 13 weeks, compared with a year ago.

Louise Deglise-Favre, a fashion analyst at GlobalData, said: 'The US has been bouncing back from Covid quite well and luxury brands have had tremendous growth there this year.

There has been more disposable income thanks to the stimulus cheques, extra funds and other side-effects of Covid-19.

What will be interesting is to see whether that will continue or whether this is an exceptional year.

But the luxury consumer is shifting to a younger demographic. So maybe these big brands are also beginning to tap into a much wider audience – basically getting in with the cool kids.'

She said Louis Vuitton, owned by LVMH, recently launched major campaigns with high profile influencers on social media to appeal to younger audiences.

Other brands have also sought to target younger shoppers. Last month TAG Heuer, also owned by LVMH, launched a $2,150 Super Mario watch as part of its connected range – with a firm eye on the gaming community.

Hermes said demand had been sustained in both its classic models and new ones such as the compact Hermes Della Cavalleria bag. LVMH said its Celine ready-to-wear and leather collections, created by designer Hedi Slimane to rejuvenate the brand, had done well.

Eddie Bloom at Bloombar Watches in London, which trades in preowned watches, said his sales doubled to £14million between 2020 and 2021 as cancelled holidays, private schools cutting fees as lessons took place on Zoom and a fall in living expenses left many with little to do with their money.

He said: 'There is a big shift as younger people get into watches. It has become a serious status symbol, wearing a Rolex Daytona or a Patek Philippe Nautilus.'

Supercar maker Bugatti has turned a one-off experimental prototype into an extreme £4.1million limited edition hypercar for the track.

Unveiled as part of the by-invitation-only Pebble Beach car extravaganza in California, and shown at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, only 40 examples of the new Bugatti Bolide will be built, with first deliveries from 2024.

The Bolide name itself comes from a French slang term that roughly translates as: 'It's a fast car.''

'Unbelievably fast': But the 40 Bolides will be for track use only and not road-legal

Described by Bugatti as 'extreme, light, and unbelievably fast', each one will cost around £4.1million, the equivalent of its European price tag of €4.8million - made up of a basic €4million plus 20 per cent tax.

A blast with the extras list could see even that stratospheric price climb as fast as the car accelerates.

The 40 Bolides will be for track use only and not road-legal. They are designed to stick to the tarmac like glue thanks to massive downforce generated by the aerodynamic design.

The new Bolide is powered by a vast 8.0-litre 1,600 horse-power W16 petrol engine. Although no exact performance figures have been released, it is expected to accelerate from rest to 62mph in under 3 seconds and go up to a top speed well over 200mph.

The car firm will likely attempt to beat the figures of the current fastest Bugatti Chiron Supersport, costing €3.2million, which accelerates to 62mph in under 3 seconds, to 124mph in 5.5 seconds, and goes up to a top speed of around 273mph (440km/hr).

Bugatti will likely attempt to beat the figures of the current fastest Bugatti Chiron Supersport

The firm said the emphasis was on the car's downforce giving it exceptional holding ability on the track noting: 'This will make the Bolide the most extreme configuration level of the legendary 8.0-litre W16 engine and a must-have for Bugatti collectors.'

Lightweight materials give the production version a kerb weight of just 1,450 kilograms and therefore a weight-to-power ratio of 0.9 kilograms per horsepower.

The French carmaker, with its boutique factory at Molsheim near the Rhine and just across the river from the border with Germany added: 'The new hyper sports car will be taken to production maturity over the next three years, with its delivery scheduled for 2024 at a and limited to 40 units.'

Bugatti first unveiled a prototype version of the Bolide as a one-of-a-kind experimental vehicle in October 2020. Now work on the production version has begun.

Lightweight materials give the production version a kerb weight of just 1,450 kilograms

The car firm said: 'When Bugatti presented its Bolide technological concept in autumn 2020, it was initially a drivable experimental vehicle - a one-off.'

It added that the final production car is 'raw and authentic' and 'the ultimate driving machine and the quintessence of power, lightness, and acceleration.'

The Bugatti team said the Bolide was born of an idea and a question: 'What if Bugatti built a radically light vehicle around the legendary 8.0-litre W16 engine? '

It noted: 'The upshot was the experimental study of the Bugatti Bolide as a racetrack-oriented hyper sports car with a production-based W16 engine and minimal bodywork designed with maximum downforce in mind. Presenting this engine in its purest form is the quintessence of the Bolide.'

They added: 'With the highly limited-edition production Bolide, Bugatti engineers and designers have created the most extreme vehicle concept ever to have been conceived around the powerful power train of the W16 engine with four turbochargers, offering the promise of the ultimate Bugatti performance kick.'

The production version has 1600PS because Bugatti opted for 98 RON petrol

Bugatti says design of the Bolide follows a minimalist approach of 'form follows performance' and uncompromising lightweight construction.

It said: 'It pays homage to the brand's glorious motorsport past of the in the 1920s. The numerous air ducts and delicate front end are more reminiscent of aerodynamically sophisticated Formula 1 cars than a hyper sports car, and they dominate its look. '

The new hypercar sits very low to the ground, with an air intake scoop on the roof and an ultra-sporty seat position.

Explaining how the hypercar sticks to the track, Bugatti said: 'In combination with the striking rear diffuser, the dominant rear wing results in high downforce and therefore also optimum traction.'

Each car has a split of colours, but 'the proportion of visible carbon parts is greater than in other models'.

The original Bolide experimental vehicle had 1,850 PS but this was achieved among other things thanks to 110-octane racing fuel.

The production version has 1600PS because Bugatti opted for 98 RON petrol, which is available worldwide 'so that the owners can use their vehicles around the world without any issues'.

Bugatti's designers and engineers are currently honing the aerodynamics and handling

To ensure safety standards in line with FIA race rules, Bugatti's designers and engineers are currently honing the aerodynamics and handling.

To help guarantee maximum safety and sufficient comfort Bugatti has also developed an array of new components, an automatic fire extinguishing system, pressure refuelling with a fuel bladder, central wheel locking, a six-point safety belt, and compatibility with a 'HANS' system designed when worn with a helmet to protect the neck, head and upper torso.

Bugatti president Stephan Winkelmann said: 'The Bolide generated a great deal of enthusiasm and intrigue last year. Following its presentation, a significant number of enthusiasts and collectors asked us to develop the experimental Bolide as a production vehicle. I was absolutely amazed by the reactions and feedback from customers from all over the world.'

Each car has a split of colours, but 'the proportion of visible carbon parts is greater than in other models'

As a result he said: 'We therefore decided to make the Bolide a few-off in order to give 40 customers the opportunity to experience this incredible vehicle. Our team has now been developing a production model - the ultimate driving machine for the track.'

Winkelmann added: 'The customers' safety is always our top priority. We therefore decided to offer exclusive track days for this extreme vehicle in order to guarantee a safe environment at all times and gradually introduce the customers to the Bolide's breath-taking performance.

'We are proud to have succeeded in keeping the production vehicle so close to its technical demonstrator both visually and technically while also enhancing the design, quality, and vehicle safety.'

Some experts say believe they won’t and this is the floor but others suggest they could come even down all the way to 0.5 per cent.

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Helen Crane and Simon Lambert look at what’s driving mortgage rates down and house prices up and whether it’s ever worth jumping ship to a potentially cheaper deal from an existing home loan?

Also on this week’s show, are you a property snooper, spying on friends, relatives and colleagues’ house prices and homes?

Plus, how to avoid getting too emotionally attached to your investments and is it worth tracking down DIY investing platforms and apps that offer fractional share dealing?

The cheapest two-year fixed rate mortgage is now at just 0.83%, can they go lower still?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Often the treatment of cancer is a high wire act for a physician, who has to administer the optimal dose to kill off the disease while ensuring the already sick patient doesn't feel the full force of the toxic side-effects.

Targeted drugs that take out the cancer cell, leaving healthy cells intact, would largely resolve this issue.

However, this precision approach comes with a massive challenge – and one that has largely stumped scientists for the last three decades.

Bivictrix's treatments target cancer with superior specificity, eradicating collateral damage

'There's actually a lack of cancer-specific targets on the surface of a cancer cell. Those you do find you'd also see on a healthy cell,' explains Tiffany Thorn, chief executive of BiVictriX.

'So, whilst using antibodies to target cancer cells is a good idea in principle, we've not really been able to unlock the full potential of these selective therapeutics in a way we thought was possible 30 years ago, because there's nothing selective on the cancer cells to actually target.'

Well, until now. Thorn is the inventor of an approach that leans heavily on her experience working in the NHS identifying cancer rather than treating it.

Spotting the signs of the disease meant looking for specific patterns on the surface of a cell (rather than a single cancer identifier); a fingerprint for cancer if you will.

Thorn and her team have taken the idea and exploited it for the first time in a therapeutic setting to generate Bi-Cygni treatments, which target the cancer with superior specificity, eradicating collateral damage.

The benefits, though yet to be fully proven at this early stage in process, should deliver what the experts call a 'highly selective' approach to tackling the illness.

What does that mean in practice? Well, all things being equal it should allow doctors to safely administer higher drug doses more effectively without the nasty, life-threatening side effects.

'The novelty of the company is twofold,' says Thorn.

'The first thing is we've identified cancer-specific fingerprints that we have access to and nobody else is working on them.

'So, they're unique to the company. We can differentiate healthy from diseased cells.

'The second thing is we develop drugs that only target those antigen fingerprints that we've identified.

'And those drugs are different to anything else that's currently in development because they only recognise these unique cancer cell fingerprints.'

The company's first cab off the rank is a BVX001, which binds an existing antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, to the company's 'fingerprint' technology to be selective for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

Thorn admits AML is a 'crowded' area for R&D, but one that has yielded precious few breakthroughs for an illness with an extremely poor prognosis (the five-year survival rate in over-65s is 5 per cent). The issue, as expounded at length above, is toxicity.

'It's a bold start,' Thorn says of the decision to develop a new treatment option for AML.

'But, if we can show that we can develop one of these therapeutics that is more selective in this disease indication, it shows the industry that actually there's a real benefit of this approach; because we will have gone for one of the hardest-to-treat cancers.'

Bivictrix recently listed on the London stock market, fundraising a net £6.7m

The big news recently has been the company's stock market float (the shares currently are 23.5p) a process that has brought in a net £6.7million of new funds, which equates to a cash runway of two years.

A good chunk of that new money will be put to work developing BVX001, which is likely to make it into the clinic within the next few years. It will also be deployed to expand the early-stage pipeline, and invested in patent protection of that pipeline.

Thorn, who at 33 must be one of the market's youngest chief executives, is supported by a highly experience boardroom team.

BiVictriX is chaired by Iain Ross, a veteran of the sector, who is supported by Professor Bob Hawkins, Susan Lowther and Drummond Paris.

They bring with them public markets know-how, technical expertise, financial knowledge and a deep understand of the ecosystem in which BiVictriX operates. 'I'm confident we will work well going forward,' says Thorn.

Looking ahead, the company will be making 'some key announcements' around new additions to the pipeline including an application for solid tumours.

'We'll also be filing a number of patents on both the lead molecule, and the pipeline as well,' adds Thorn.

Crucially, BiVictriX will be looking to produce data that shows the clear benefits of its technology versus an already established ADC drug on the market for AML.

'We are hoping to show that our drug outperforms both on safety and efficacy,' Thorn says.

This would then provide the support to take the discovery into clinical trials. After that it's the arduous process of testing BVX001 in humans. That said, success could transform the landscape for cancer treatment, making life easier for patient and doctor alike.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After a decade distorted by emergency rates and quantitative easing, investors need to rethink their strategy for a world where they can no longer simply rely on cheap money boosting returns.

That is the view of David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, who, in addition to using funds to invest for his clients, is also a committed stock-picker and believes buying individual company shares is still a route to success.

‘It’s a question of working out who’s got a good business model, who makes a profit, who’s borrowed too much money and has a balance sheet that will evaporate at the first sign of trouble,’ he says.

‘Those are judgements that are now having to be made after that longish period when much of a muchness seemed to be ok.’

David joins Simon Lambert, of This is Money, and Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, on the latest Investing Show to explain how he finds good companies.

He discusses what investors should look out for and highlights some of the opportunities he sees at the moment in the UK stock market, particularly those in the FTSE 250 going after the big guns’ business.

One company that he highlights as having profited from a successful business model, despite being in a tough sector, is retailer B&M.

Britain’s companies have seen a slight resurgence in interest from investors recently, having been out-of-favour for some time, but David says that he believes it’s important to dig deeper than countries or sectors and instead identify the companies that have carved out a successful niche and are capitalising on that.

What's the problem with a trade war?

Stock markets have stumbled on Donald Trump's tough stance on tariffs and fears of an international trade war.

But what is the problem with protectionist tariffs, why are investors worried and how big of a threat is a trade war to portfolios? Simon Lambert, Richard Hunter and Nick Batsford, of Core London, discuss it on the second part of this fortnight's Investing Show.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Housebuilder Bellway has seen its revenue rise by 41 per cent to over £3.1billion in the past year, after benefiting from surging demand from buyers looking for new homes.

House price inflation has benefited companies like Bellway, which saw the average price tag for its homes rise by 4.4 per cent to over £306,000 in the last 12 months.

Bellway also revealed it snapped up a record number of plots of land in the past year, totalling 19,819, against 12,124 plots last year and 13,284 plots back in 2019.

Surge: Housebuilder Bellway has seen its revenue rise by 41% to over £3.1bn in the past year

The group insisted it was undertaking a 'front-footed, yet disciplined' approach to buying land, aiming to focus its efforts in 'desirable locations.'

It added: 'The pricing environment remains positive, with house price inflation, which is benefitting selected sites in localities where demand is particularly strong, generally offsetting build cost pressures.'

Bellway hailed 'good underlying demand' across the country, with a private reservation rate of 169 per week, up from 141 in 2020 and 160 in 2019.

The group completed 10,138 homes in the past year, up from 7,522 last year, when lockdowns affected its operations.

Bellway said it had 'record' forward sales on its books, comprising 7,082 homes, with a value of just over £2billion, up from 6,588 homes last year.

The company said: 'There remain manageable short-term constraints in the supply chain and intermittent labour shortages across the sector as colleagues, subcontractors and suppliers are subject to self-isolation requirements to curtail the spread of Covid-19.'

Jason Honeyman, the group's chief executive, said: 'Bellway has delivered a strong performance, with volume output once again above 10,000 homes and housing revenue approaching 2019 levels.

'This positive recovery has been achieved through the hard work and dedication of our colleagues, subcontractors, and supply chain partners, while maintaining the high quality of our product and making further improvements in the service we offer our customers.

'Going forward, we are in an excellent position to continue our long-term growth strategy.

'The Group benefits from a substantial order book and a robust balance sheet. In addition, our record investment in land and the resultant strengthened land bank provides a strong platform for both volume growth and further margin recovery in the years ahead.'

Buyer interest: Bellway hailed 'good underlying demand' across the country, with a private reservation rate of 169 per week

Following the Grenfell fire, Bellway has set aside £131.6million since 2017 in relation to fire safety. It said today: 'Bellway continues to actively pursue recoveries from suppliers, subcontractors, and professional advisors where they have fallen short of the standards required.'

Bellway will publish its preliminary annual results on 19 October.

Shares in FTSE 250-listed Bellway are down 0.66 per cent or 22.00p to 3,288.00p at present. A year ago the company's share price was 2,565.00p, meaning it has risen by around 28 per cent in the past year.

Speaking to This is Money, Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: 'There’s a lot to like in Bellway Homes latest results particularly when it comes to forward sales. The heat in the housing market shows no signs of abating something the housebuilder says its ready to capitalise on.

'Issues with rising material costs are being swallowed by customers in a market where demand is still outstripping supply. There is one note of caution when it comes to supply with Bellway experiencing sector wide issues of material and labour shortages. It says they’re manageable, but close attention needs to be paid to how quickly those issues disappear or whether they’ll hang around into next year.'

Many housebuilders have seen a major spike in demand from buyers over the past year. Last week, Taylor Wimpey, one of Britain's biggest housebuilders, revealed it had returned to profit and upgraded its earnings targets after building a record number of homes in the first six months of the year.

The High Wycombe-based company built more than 7,300 homes in the first half of 2021, almost all of which have been pre-sold, allowing the company to lock in the benefit of soaring house prices triggered by cheap loans, the Government’s stamp duty holiday and a pandemic-driven preference for bigger houses.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Making predictions can be a mug’s game and never has that proved more true than for any made at the start of 2020.

It’s been an astonishing year, when the lives and freedoms we took for granted were dramatically disrupted – and one where ordering people to stay at home triggered the biggest economic crash in the UK since the Great Frost of 1709.

While looking forward to what might happen in 2020 will have proved fruitless, looking back certainly provides a few things to talk about.

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Lee Boyce and Simon Lambert look back over 2020 and by popular podcast listener demand combine it with the return of a socially-distanced Zoom Christmas taste test.

The team look at the low points, the high points and the bits in the middle of the year that has passed so far – and probably still has more to give.

From the economic nosedive, to the flirtation with negative rates and the stock market and housing market’s surprising buoyancy, they pick through the main issues.

And they look for the stories that provided some light relief, including Britain’s unlikely pandemic spending spree and hot tub boom.

Merry Christmas to all and wishing you a prosperous and less tumultous 2021.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Old King Coal may have been a merry old soul in the nursery rhyme, but being crowned the monarch of fossil fuels is rather less gratifying in these climate-conscious times.

That hasn't stopped analysts congratulating Glencore for taking on full ownership of a huge Colombian coal mine.

The mining and commodities company is paying $590million (£427million) for the two thirds of Cerrejon that it doesn't already own, buying out its two rivals BHP and Anglo-American.

Digging: Mining and commodities company Glencore bought out rivals to own a big coal mine

Glencore is choosing the arguably more difficult task of managing down its thermal coal mines while continuing to own them, while BHP and Anglo have sold out altogether.

Outgoing chief executive Ivan Glasenberg believes he has the moral high ground.

'Disposing of fossil fuel assets and making them someone else's issue is not the solution and it won't reduce absolute emissions,' he says. 'We are confident we can manage the decline of our fossil fuel portfolio in a responsible manner.'

Glencore has set tough emissions targets to become carbon neutral by 2050, which is more ambitious than other mining giants. It plans to deplete its coal mines by the mid 2040s.

Thermal coal use might be declining in the West, but its global use over the next five to six years is expected to be stable, thanks primarily to demand in South East Asia, says Ben Davis, mining analyst at Liberum.

Barclays analyst Ian Roussow calls the deal 'sensible' since it puts Cerrejon into Glencore's control, rather than leaving it as a joint venture with liabilities.

Glasenberg reckons the deal will pay for itself in two years, with Roussow saying it will generate 'attractive returns' for shareholders without compromising the firm's plans.

So what is left of Glencore once thermal coal is no longer an option for much of the globe?

The answer, fortunately, is 'transition metals' that will help to make the batteries to store the renewable energy we are all hoping will power the planet.

Glencore is a major producer of copper, nickel, zinc, vanadium and cobalt. At present, 36 per cent of the business is copper, 34 per cent coal, and 10 to 15 per cent of it involves the business of transporting commodities around the globe.

Liberum's Davis reckons Glencore's basket of commodities is more future-proofed than its rivals, focused less on iron ore and more on copper and other transition metals.

As demand continues to surge for these post-pandemic, many analysts believe Glencore's share price will follow.

The stock has had a good run of late but the shares have never returned to the £5.30 price at which they listed in 2011, and sit at £3.15.

That's more than double the price they dropped to in October 2020 in the depths of the pandemic.

Tyler Broda, analyst at RBC Markets, believes they have further to run, believing they could reach £3.60, while Barclays' Roussow has a £3.45 price target. Glencore has also reinstated its dividend, which it scrapped at the peak of the pandemic.

Although it is a modest expected payout, ensuring that the stock only yields around two per cent, Liberum's Davis says he expects more goodies for shareholders – either in the form of a special dividend or a share buyback.

Midas verdict: Investing in thermal coal is going to provoke a few raised eyebrows at dinner parties. But Glencore is doing its best to deal with environmental liabilities whilst providing value for shareholders.

There are clouds on the horizon, including the retirement of the current chief executive, and shareholder revolt over his replacement's pay. But the company has a decent presence in hot commodity sectors and the Cerrejon deal is a good one for all involved. All in all, it is worth digging deep for this one.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@My parents booked a family cruise with P&O through a local travel agent, PST Travel - 19 of us were due to go in August 2020 to celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary and my father's 90th birthday.

The cruise, which cost £17,124.74, was postponed for a year and then cancelled due to Covid. While P&O have returned £10,750, they still awaiting the further £6,374.74.

The travel agent says it has paid P&0 but it claims to have only received 60 per cent of the funds and hence won't repay the balance.

This has been going back and forth for months, even though the cruise was cancelled by P&0 in March 2021.

One family was due to go on a cruise on the IONA but is now struggling to get a full refund

Until my parents are reimbursed the full amount, we can't rebook a revised cruise and they might not have that many years left to cruise comfortably and enjoy what should be a fantastic two milestones.

Why are they having to wait so long for a refund and what can we do to speed up the process? P.N., via email

Grace Gausden, consumer expert at This is Money, replies: The customer service you received from P&O Cruises and the travel agent certainly did not float your boat.

It was due to be a once in a lifetime family cruise to celebrate your parents anniversary and your father's 90th birthday - you say they saved up for years to put aside the £17,000 needed.

The cruise was meant to be around the Norwegian Fjords on the IONA, a brand new ship whose build has been delayed due to Covid – hence why the trip was rescheduled to August 2021 initially before being cancelled.

GRACE ON THE CASE Our weekly column sees This is Money consumer expert Grace Gausden tackles reader problems and shines the light on companies doing both good and bad. Want her to investigate a problem, or do you want to praise a firm for going that extra mile? Get in touch: grace.gausden@thisismoney.co.uk

Your mother, who is 84, booked the cruise via a local travel agent, PST Travel, which is part of the Global Travel chain, paying the £17,215 in instalments for all 19 family members.

On 4 March 2021, the cruise was cancelled, and this started the long process of your parents, and you, chasing their refund.

After much back and forth, P&O started to send refunds in various amounts to eight members of the family totalling £10,750 in May.

This seemed very odd as your parents had paid the full amount with family members not chipping in at all.

However, they did all return the cheques to your parents who duly cashed them in – deciding not to return them to P&O and wait for the full amount as this was not forthcoming.

Despite this, P&O eventually said they refuse to pay any more as they can't find the funds on their computer.

Meanwhile, Global Travel claim it has paid P&O the full amount and sent evidence of this but the agent is struggling to get the cruise company to reply to emails and phone calls and to reimburse the funds.

You are concerned that if your parents do not rebook soon, they may be too elderly to travel

Until your parents are reimbursed the full amount, you are unable to rebook a revised cruise.

You say that time is of the essence due to their age, adding to the stress of the situation.

You have also experienced problems with getting P&0 to allocate the Future Cruise Credit to your booking.

This is for all guests who have had their cruise cancelled and essentially means the amount you have already paid which can be redeemed against any new booking.

However, P&O said it would only apply this on the funds it had received from the agent, not on the full cruise cost - meaning you would lose out on thousands of pounds worth of credit.

You say the firm were not interested in offering a similar cruise in return and instead hiked the prices by 25 per cent and insisting only the amount paid would be kept as a credit.

Therefore you opted for a refund and are now waiting for your parents to be repaid the £6,465.

I contacted P&O to find out why it was not returning the funds to the customer, stressing the importance of the trip due to the age of those booking.

Fortunately, it seemed to understand and decided to refund you the £6,465 straightaway. However, it does still claim it has not received the funds from PST Travel.

A P&O spokesperson said: 'We are extremely sorry to hear about this family's experience. We are yet to receive all payment due for their holiday from their booking agent.

'We want to bring this matter to a swift and positive conclusion for the family. Therefore, P&O Cruises will be refunding the money owed then retrospectively seeking our outstanding monies from their booking agent.

'We really hope that the family comes and travels with us at a future time.'

Without the full refund, your elderly parents do not have enough money to rebook the cruise

A spokesperson for PST Travel added: 'We are only too well aware of this booking and have every sympathy with the family over the very protracted delay in securing her refund which in our view has been totally unacceptable.

'Clearly this delay should never have happened and we believe it has been primarily an administrative/accounting mis-communication which has been compounded by the difficulties in contacting P&O and actually getting someone to act.

'From our point of view as agents, we have been doing everything possible to bring this to a conclusion and it is no exaggeration to say that if we charged for time as solicitors, we would be well into four figures which of course could never be charged to a client in any event.

'Whilst one can sympathise with the huge costs that have been incurred by the cruise companies, they are not helping their passengers or us as agents in taking protracted time to respond to any query – emails can be around two weeks and waiting time on the telephone can be up to an hour.'

Although P&O wasn't ferry impressive, hopefully now you can rebook the cruise as soon as possible with your parents and manage to get that once in a lifetime trip in.

One consumer found a courier had spilt red paint at the front of his house after a delivery

Hit and miss: This week's naughty and nice list

Each week, I look at some of the companies that have fallen short of expected standards as well as those that have gone that extra mile for customers.

Miss: In not such positive news, this week reader Max, got in touch about courier, XDP.

He said: 'XDP couriers spilt a tin of red paint in front of our house in December last year - it looked like the scene of a murder.

'They were delivering some items from Wayfair but must have spilled someone else's delivery of paint.

'After we complained, the firm appeared to accept liability, directly acknowledging the paint was still visible and passing me over to their insurers.

'However, it then went back on this saying it had already cleaned it and therefore accepts no liability as there's no paint to clean up.

'They made no such attempt and I have indisputable proof the courier has lied multiple times. I have 24/7 security camera footage from multiple angles available showing the paint spill.'

I contacted XDP as there is still very clearly a large, red, paint stain outside your home with video evidence proving it was the couriers who caused the spill.

Whilst XDP said it wouldn't be able to comment, you advised me that not long after I spoke to the firm, you were contacted to say it would now be prepared to pay the £677.18 cleaning bill.

Although XDP haven't painted themselves in the best light, at least you will not have to look at the red stain for much longer.

One consumer praised the customer service he received at the BA check in desk at Heathrow

Hit: In good news this week, reader Viv, praised bathroom firm, Croydex, for their speedy customer service.

She said: 'We purchased a shower caddy in 2019 with a five year anti corrosion guarantee.

'However it became rusty, so I emailed and sent photographs of the unit plus my purchase receipt and within about four days we received a replacement item.'

Good to hear a company being showered in praise.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Debra Winger has revealed that she quit the 1992 hit movie A League of Their Own after learning the director had hired Madonna to star alongside her.

The Oscar-nominated actress also claimed that she was still paid for it, having trained for months in the baseball-themed project, after being replaced by A-List star Geena Davis in the lead role.

Winger, 66, who trained with the Chicago Cubs for three months in preparation, told The Telegraph in a new interview that she felt director Penny Marshall was making 'an Elvis film' after casting Madge, 62.

Not winging it: Debra Winger has revealed that quit the 1992 hit movie A League of Their Own after learning the director had hired Madonna, despite training for three months (Pic, 2019)

'The studio agreed with me because it was the only time I ever collected a pay-or-play on my contract. In other words, I collected my pay even though I did not play, and that’s very hard to get in a court,' Winger explained.

The well-reviewed film that also starred Tom Hanks, went on to make $132.4million at the box office against a $40million budget, making it a resounding success.

Still, Winger has no regrets.

'As entertaining as [the finished film] was, you don't walk away going "Wow, those women did that." You kind of go "Is that true?"' she explained, stating her case.

Big success: The movie - also starring Rosie O'Donnell - went on to make $132.4million at the box office against a $40million budget. Still, Winger says she has no regrets.

Replacement: Winger's role was recast with A-List star Geena Davis instead

Winger also said that although the other stars didn't train as hard as she did, her replacement Davis, 65, 'did OK.'

'I certainly don't begrudge any of them,' Winger added. But when asked about Madonna's performance, Winger is said to have replied: 'I think [her] acting career has spoken for itself.'

Madonna has certainly had a very mixed career in the movie business, having won plaudits for her role in the 1996 Alan Parker film Evita, and been torn to shreds by critics in turkeys such as Guy Ritchie's Swept Away in 2002.

Mixed bag: Madonna - pictured with co-star O'Donnell at the premiere in '92 - is not known for being the best actress out there in Hollywood

Meanwhile, Winger notched up Academy Award nominations for her roles in critically-acclaimed films, An Officer and a Gentleman (1982), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Shadowlands (1993).

But the actress became the subject of a documentary in 2002 about her career taking a nosedive in later years, in Rosanna Arquette's Searching for Debra Winger.

In 1995 Winger claimed that she decided to take a hiatus from acting.

In the documentary she explained: 'I wanted out for years. I got sick of hearing myself say I wanted to quit.'

Elsewhere in her interview with The Telegraph, Winger said she felt the #MeToo movement has 'gone ridiculously too far in some ways'.

Winger told how she was encouraged to take water retention tablets to lose weight on the set of An Officer and a Gentleman because she looked 'puffy'. Pictured, with co-star Richard Gere

The American actress explained did not feel the situation had 'settled' yet following the upheaval in the film industry.

Now appearing in Apple TV+ series Mr Corman alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Winger said she views the #MeToo movement at least partly through the eyes of her three grown-up sons.

'I don't feel like it’s settled yet. [The industry] is still in upheaval,' she said.

'The plates are shifting. In some ways, it's pulled ridiculously too far. Part of it is that I’m the mother of three young white males, so I'm looking at things that they're experiencing, and things that my girlfriends of all different backgrounds are experiencing [and] it hasn't quite found its steady point yet where there's room for everybody.'

She added: 'I'm a bad one to ask. I always found my way. Is that privilege? It didn't feel like it at the time, because I felt like I was in very abusive situations, but it was my responsibility to buck up, get strong.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The price of petrol has just soared to an eight-year high, but motorists can knock a tenner off the rising cost of filling up their car by scouting out the cheapest garages – and simply sticking to the speed limit.

Last month saw the biggest rise in the price of unleaded petrol since the start of the year – up more than 3p to an average of £1.35 a litre, according to motoring organisation, the RAC.

Diesel now costs an average of £1.37 a litre – up almost 3p compared since the start of last month.

With the average car having a 60-litre tank, it means a full tank will now cost more than £80.

Research has found that driving at 80mph uses up to 25% more fuel than motoring at 70mph

But how much motorists pay will vary on where they fill up.

Supermarkets are currently charging an average of just over £1.32 for a litre of unleaded petrol while motorway service stations can charge as much as £1.49.

This difference can add up to total savings on a full tank of £10.20.

Northern Ireland is the cheapest place to get petrol – on average just over £1.31 for a litre of unleaded. In contrast, London motorists stump up almost £1.36 a litre.

Rod Dennis, spokesman for the RAC, says: 'The price of petrol on the forecourt continues to rise as more motorists get back on the road as we come out of lockdown.

'With the supply of oil still limited, extra demand is pushing up prices. But by being canny, motorists might be able to soften the pain by shopping around.'

The RAC has a 'fuel watch' link on its website that shows the average cost on the forecourt. It points out that at the very least motorists should try to better this price.

There are also handy free phone apps, such as PetrolPrices, that allow motorists to browse a map and discover the best petrol prices nearby – or on a planned journey.

Another way of reducing fuel bills is to drive more smoothly. The difference between putting your foot down on the accelerator and adopting a smoother driving approach can reduce fuel consumption by a quarter.

The average distance covered by British motorists each year is 7,400 miles, according to data collector NimbleFins.

Northern Ireland is cheapest place to get petrol - costing just over £1.31 for a litre of unleaded

With a car doing 40 miles to the gallon (8.8 miles per litre), the annual unleaded petrol fuel bill would be around £1,135.

By adopting a more cautious driving style, a motorist could shave more than £280 off this annual bill.

Neil Greig, policy and research director at advanced motoring organisation IAM RoadSmart, says: 'Driving smoothly has a huge impact on fuel consumption. Motorists should try to give extra space to vehicles in front and anticipate traffic so they do not waste fuel in braking and accelerating up to other cars, junctions and traffic lights.

'This will instantly cut fuel consumption.'

Turning off the air conditioning and opening a window instead can also cut fuel consumption by five per cent – as can ensuring the tyres are properly pumped up and there is no unnecessary heavy baggage in the car.

Sticking to the speed limit also helps. Research by motor reviewer WhatCar? has found that driving at 80mph uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than motoring at 70mph.

With petrol prices so high, it is worth remembering that the lion's share of the price is taken by the Treasury.

For every litre purchased, nearly 58p goes straight to HM Revenue & Customs. Fuel also attracts VAT at 20 per cent.

It means more than 60 per cent of the price of a £1.35 litre of fuel goes on tax.

Crude oil prices fell to $31 a barrel in March last year, but are currently close to $70. Experts predict the price could soon break the $80 barrier.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When a Thatcherite purist such as Nigel Vinson, stalwart of the free market Institute of Economic Affairs, loudly opposes a private equity takeover of Bradford-based supermarket chain Morrisons, you wonder why the Iron Lady’s disciples are not of the same mind.

Not a peep has so far been heard from Chancellor Rishi Sunak, a laissez-faire thinker who represents a Yorkshire constituency in Morrisons territory.

As for Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, author of the volume Thatcher’s Trial, he purred with support for the £6.7billion takeover offer from Fortress after reassurances from the supermarket group’s chairman Andy Higginson.

Among the puzzles about the bidding shoot-out for Morrisons is that it is between two overseas-controlled entities. No one has come up with a home-based solution

One cannot imagine Margaret Thatcher falling for the soft-soap without asking forensic questions and making sure commitments made in the heat of a merger battle are legally enforceable.

Among the puzzles about the bidding shoot-out for Morrisons is that it is between two overseas-controlled entities, Softbank-backed Fortress and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). No one has come up with a home-based solution.

One City veteran suggested that a good combination for Morrisons would be with Sainsbury’s, bringing together its strengths in the South with Morrisons’ northern footprint.

But it would be a case of once bitten, twice shy for Sainsbury’s after its previous merger proposal with Asda was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority.

If that wouldn’t work then a different type of high street deal might. A merger between M&S and Morrisons might be good sense.

Both pride themselves on food quality. Morrisons’ fresh produce, from its own fishing fleet to its cheese production, is outstanding. It does some of its online deliveries on the jointly owned M&S-Ocado channel.

Even more radical would be for the UK’s most successful clothing and home products retailer, Next, run by the shrewd Simon Wolfson, to acquire or merge with Morrisons, giving it a quality stake in food.

It shows a lack of imagination and ambition, by all these entities, that they are happy to stand by and watch private equity plunder Morrisons rather than take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape their enterprises.

One cannot imagine some of the retail giants of the past such as Geoff Mulcahy, creator of Kingfisher, or James ‘retail is detail’ Gulliver, boss of Fine Fare and Safeway, standing on the sidelines.

Sinking funds

This ought to be a golden era for UK fund managers. As occupants of one of the world’s great financial hubs, they ought to be attracting vast inflows while equity markets boom around the globe.

But Abrdn (the old Aberdeen Standard Life) and M&G are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Giants such as Blackrock, Fidelity and Vanguard have been attracting vast inflows.

Managers with big reputations, such as Schroders and Goldman Sachs, prosper along with platforms catering for private investors.

There are signs in the latest financial results that both firms are regaining their mojo. Abrdn was a pioneer in investing in Asia and chief executive Stephen Bird is seeking to regain that territory through a distribution agreement with Citi.

It wants to soup up its private investor offering by acquiring AI digital innovator Exo and is making a big play for ESG.

The numbers are starting to improve, with outflows down to £8.3billion, against £26.8billion in the first half of last year. And it is displacing lower income older assets with newer mandates with higher performance fees.

John Foley, at M&G, has been swimming against the tide too but has managed to harvest European institutional clients, and netted a modest £2.2billion net inflow.

The rate of net retail outflows has slowed and there is hope its PruFund Planet, addressing green and social issues, will be a crowd-pleaser.

Both firms have a chance for a big say in the outcome of the current private equity crapshoot. They should fly the flag for UK defence, grocery and health products rather than take the cash and run.

Winner takes all

For investors willing to back UK-quoted gambling giants the returns can be spectacular.

The US stock market has also been boosted by positive vaccine news and the election seemingly delivering a result, despite the disputing of it by incumbent President Trump.

This has boosted the global stock market through November but now markets are in something of a holding pattern as they mull over what happens next.

What will President-Elect Joe Biden mean for the recovery, will a next round of US stimulus arrive, and can the world start rolling out vaccines swiftly enough to avoid a long winter of lockdowns?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Can you make a profit and get your money to do some good?

The stereotypical image of the stock market and investing isn’t one of caring about the world around you, it’s more characterised by a make money at all costs attitude.

But like many stereotypes that’s not accurate.

Most personal investors are just ordinary people trying to grow their wealth over the long term – and like the population at large many of them care about the environment, people being treated well and business being done properly.

But while it has never been easier to be a DIY investor, how often do people really think about where their money is going and what it is doing?

Socially responsible investing is a concept that seeks to change that. Trying to get ordinary investors to engage with their investments and use them to improve the world, whether that is at a corporate, social or environmental level.

On this second This is Money investing special podcast, Simon Lambert is joined again by Rob Morgan, Charles Stanley Direct’s pensions and investment analyst, to explore the world of socially responsible investing.

They talk about what it means, where the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) buzzphrase has come from, how things have changed from the early days of ethical investing and what kind of investments people can make to improve the world we live in.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The extraordinary stock market recovery since the depths of the coronavirus crash has surprised many investors.

Growth companies and technology stars led the way in the rebound, but investors are now asking whether those stocks can repeat that trick or something else will do well in 2021?

One market with the potential to do well in the year ahead lies close to home, says Tom Becket, chief investment officer of Psigma Investment Management on the latest Investing Show: Britain.

He says: ‘I think next year could be a good year for UK equities, because they probably are the perfect way to play the global reopening trade at a fair price.’

Although not outstandingly cheap, ‘UK equities are much cheaper than global peers,’ says Tom.

He adds that a catalyst could be some form of successful conclusion to the ‘never-ending Brexit saga’ that removes the stigma of investing in Britain for major global investors.

On this show, Tom, Richard Hunter and Simon Lambert discuss the outlook for British shares over the next year, along with global markets.

The main thing driving markets at the moment is colossal stimulus from central banks, argues Tom, and he says that as long as money remains cheap and flowing, investors are likely to back the reopening of economies if coronavirus measures can be eased.

The trio also discuss where to look for dividends now – and in a show filmed before the announcement that UK banks could pay them again, they are highlighted as an option – and the supposed rotation from growth to value stocks.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Parents shrewdly putting aside money for their children in the future are in danger of seeing the value of their cash fall due to inflation.

Although encouragingly three in four parents are saving or investing money for their children, the overwhelming majority – 83 per cent - are doing so exclusively in cash, according to new research by Natwest.

With savings rates at record lows and inflation rising to 2.5 per cent last month, there is currently not one adult savings rate that will protect cash from being gradually eroded over time.

You can currently make a maximum of 1.66 per cent in a standard savings account, and that involves tying your money up for five years.

Peter Flavel, chief executive of Coutts Bank and NatWest's wealth businesses said: 'It's encouraging to see how many people are saving and investing for their children.

'But with so much of these savings being cash, the concern is that the customer isn't aware that the impact of inflation means the purchasing power of these "safe" cash balances actually goes backwards over the longer term.'

The NatWest data also revealed that nearly one in five parents saving for their child are doing so by putting away cash in their bank, while 15 per cent are using NS&I Premium or Children's bonds.

For those stashing the cash in their own bank the outlook for the money is bleak given rising inflation.

The average easy-access account pays just 0.17 per cent interest, according to Moneyfacts, and most of biggest banks are paying between 0.01 per cent and 0.06 per cent interest across their range of easy-access accounts.

Based on the current average easy access rate, were you to save £250 every month (£3,000 a year) for your child for 16 years, you could expect to end up with a sum of £48,655.27 - only £655.27 earned in interest.

If inflation were to rise by an average of 2.5 per cent over the next 16 years the actual value of this, even with the interest added, will fall by one third, meaning in 16 years your savings will be worth the equivalent of £32,449 in terms of purchasing power.

NS&I children's bonds are no longer on sale, having been withdrawn in 2017, but for those buying NS&I Premium Bonds, they at least are in with a slim chance of winning cash prizes ranging from £25 to £1million every month.

Anyone can buy Premium Bonds for a child under 16 and it is possible for them to hold up to £50,000 worth of bonds.

However, the current odds of any £1 Bond winning have been reduced from 24,500 to one to 34,500 to one and with over 110billion bond numbers eligible, the chances of your child winning one of the two £1million prizes, or five £100,000 prizes will be almost nil.

Junior cash Isas offer parents better returns than other savings vehicles with the added benefit of higher interest rates and the fact you will not pay any tax on the interest earned.

The average junior cash Isa is 1.67 per cent, according to Moneyfacts with the best deal on the market available through Bath Building Society currently paying 2.5 per cent interest.

Junior Isas can be opened for any child living in the UK under the age of 18 and parents can contribute up to £9,000 each tax year.

Rachel Springall, personal finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: 'Junior Isas pay much higher interest rates than a bank account, and since the start of this tax year, savers can save up to £9,000, up from £4,368 previously.

'The perk of a Junior Isa is that the balance is designed to go to the child solely, and whilst they can manage the account from the age of 16, they will not be able to access the funds until they turn 18.

'With this in mind, the account is designed to prevent parents dipping into the savings fund for other reasons.'

Despite the higher interest and tax-free advantages, you're likely to see bigger gains for your child over the long run, were your money invested via a stocks and shares Junior Isa.

Similar to the junior cash Isa, any money invested will not be subject to tax on any capital growth or dividends received.

Your child can have one or both types of the Junior Isa as long as the combined pot keeps within the £9,000 tax year limit.

Flavel said: 'We think that at least half, maybe even two thirds of Isa balances ought to have been placed in competitively priced stock and shares Isas.

'But the continued preference for cash suggests that Isas aren't really helping the UK's medium-term savings pool in the way they best could.'

As for the one in four parents who aren't putting money aside for their children, the main reason, according to Natwest, is because they cannot afford to.

But, nearly one in 10 said they simply don't know where to turn to for advice, and a similar number simply don't know how to do so.

For a quarter of Britons, worthwhile returns would convince them to start saving or investing for their child but for roughly one in seven, more advice on the subject would help them do so.

Should you invest or save for your child's future?

Although the Junior cash Isa offers more security to parents who may be uneasy with the concept of investing, in the long-term, a stocks and shares Junior Isa should outperform its cash alternative.

If you were to save £250 a month (£3,000 a year), for 16 years into the average junior cash Isa account paying 1.67 per cent, you will end up with £54,981 – just shy of a £7,000 return for your efforts.

But in terms of purchasing power, were inflation to remain at 2.5 per cent, you would actually end up worse off with your £54,981 after 16 years being worth the equivalent of £36,668 in terms of purchasing power.

Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, says: 'For Junior Isas where the investment time horizon is often decades, taking at least some investment risk will be the better option.

'Through the power of compounding – described as the 'eighth wonder of the world' by Albert Einstein – patient investors can build wealth over the years.'

But your decision will also depend on how soon you will be giving the money to your child.

David Gibb, chartered financial planner at Quilter, says: 'If you were to start saving for a child as soon as they are born then it gives you an 18-year investment horizon, which should be more than enough time to ride out any volatility and ultimately beat any returns from cash savings.

'If a child is close to 18 and is likely to take the money out as soon as they reach their 18th birthday then saving it in a cash junior Isa may be a better option.

'However, if you are looking to put money away for a child just after they were born then you are much more likely to get higher returns from a Stocks and shares junior Isa.'

How easy it to set up a Junior Isa?

Not so long ago, investing typically required a stockbroker or financial adviser and the willingness to hand over a big chunk of commission.

Now armed with a computer - or just a smartphone - investors can use a DIY investing platform or online broker and the wealth of research at their fingertips to hopefully build their fortune.

'It has never been easier to open a Junior Isa and the application process can usually be done in minutes online,' says Selby.

'To open a Junior Isa you must be the parent or legal guardian of the child in question.

Parents may have views about what they want their child to spend the money on. But once the child turns 18, the funds from the Junior Isa becomes their money and they can do what they like with it.

'However, once opened anyone – including grandparents, uncles and friends – is allowed to pay into a Junior Isa.'

DIY investing platforms act as a place to buy, sell and hold all your investments and to have a tax-efficient wrapper around them if you choose to invest in an Isa.

When weighing up the right one for you, it's important to look at the service that it offers including whether it includes Junior Isas, along with administration charges and dealing fees, plus any other extra costs.

We have written an extensive guide on the best and cheapest DIY investing platforms, which might help you in deciding.

What should you invest in?

Once you have chosen which platform or provider to invest through, the next daunting task is to choose what to invest in.

Many of the investing platforms allow you to invest in a large range of funds, investment trusts and if you're feeling particularly daring, individual stocks and shares – although the range of choice varies between providers.

'In order to invest in a fund or trust, you will need to pay a manager to run your money,' says Selby.

'It is also possible to invest directly in stocks and shares using a Junior Isa, but while this will remove fund manager costs you will still have to pay platform costs, including the cost of buying and selling shares.

'This can also be quite time consuming, with investors ideally researching and assessing companies from around the globe in order to build a diversified portfolio that meets their needs and appetite for risk.

'This diversification is absolutely key as saving too much in one area of the world or type of asset risks leaving you more exposed to sudden shocks.'

If you would prefer to leave your money in the hands of fund managers then this certainly has its benefits as well as removing some of the stress and research involved when picking individual stocks.

But there still remains a question of how many funds or investment trusts it is sensible to invest in?

'There is no 'right' number of funds or trusts to hold as this will depend on the nature of the funds and trusts in question,' says Selby.

'Some multi-asset funds, for example, will come with built-in diversification across different regions and sectors, meaning it could be appropriate to have your money invested in a handful – or even one.

'Others will be targeted at specific parts of the world or the economy, in which case having a few more might be necessary.'

For those who would rather not have to make any decisions themselves, there are even options that mean you won't have to make a choice.

Online investment management services like Nutmeg and Wealthify will invest on your behalf in accordance with your personal risk profile.

You can control a Junior Isa all from an app on your phone and change your risk profile as and when your circumstances require.

Why wouldn't you set up a Junior Isa?

One thing that parents should be aware of before thinking about investing in a Junior Isa is that once the child turns 18, it becomes their money to do what they like with.

'It is crucial for a parent to feel confident that the money will be spent sensibly particularly if building up significant sums,' says Gibb.

'For those parents who are less sure their child will use their new found funds wisely they might want to consider setting up a trust.

'A trust will enable trustees - the people that manage the trust - to maintain a degree of control over how the money is spent.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An American aerospace company has launched an audacious attempt to gatecrash the £6.3billion takeover of British group Meggitt.

Transdigm has proposed buying the FTSE 250 defence contractor for 900p per share.

This values Meggitt at a whopping £7billion and far outweighs an 800p bid from another American company, – Parker Hannifin – that Meggitt's board agreed to last week.

Target acquired: US aerospace firm Transdigm has proposed buying Meggitt for 900p per share which values the FTSE 250 defence contractor at a whopping £7bn

Meggitt's shares rose 16.1 per cent, or 115p, to 830p last night, indicating that shareholders believe Transdigm could successfully hijack the deal.

Transdigm has not yet put in a formal offer, so Meggitt's board are still backing Parker. But even if it wins the company's support, Transdigm could still face an uphill battle to convince ministers a sale would not put Britain's national security at risk.

Parker's approach triggered outcry among MPs and military figures, such as former head of the Royal Navy Admiral Lord West, who said there was a 'real risk' it could compromise security. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was already monitoring Meggitt's talks with Parker.

The issue has been compounded by a takeover frenzy that has seen private equity firms and foreign companies swoop on British companies.

This includes another FTSE 250 firm, Ultra Electronics, whose sale has also raised alarm.

Coventry-based Meggitt traces its origins back to the 1850s and now has a 9,000 staff, including more than 2,000 in the UK, and makes parts for planes and military aircraft.

This includes making 'black boxes' for the RAF's Typhoon jets and the wheel and brake systems for American F-35s.

Transdigm, which is worth £25billion, was founded in 1993 and has risen to become a member of New York's S&P 500 index.

It has been a serial dealmaker, buying up around 60 businesses in its first 25 years, and is split into around 46 companies.

These make everything from parachutes to pumps and valves. In January it bought the aerospace and connectivity arm of former FTSE 250 group Cobham for £696million.

Both Parker and Transdigm are based in Cleveland, Ohio, where the Wright Brothers worked on the world's first aeroplanes.

Parker's offer was 70.5 per cent higher than Meggitt's share price before the deal was announced – a huge premium by City standards.

But Transdigm's is a jaw-dropping 92 per cent higher.

Parker has undertaken to keep Meggitt's HQ in the UK and invest in research and development.

The offers, which were also an attempt to assuage ministers' doubts, have been heavily criticised as most are only valid for one year.

Meggitt yesterday said: 'The board… will continue to consider carefully not only the financial terms of any offer but also Transdigm's plans for the company and the potential impact across all its stakeholders.'

These include Meggitt's staff, pension schemes and the Ministry of Defence.

Transdigm faces being treated warily as it has also pitched itself as having a 'private equity-like capital structure and culture'.

It aims to provide big returns and says it can create value, which, for private equity firms, often means it will buy a business but then break it up and sell many or all of the parts to the highest bidder.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Online fashion star Boohoo has announced plans to create 5,000 jobs over the next five years, as it battles back from criticism over poor working conditions at suppliers.

The fast-growing retailer, which recently bought the Debenhams brand, said jobs will come from a £500million growth programme, as it expands its warehouse and builds new IT systems.

Jobs are expected to be created at both its head office in Manchester and warehouse in Burnley.

Boohoo's boss has also said that it will try to improve the environmental impact of fast fashion by making at least 20 per cent of its clothes sustainable by autumn and 40 per cent by next spring.

The announcement came as Boohoo published a report on its positive economic impact on the UK.

It claimed that Boohoo added £559.4million to the economy in the past year, meaning the business now accounts for 4.4 per cent of the total UK clothing and footwear retail sector.

The fashion retailer also claimed it supported 8,050 full-time roles and that for every job created by Boohoo and its brands, a further 1.7 were added to the wider economy.

The storm over suppliers and concerns over fast fashion's environmental impact have weighed heavily on Boohoo shares at a time when screening for Environmental, Social and Governance attributes are all the rage in the investment world.

Boohoo shares rose 4.1 per cent, or 10.9p, to 276.8p towards London market close, but remain well below their peak of just over 400p last summer.

Boohoo has been trying to shed its negative image following revelations that some of its suppliers in Leicester had been operating in sweatshop conditions.

Last summer, two of its factories in the UK were accused of poor working conditions and of paying as little as £3.50 to £4 an hour to workers producing its clothes.

The group has cut ties with hundreds of its suppliers since then, and pledged to link multimillion-pound bonuses for its directors with improvements in its supply chain.

But some shareholder groups and investors remain dissatisfied, with over 20 per cent of votes opposing the company's remuneration report at its annual general meeting in June.

Some 12 per cent of votes were also cast against the re-election of co-founder and executive director Carol Kane.

Over the past year, Boohoo has snapped up a series of failed high street names, including Coast, Karen Millen, Dorothy Perkins and Debenhams.

In 2021, they bought two new warehouses, one in Wellingborough and one in Daventry, both of which give the group an additional 1.845million square feet of space and support over 2,000 jobs, it added.

In logistics alone, the group employs 7,000 people at four distribution centres in the UK and ships between 190,000 and 230,000 parcels a day, which are handled by 13 main courier companies and supported an estimated 1,660 jobs in the last financial year, it said.

In the report, it also claimed that it moved over 1,400 agency colleagues from its warehouse teams onto permanent boohoo contracts in the last financial year.

Boohoo has released a positive impact report after coming under fire for claimed poor working practices at its suppliers (Pictured: Emma Claire attends the boohoo Black Friday gifting suite last year)

Sustainability has also become a key talking point in the sector, with shoppers opting to keep items of clothing for longer and move away from so-called 'throwaway fashion'.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live’s Wake Up To Money podcast, chief executive John Lyttle said sustainability will take several years to achieve.

He said: 'We’re trying make the journey as sustainable as possible… 20 per cent of all our ranges will be sustainable this autumn… 40 per cent next spring/summer.'

He added: 'They’re not going to be fixed in six and 12 months… It’s the same 2030 timeframe as combustible engines.'

Sustainability concerns: CEO John Lyttle said sustainability will take several years to achieve

However, there is no mention of this in its latest report 'Agenda for Change' published today.

However, Noelle Hatley, senior lecturer in fashion business at Manchester's Fashion Institute, told the BBC that brands were able to use the term 'sustainable' because there was 'no industry-wide agreement on its meaning'.

'40% is a reasonable target, but it all hinges on what they mean by sustainable and how much information they will actually share with the customers,' she said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Aviva has bowed to activist pressure and agreed to hand back 'at least' £4billion to investors by next summer.

In a concession to Swedish investment firm Cevian, the British insurance group said it would launch an immediate share buy-back programme worth £750million.

It has announced a half-year dividend worth 7.4p per share or about £289million and is expected to outline further proposals.

Share buy-back: In a concession to Swedish investment firm Cevian, British insurance group Aviva said it would launch an immediate share buy-back programme worth £750m

Aviva's move follows demands from Cevian – its second-biggest investor – for larger returns to shareholders.

The hedge fund is run by Christer Gardell, who is known as 'the Butcher' for his ruthless and aggressive style.

Cevian has called for investor returns worth £5billion, cost cuts worth £500million by 2023 and a doubling of the annual dividend to 45p, all with the aim of lifting the insurer's share price above 800p.

Under Amanda Blanc, who took over as chief executive last summer, Aviva is expected to hit many of these targets.

She has vowed to focus more on its core markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada, flogging a string of the firm's other international divisions for £7.5billion.

Aviva boss Amanda Blanc (pictured) has vowed to focus more on its core markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada, flogging a string of the firm's other international divisions for £7.5bn

Aviva is also on track to wring out savings of £300million by next year, it confirmed yesterday.

However, Blanc's offer to return £4billion to investors yesterday falls short of the £5billion that Cevian has demanded.

Niko Pakalen, a partner at Cevian, said it was a 'good start' but 'would not be enough' on its own. 'We expect the company to return £5billion by the end of next year,' he said.

However, Blanc wants to use some of Aviva's cash to pay down debts by £1.7billion.

She said: 'We remain completely focused on transforming performance, capitalising on the breadth of Aviva, making insurance simple and easy for our customers, and creating value for our shareholders.'

She added that discussions would now be held with Cevian and other shareholders, saying the insurer's bosses were 'really pleased' with the plans set out.

'Hopefully everybody sees that in the same way,' she added, saying relations with Cevian bosses were 'constructive'.

Cevian revealed it had built a 5 per cent stake in Aviva earlier this year. Gardell, the hedge fund's managing partner, claimed the company has been 'poorly managed' for years, attacking high costs and 'bad decisions' made by bosses.

Aviva's announcement came as the firm reported £725million in adjusted half-year profits, up from £621million in 2020. The total worth of insurance premiums sold also rose, from £4.1billion to £4.4billion.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Well-timed: Sales of Cartier watches are up as the wealthy have excess cash to spend

The fortunes of the world's biggest luxury goods groups have been lifted by a splurge on expensive jewellery, watches, fashion and champagne as billions in spare cash is spent on big-budget treats.

Sales at 11 of the largest luxury groups and their brands have grown by a fifth on average compared with 2019, before the pandemic began. And they have more than doubled on last year.

The analysis by US financial services company Jefferies revealed many of the firms had cited strong demand in the US where $2.5trillion (£1.75trillion) in savings and a $1.9trillion stimulus package have left many with spare cash.

Savings on work travel, school fees and holiday costs – as well as readily available Government loans for small firms – have also unleashed a torrent of spending on high-end goods here in Britain.

Jewellery sales at Richemont, three quarters of whose business is jewellery and watches, outperformed those of many of its big rivals in the three months to the end of June, with a rise of 38 per cent globally compared with the same quarter in 2019, Jefferies said.

Richemont's Americas region drove much of the demand for its products, rising 276 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year.

Richemont owns the jewellery giant Cartier and watch brands Jaeger-LeCoultre and Piaget, as well as Montblanc, Chloé and Dunhill. Johann Rupert, Richemont's chairman, earlier this year said he was 'pleased' with sales at Cartier and noted his watch business was 'in a very healthy state'.

Faster retail openings in the US as well as a surge in online purchases globally and higher than anticipated spending in the West and Asia meant that the sector was now set to shatter growth expectations this year, Jefferies said.

Watches of Switzerland last week said sales of watches and jewellery had nearly doubled in the past 13 weeks, compared with a year ago.

Louise Deglise-Favre, a fashion analyst at GlobalData, said: 'The US has been bouncing back from Covid quite well and luxury brands have had tremendous growth there this year.

There has been more disposable income thanks to the stimulus cheques, extra funds and other side-effects of Covid-19.

What will be interesting is to see whether that will continue or whether this is an exceptional year.

But the luxury consumer is shifting to a younger demographic. So maybe these big brands are also beginning to tap into a much wider audience – basically getting in with the cool kids.'

She said Louis Vuitton, owned by LVMH, recently launched major campaigns with high profile influencers on social media to appeal to younger audiences.

Other brands have also sought to target younger shoppers. Last month TAG Heuer, also owned by LVMH, launched a $2,150 Super Mario watch as part of its connected range – with a firm eye on the gaming community.

Hermes said demand had been sustained in both its classic models and new ones such as the compact Hermes Della Cavalleria bag. LVMH said its Celine ready-to-wear and leather collections, created by designer Hedi Slimane to rejuvenate the brand, had done well.

Eddie Bloom at Bloombar Watches in London, which trades in preowned watches, said his sales doubled to £14million between 2020 and 2021 as cancelled holidays, private schools cutting fees as lessons took place on Zoom and a fall in living expenses left many with little to do with their money.

He said: 'There is a big shift as younger people get into watches. It has become a serious status symbol, wearing a Rolex Daytona or a Patek Philippe Nautilus.'

The 24-year-old Riverdale star and the 27-year-old model were seen leaving the celebration for KJ's castmate and close friend in Los Feliz.

The parents-to-be were all smiles as they walked down the sidewalk to their car.

Out on the town: KJ Apa and his pregnant girlfriend Clara Berry were spotted at Cole Sprouse's birthday party on Friday night

KJ kept it casual in a white t-shirt and paint-splatted blue jeans paired with yellow Converse sneakers.

The New Zealand native wore his signature red locks tousled and sported a mustache, having shaving off his beard.

Berry turned heads in a boldly printed sweatpants with a matching jacket. She left the jacket unzipped over a leopard print cut-out sports bra.

Clara's baggy sweatpants were pulled down low on her hips, showing off her growing baby belly. She completed her dressed down ensemble with white sneakers.

The brunette beauty's long locks fell loose around her shoulders with a few strands framing her face.

Apa wrapped his arm around his girlfriend and the loved-up couple beamed as they headed out of the festivities. KJ opened the car door to help Clara into the car as the two grinned at each other.

Taika Waititi also made an appearance at Sprouse's birthday gathering. The 45-year-old director donned a vintage t-shirt under a gray coat with cropped sleeves.

The Academy Award winner sported black jeans and white sneakers. He accessorized with a silver chain bracelet and a large silver watch.

Taika's girlfriend Rita Ora did not accompany him to the party. Last week, the new couple went public as they walked the red carpet together at The Suicide Squad premiere.

Earlier that day, Clara shared videos to her Instagram in which she and Apa joked around as they were being driven in a car.

In the first clip, Apa reached over from the backseat to playfully put his hand on Berry's forehead and pull her eyebrows up with two fingers as the two laughed.

'Good, good, good, good, good,' he could be heard saying as they cruised down a highway.

Clara then added a mustache filter in the next clip with the couple smiling as they wore bushy facial hair above their upper lips.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Changing people's minds is difficult, time-consuming and tiring, says Dr Max (pictured)

Changing people’s minds is difficult, time-consuming and tiring. Many of my patients think self-harm, drugs or alcohol are the answers to their problems.

In treating depression and anxiety we have to coax them away from such negative or anxious beliefs. The gains aren’t consistent and there are plenty of setbacks, but it’s something that, as a psychiatrist, I undertake on a daily basis.

However, gently guiding a patient to change is different to attempting it with a friend.

This is precisely the problem I’ve been facing over the past few months with a friend I’ll call Darren, who has been sucked into the anti-vaxxer quagmire.

It’s difficult to ignore the issue as he posts stuff on social media and talks about it constantly when we meet up. Several people have suggested I stop speaking to him. This is what actress Jennifer Aniston has done — she’s said she has cut off anyone in her friendship circle who has refused the Covid jab.

Personally, I think this is a mistake, particularly if you really care about ensuring people get vaccinated.

I’ve been horrified to see some doctors post mocking, spiteful or sanctimonious comments about anti-vaxxers. Do they really think being unpleasant to people or laughing at them is going to change their minds? Every single piece of research into behaviour change tells us this won’t work. Quite the opposite — it causes the anti-vaxxers to become more emphatic.

Darren has some truly bonkers theories. As someone who has not only seen the devastating effects of Covid first hand but also cares passionately about evidence and science, I find his conspiracy theories and utter misunderstanding of basic science — let alone immunology and microbiology — deeply frustrating. I’d actually border on finding it insulting and offensive. But what good would cutting him out do? We should be able to tolerate different views voiced by the people in our lives. I also believe isolating these people guarantees they never change.

Our beliefs tend to be astonishingly entrenched. There’s good evolutionary reason for this — we are bombarded with information, much of which is contradictory, so if we kept changing our mind on things, life would feel chaotic and decision-making insurmountable.

So how do we bring people like Darren round? Research into how to engage anti-vaxxers suggests there will always be a hardcore group who are so resistant to change it’s simply not worth trying. Their conspiracies are often serving a deep-rooted psychological need.

I read recently about a man whose son had died in 9/11. He had become a conspiracy theorist about the attacks and it absolutely consumed his life. It became clear that this was all bound up in his grief — a way that he could understand and explain his son’s death. You have no hope of changing this man’s view unless you can understand and provide something that can replace the need it is fulfilling.

It will be the same with some anti-vaxxers. But Darren doesn’t fall into this group. I think he’s just misguided. He dropped out of school before GCSEs so has limited understanding of science. He gets his news and views from social media. He’s had run-ins with the authorities, so tends to be wary of people in charge.

But he's horrified to see some doctors post mocking remarks about anti-vaxxers (stock photo of a person having a jab)

You can see how all this makes him susceptible to anti-vaxxer nonsense.

But the worst thing to do would be to say he is stupid or wrong.

For me to say that as a doctor would be even worse — although we’re old and close friends, I represent the medical establishment and am therefore someone not to be trusted. So, far from lecturing him, I have embarked on several long, fun dinners where I listen to him. I want to understand what he is basing his beliefs on.

He isn’t convinced by all the anti-vax arguments. I make it clear I agree when he mentions the myths he doesn’t believe. This shows him I’m listening and forges a sense that he isn’t wrong about everything. He is worried about his immune system being overwhelmed. He thinks there is mercury in the vaccines. He believes they have been rushed. On some points I correct him, but mostly I just listen.

Over a few months, I gently try to educate him about science in general, so he has the tools to challenge the anti-vaxxer ideas himself. I steer the conversation on to the immune system. He’s into fitness so I use this as an ‘in’, discussing the impact of exercise on the immune system.

After many dinners, drinks and texts, eventually, bingo! He mentions a story he has read about an anti-vaxxer dying of Covid.

This allows me to tell him about people I’ve seen who have died. He really cares about mental health, so I emphasise the impact lockdown has had on this aspect of people’s lives, and that we have to do everything we can to avoid another one. He’s patriotic, so I talk in terms of the vaccination being a duty: any side-effects are a sacrifice we should make for the greater good.

During this process he moves house and doesn’t have wifi for about six weeks: I think a break from social media helps to de-condition him. It allows my ideas to germinate in his mind.

And then, two weeks ago he mentions, in a text about something entirely different, that he has had his first jab. Now I just need to get him to have his second.

Girls outperformed boys again in this year’s GCSEs. Females in general also live longer and have lower rates of drug and alcohol addiction.

Their cancers get more funding and they are less likely to be murdered or kill themselves. It seems the odds are increasingly stacked against men, yet voicing this risks opprobrium.

My fears for Tilly on Strictly

Gordon Ramsay’s daughter Tilly (pictured together) has joined Strictly, at the age of 19

Gordon Ramsay’s daughter Tilly has joined Strictly, at the age of 19. No doubt her friends are congratulating her on landing a high-profile gig. But I worry about her.

While she has a big social media following, her major claim to fame is her father and I wonder how prepared she is for the glare of the spotlight?

The scrutiny at such a young age is merciless, particularly when you can’t carefully curate and control what people see — as she will be able to do on her social media.

Fame is intoxicating but fickle and the industry is cut-throat and merciless. It spits people out when they have served their purpose. Depending on the reflected glory of her dad makes her time in the spotlight all the more fragile.

Thomas Markle has said he will take his daughter Meghan to court in order to see his grandchildren. Quite right — grandparents deserve access to their grandchildren just as a parent does, and children should have the right to see their grandparents.

Too often in family feuds this important relationship is overlooked. Grandparents are a connection to the past. They make us feel grounded, offer reassurance and help us develop a sense of belonging.

Yet grandparents still have no rights in the UK. They can be cut out without any consideration. How is this right?

Dr Max prescribes... A fun musical

'Last week I went to see Anything Goes (pictured) at the Barbican in London. If you can, do go', said Dr Max

Last week I went to see Anything Goes at the Barbican in London. If you can, do go. Yes, the performers are wonderful and clearly delighted to finally be back to work after so much uncertainty.

But for me the real buzz came from the audience. The sense of pure joy from the auditorium was electrifying: I’ve never felt so much energy, bordering on hysteria.

Despite it being a comedy, the woman next to me was in floods of tears — she explained it was simply because she was sitting in the theatre and enjoying herself so much. Book your own ticket now!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2016, there were 11million people over the age of 65 in this country. By 2030, Government statisticians think that number will hit 16million, almost a quarter of the total predicted population.

Not all these older folk will retire immediately but many will, and even those who do not are likely to work less as they cruise towards full retirement.

Everyone, however, will need money to live so the pressure is on to start saving for later life as early as possible.

Many astute savers use independent financial advisers to help them make the right choices.

Growth: Tatton Asset Management works exclusively for independent financial advisers

And these advisers are increasingly turning to investment platforms – online services that allow users to buy, sell and hold shares and funds.

Individual savers use the likes of Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell, but others are specifically targeted towards advisers.

According to recent figures, advisers hold around £650billion of their customers' money on platforms and the figure is expected to grow to £1trillion by 2025.

Tatton Asset Management is neatly placed to benefit from this trend. The group works exclusively for independent financial advisers, helping them to create investment portfolios that suit their customers' needs and sit on digital platforms.

The company is growing fast, chief executive Paul Hogarth is highly ambitious and the shares, at £4.95, should go far.

Hogarth has spent more than three decades in financial services, mostly focused on supporting financial advisers. Having founded his first business, Bankhall, in the 1980s he built it up, sold it on and founded another company,

Paradigm, just before the financial crisis. Paradigm helps advisers to ensure they are compliant with all the latest regulations.

The firm quickly developed a name for top service and over the years, advisers began asking Hogarth if he could do more to help them.

In 2013, he responded by setting up Tatton Asset Management, folding Paradigm into the business but adding a new layer – a range of different investment portfolios that advisers can offer to their customers.

Today, Tatton works with more 650 financial advisers who between them have some 70,000 end-customers.

By 2030, Government statisticians think there will be 16million people over the age of 65

These savers can choose from around 45 different portfolios, catering for almost every kind of investment need from ultra-cautious to super-adventurous, with a number of green options thrown in for good measure.

Known as model or managed portfolio services, these investment collections provide elements of bespoke management but at a cut-price rate.

Headquartered in Wilmslow, Cheshire, Tatton was the cheapest on the market back in 2013 and remains highly competitive to this day. Importantly too, the group delivers robust, above-average investment returns and decent service.

The combination has helped Hogarth expand the company consistently over the years, offering rising dividends to shareholders along the way.

Looking ahead, Hogarth intends to go even further, taking assets under management to £15billion over the next three years, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.

Several deals are in the pipeline and, such is Tatton's reputation that most followers believe the group will easily reach its £15billion target and almost certainly exceed it in the coming years.

The more advisers that Tatton works with and the more of their clients' money that it looks after, the more profitable it should become.

Brokers predict revenues will increase 10 per cent to £25.7million in the year to March 2022, with profits growing from £11.2million to £12.3million. The following year, a 15 per cent increase in profits is forecast, to £14.2million.

Hogarth is the biggest shareholder in Tatton, with an 18 per cent stake in the company. Not only is he motivated to succeed but he also recognises the importance of dividends.

Payments increased almost 15 per cent to 11p in the year to March 2021, even as multiple companies cut or reduced their dividends. Further increases are pencilled in for this year and beyond.

Midas verdict: Tatton is a well-run business in a growing market. The group has made strong progress in recent years, the pace of growth is accelerating and Hogarth's own stake provides reassurance. At £4.95, the shares are a buy.

In this podcast special, Lee is joined from Los Angeles by his co-author, Storage Hunters TV star Jesse McClure, to explain all to Georgie Frost and Simon Lambert.

Jesse and Lee discuss how they met, how the book was created, and their three step approach to putting more money in your pocket with a little bit of entrepreneurial endeavour and reselling.

The book is broken down into three parts: how to build up a cash pot, learning the resale blueprint and investing the pot for resale profits.

Step one is all about properly selling items in your home, making cash legitimately – and safely – online, and even making money from stuff you might think is trash. This is good both for your wallet and the environment.

Step two sees Jesse outline some of the tips and tricks he uses everyday as a professional buyer and seller, while step three is all about hunting down spots to buy items to make even bigger profits – from car boots, to charity shops.

While it won't make you a millionaire overnight, the pair believe it can be a great hobby, a way to stay afloat, or to set the foundations to becoming a professional at it.

The authors also share some of Jesse's big wins and tips for getting started straightaway.

This week, Simon Lambert, Lee Boyce and Georgie Frost ask whether this is really a possibility, if banking actually is free anyway and what happens next.

We also look at who is winning the battle of current account switchers and whether people are just too loyal to their bank.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The threat of negative interest rates is looming large for savers.

This week, a government bond auction saw UK gilts sold at a negative rate for the first time, while Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey refused to rule out the base rate flipping below zero.

But could you end up with a negative rate on your savings account?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert, Lee Boyce and Georgie Frost look at the weird world of negative rates – an upside down where investors effectively pay to lend the government money, banks are charged interest for depositing funds with the Bank of England, and you’d end up being stung rather than rewarded for saving.

Not that there’s much reward for saving in many places right now: a This is Money investigation this week revealed that 235 savings accounts now pay 0.01 per cent interest.

That is 10p per year on £1,000 saved and some may prefer not to be insulted in that way and have their bank or building society join the six accounts where absolutely zero is paid.

The best accounts pay just over 1 per cent and while that’s not much, at least savers are getting a real return on their money, with inflation at 0.8 per cent.

But another warning has been sounded and it’s that the end game of through-the-looking-glass monetary policy could be inflation soaring. The team look at what the argument is and whether it stacks up.

The base rate is at 0.1 per cent (and could go negative) and bond yields are on the floor, because of the economic destruction of the coronavirus crisis.

The furlough scheme is one of Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s flagship efforts to combat this, but another This is Money investigation this week revealed companies that have taken advantage of the taxpayer’s offer to pay 80 per cent of their staff’s wages are now threatening to make them redundant anyway.

And finally, on a lighter note, if you’re feeling brave then you might decide now is the time to buy a home, while house prices and confidence have taken a knock, but is the estate agent allowed to tell you what others have offered?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The sun is shining (finally) and holidays abroad are back on the agenda. But with Covid cases rising, testing chaos and ministers still changing guidance at a moment's notice, travelling overseas has never been trickier.

It's why it has become all the more important to invest in a comprehensive travel insurance policy that will pay out in the event something doesn't go to plan.

Yet even buying holiday cover is proving to be a headache.

Travel insurance searches were up 191 per cent between June and July, while the cost of cover has crept up 4 per cent, according to comparison site MoneySuperMarket.

Travel insurance searches were up 191% between June and July, while cost of cover is up 4%

But sun seekers are being urged to tread carefully.

Some insurers will not pay out for anything related to the virus, while those that do claim to offer Covid cover may have costly exclusions buried in the terms and conditions.

In fact, as our table shows, there is not a single policy that will pay out for every scenario that could jeopardise your trip.

And with the average policy document running to 32 pages, or 22,500 words, according to consumer group Fairer Finance, it can be easy to get caught out.

So if you are hoping to get away this summer, here's our must-read guide to navigating the travel insurance minefield . . .

Heading to an amber-list country

If you are booked to travel to a destination on the Government's amber list, your first step is to check the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) website.

This is separate to the Government's traffic light system, and you may find it still advises against all but essential travel to some amber-list countries, such as Italy.

Checking is crucial because travel insurers do not typically reference the traffic light system in their policies.

Instead, they focus on whether or not the FCDO recommends travel to a country — and most will not cover you if a warning is still in place.

However some insurers are offering add-on cover for this scenario.

Staysure and Avanti both offer a European FCDO Travel Advice Extension.

On top of the typical insurance for lost belongings and medical emergencies, you will also benefit from additional Covid cover.

This includes up to £1,000 of cover for travel or accommodation expenses if an incident relating to Covid means you are advised to return home early from European destinations, plus Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt.

It will also cover medical bills if you get Covid-19 while abroad, and pay for cancelled trips if a relative or someone you live with is hospitalised with Covid.

Prices for the add-on starts at around £5, although Staysure says 74 per cent of customers pay less than this.

Staysure and Avanti also cover cancellations if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate meaning you cannot travel.

It will not pay out if the country you are visiting goes into lockdown or Government advice changes.

Another provider, Battleface, also offers travel insurance for FCDO 'Non Essential' destinations worldwide.

Sanctioned countries such as Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Crimea, South Sudan and Venezuela are excluded.

It will also cover medical expenses for policyholders aged 59 or under if they catch Covid.

But it will not pay out for trip cancellations, curtailment of a holiday, self-isolation or lockdown restrictions.

A policy for a couple in their 40s visiting Greece for a week would cost around £48.

A travel insurance policy backed by the British Insurance Brokers Association (Biba), and available through its 1,800 members, is also offering Enhanced Covid-19 Cover for those who are travelling to Europe.

You will be covered if you are travelling somewhere the FCDO advises against all but essential travel, and you have had both jabs.

The policy, with Jackson Lee Underwriting (JLU), covers medical expenses if you get Covid abroad, and cancellation costs if you are told to self-isolate by Test and Trace or have an adverse reaction to the vaccine.

However, you will not be covered if lockdown restrictions mean you cannot travel or the Government advice changes and you decide to cancel your trip.

A handful of other insurers, such as Axa and Cedartree, say they will also cover you if you travel against FCDO advice, but Covid-related claims may be excluded.

Cancellations: Not all airlines and travel firms will allow customers to move their trip fee-free, so it may be worth checking a policy ensures you will not be left out of pocket if you can't go

Those last minute changes to rules

If you are travelling to a country that has been given the green light by the FCDO, you have a much greater choice of cover.

Most will cover any medical expenses should you catch the virus while on holiday.

But you will need to check the small print carefully as you may not be protected for every Covid-related crisis.

Providers with five-star Covid cover include AA, Avanti, EasyJet and Saga, according to consumer group Fairer Finance.

However there could still be gaps in your cover. The most common exclusions include:

Cancellations because your destination has gone into lockdown;

A household member catches coronavirus and you are unable to travel;

A close relative dies or is hospitalised with the virus;

Extra costs for food or accommodation if you catch Covid abroad and have to extend your trip.

James Daley, from Fairer Finance, says: 'The truth is that there are enormous variation across the policies on offer. Many will cover certain events relating to Covid but not all.

'For example, only around one in four policies will cover you if the person you're going to stay with gets Covid or is ordered to self-isolate. So it really is a minefield right now.'

One of the most sought-after types of cover is for cancellations in the event the Government suddenly changes its travel advice.

As we saw with France at the weekend, rules can change overnight — and if you have a job where you cannot isolate on your return, a policy that will pay out in this instance is worth its weight in gold.

Not all airlines and travel firms will allow customers to move their trip fee-free, and this cover ensures you will not be left out of pocket if you can't go.

Aviva says its travel disruption cover will pay out for cancellations if FCDO advice changes within 31 days of departure and you have travel disruption cover.

It will cover you if the FCDO advice changes and you have to come home, but only if you have a return flight booked. You cannot make a claim if FCDO advice was in place at the time you booked your trip or purchased the insurance — whichever is later.

You are covered if the UK goes into lockdown before your holiday, if there were no Government or local lockdown restrictions in place, or announced, when you took out the cover or booked your trip — whatever you did last.

It will also consider claims if you test positive for coronavirus or are advised to self-isolate by Track and Trace or receive a notification from the NHS app.

A couple in their 40s would pay around £66 for a single trip policy if they were to travel to Spain in August and stay for a week.

Providers with five star Covid cover include AA, Avanti, EasyJet and Saga, research shows

Grounded by the pingdemic

There are around 30 to 40 policies on the market that currently offer cover if you cannot travel because you are told to self-isolate by Test and Trace, according to Which?.

But holidaymakers should double check this also includes cover if you are pinged by the NHS app, as unlike Test and Trace, advice to self-isolate is guidance rather than law.

The AA, Aviva and AllClear say they will all cover you for cancellations in both instances.

If you are pinged by the app or notified by Test and Trace, you are covered by both AXA and Cedar Tree, regardless of what tier of cover you pay for.

These policies will also cover your medical bills if you catch Covid while overseas, except where customers have travelled against FCDO advice where cover may be restricted.

With Cedartree, a couple in their 40s would pay between £20.50 and £36.50 for a single trip policy for a week in Spain. But you will not be covered if the Government advice changes and you need to cancel.

If you are already abroad when the advice changes, the policy will pay for lost holiday days if you have to return early.

Banking on peace of mind

There are two travel insurance policies that offer 'complete cover', according to Which?

This is its top rating and cover includes medical bills if you catch Covid abroad as well as cancellation if FCDO advice changes, you are told to self-isolate or catch Covid before you travel.

But you will need to open a bank account with Barclays or HSBC first — and there could still be some small print that may trip you up.

Barclays' Travel Pack costs £12.50 a month, and you must hold it for at least six months.

The travel policy, provided by Aviva, will cover you, a partner if you live with them, and dependent children travelling with you if they are under 23. You and your partner must be aged 79 or under.

You will not be covered for cancellations if the FCDO had advised against non-essential travel when you booked or bought the policy based on the last purchase.

You will also not be covered if restrictions were put in place before you left and you later cut your holiday short.

Your cover could be impacted if you have had a previous Covid infection and Barclays has excluded it.

Barclays says as standard there is no cover for any claims caused by an existing medical condition unless confirmed otherwise.

HSBC Select And Cover starts at £19.50 a month and you will benefit from at least three insurance policies, including travel if you choose.

The policy will pay out if the country you are travelling to unexpectedly moves to the red list and you need to return early.

You will also be covered for cancellations if FCDO advice changes after you have booked your trip, and if you cannot travel because you have to self-isolate or the country you are visiting goes into lockdown.

But you cannot claim if you want to cancel because the Government brings in quarantine rules for when you are due to return — as we saw with France last weekend.

Customers are also only eligible for cover up to the age of 70 and must be registered for online banking.

And finally, a note of caution

Travellers should beware buying multiple policies to ensure they are covered for all eventualities, because doubling up on cover could backfire.

Anna-Marie Duthie, from ratings site Defaqto, says: 'Even if you only claim on one policy, you must notify the insurer if you have other policies that cover the same risks.

'That insurer may then only pay a share of the claim and could in some cases refuse to let you claim at all.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@My parents booked a family cruise with P&O through a local travel agent, PST Travel - 19 of us were due to go in August 2020 to celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary and my father's 90th birthday.

The cruise, which cost £17,124.74, was postponed for a year and then cancelled due to Covid. While P&O have returned £10,750, they still awaiting the further £6,374.74.

The travel agent says it has paid P&0 but it claims to have only received 60 per cent of the funds and hence won't repay the balance.

This has been going back and forth for months, even though the cruise was cancelled by P&0 in March 2021.

One family was due to go on a cruise on the IONA but is now struggling to get a full refund

Until my parents are reimbursed the full amount, we can't rebook a revised cruise and they might not have that many years left to cruise comfortably and enjoy what should be a fantastic two milestones.

Why are they having to wait so long for a refund and what can we do to speed up the process? P.N., via email

Grace Gausden, consumer expert at This is Money, replies: The customer service you received from P&O Cruises and the travel agent certainly did not float your boat.

It was due to be a once in a lifetime family cruise to celebrate your parents anniversary and your father's 90th birthday - you say they saved up for years to put aside the £17,000 needed.

The cruise was meant to be around the Norwegian Fjords on the IONA, a brand new ship whose build has been delayed due to Covid – hence why the trip was rescheduled to August 2021 initially before being cancelled.

GRACE ON THE CASE Our weekly column sees This is Money consumer expert Grace Gausden tackles reader problems and shines the light on companies doing both good and bad. Want her to investigate a problem, or do you want to praise a firm for going that extra mile? Get in touch: grace.gausden@thisismoney.co.uk

Your mother, who is 84, booked the cruise via a local travel agent, PST Travel, which is part of the Global Travel chain, paying the £17,215 in instalments for all 19 family members.

On 4 March 2021, the cruise was cancelled, and this started the long process of your parents, and you, chasing their refund.

After much back and forth, P&O started to send refunds in various amounts to eight members of the family totalling £10,750 in May.

This seemed very odd as your parents had paid the full amount with family members not chipping in at all.

However, they did all return the cheques to your parents who duly cashed them in – deciding not to return them to P&O and wait for the full amount as this was not forthcoming.

Despite this, P&O eventually said they refuse to pay any more as they can't find the funds on their computer.

Meanwhile, Global Travel claim it has paid P&O the full amount and sent evidence of this but the agent is struggling to get the cruise company to reply to emails and phone calls and to reimburse the funds.

You are concerned that if your parents do not rebook soon, they may be too elderly to travel

Until your parents are reimbursed the full amount, you are unable to rebook a revised cruise.

You say that time is of the essence due to their age, adding to the stress of the situation.

You have also experienced problems with getting P&0 to allocate the Future Cruise Credit to your booking.

This is for all guests who have had their cruise cancelled and essentially means the amount you have already paid which can be redeemed against any new booking.

However, P&O said it would only apply this on the funds it had received from the agent, not on the full cruise cost - meaning you would lose out on thousands of pounds worth of credit.

You say the firm were not interested in offering a similar cruise in return and instead hiked the prices by 25 per cent and insisting only the amount paid would be kept as a credit.

Therefore you opted for a refund and are now waiting for your parents to be repaid the £6,465.

I contacted P&O to find out why it was not returning the funds to the customer, stressing the importance of the trip due to the age of those booking.

Fortunately, it seemed to understand and decided to refund you the £6,465 straightaway. However, it does still claim it has not received the funds from PST Travel.

A P&O spokesperson said: 'We are extremely sorry to hear about this family's experience. We are yet to receive all payment due for their holiday from their booking agent.

'We want to bring this matter to a swift and positive conclusion for the family. Therefore, P&O Cruises will be refunding the money owed then retrospectively seeking our outstanding monies from their booking agent.

'We really hope that the family comes and travels with us at a future time.'

Without the full refund, your elderly parents do not have enough money to rebook the cruise

A spokesperson for PST Travel added: 'We are only too well aware of this booking and have every sympathy with the family over the very protracted delay in securing her refund which in our view has been totally unacceptable.

'Clearly this delay should never have happened and we believe it has been primarily an administrative/accounting mis-communication which has been compounded by the difficulties in contacting P&O and actually getting someone to act.

'From our point of view as agents, we have been doing everything possible to bring this to a conclusion and it is no exaggeration to say that if we charged for time as solicitors, we would be well into four figures which of course could never be charged to a client in any event.

'Whilst one can sympathise with the huge costs that have been incurred by the cruise companies, they are not helping their passengers or us as agents in taking protracted time to respond to any query – emails can be around two weeks and waiting time on the telephone can be up to an hour.'

Although P&O wasn't ferry impressive, hopefully now you can rebook the cruise as soon as possible with your parents and manage to get that once in a lifetime trip in.

One consumer found a courier had spilt red paint at the front of his house after a delivery

Hit and miss: This week's naughty and nice list

Each week, I look at some of the companies that have fallen short of expected standards as well as those that have gone that extra mile for customers.

Miss: In not such positive news, this week reader Max, got in touch about courier, XDP.

He said: 'XDP couriers spilt a tin of red paint in front of our house in December last year - it looked like the scene of a murder.

'They were delivering some items from Wayfair but must have spilled someone else's delivery of paint.

'After we complained, the firm appeared to accept liability, directly acknowledging the paint was still visible and passing me over to their insurers.

'However, it then went back on this saying it had already cleaned it and therefore accepts no liability as there's no paint to clean up.

'They made no such attempt and I have indisputable proof the courier has lied multiple times. I have 24/7 security camera footage from multiple angles available showing the paint spill.'

I contacted XDP as there is still very clearly a large, red, paint stain outside your home with video evidence proving it was the couriers who caused the spill.

Whilst XDP said it wouldn't be able to comment, you advised me that not long after I spoke to the firm, you were contacted to say it would now be prepared to pay the £677.18 cleaning bill.

Although XDP haven't painted themselves in the best light, at least you will not have to look at the red stain for much longer.

One consumer praised the customer service he received at the BA check in desk at Heathrow

Hit: In good news this week, reader Viv, praised bathroom firm, Croydex, for their speedy customer service.

She said: 'We purchased a shower caddy in 2019 with a five year anti corrosion guarantee.

'However it became rusty, so I emailed and sent photographs of the unit plus my purchase receipt and within about four days we received a replacement item.'

Good to hear a company being showered in praise.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A UN report describes the threat of global warming as ‘unprecedented’ and warns that heatwaves, floods and drought will be more frequent and intense in the next 20 years.

And homes account for 15 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, official statistics reveal, with 19 million below a ‘C’ in their Energy Performance Certificates — the Government’s rating for homes.

‘Climate change will affect future mortgage applications,’ says David McGrail of First Mortgage. ‘When you consider subsidence can knock 20 per cent off a home’s value — about £50,000 of the average price — it can have an impact, and make you more at risk of negative equity.’

Climate fight: Homes account for 15 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, statistics reveal, yet 19 million in Britain fall below a ‘C’ in the Government's Energy Performance Certificates

Some new homes are ahead of the game. But if you have an older home, there’s still plenty you can do to save energy — and money. Here’s how . . .

Improve insulation

Poor insulation leads to 45 per cent of heat loss. Cavity wall insulation stores heat within inner walls, while loft insulation sits between joists.

You can have floor insulation, too. Some homes will be eligible for the Energy Company Obligation grant. See powercompare.co.uk.

Cost? This varies, depending on house size, but £500 to £1,000 is a good start. Consumer body Which? and the Energy Saving Trust calculate you could pay for it with reduced energy bills after five years.

Save with solar

Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, that is stored and used in your home. It cuts power bills and some people even sell ‘spare’ electricity to the National Grid under the Smart Export Guarantee tariffs scheme.

Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, that is stored and used in your home. It cuts power bills and some people even sell ‘spare’ electricity to the National Grid

A south-facing roof is best, unshaded by buildings between 10am and 4pm to get the maximum solar rays.

Cost? Typically about £5,000. It may take 20 years or even more to recoup its cost in electricity bill savings at existing rates.

Go for glazing

Double or triple glazing will help cut energy bills, but if the windows are south facing they may magnify the effect of sunshine, and overheat a room.

No more than double glazing is advised if a room is in direct sunlight for many hours a day.

Cost? Website Double Glazing On The Web says triple glazing a two-bedroom home would cost £2,000 on average and up to £7,000 for a larger house. Double glazing can cost up to 70 per cent of that.

Low-energy lighting

Replacing all bulbs in your home with LED lights could cut carbon dioxide emissions by 75 per cent. Over a year that’s the equivalent of a car being driven 140 miles. It’s now illegal to make halogen lights but old stock can still be sold and the bulbs are found in ovens, cooker hoods and security lights. Try to avoid these.

Cost? LED bulbs typically last three times longer than traditional bulbs.

Upgrade your boiler

The older the boiler, the less efficient it is; if yours is rated D, E, F or G (as opposed to higher-rated A, B or C) then a new one could save you substantial sums and give off less carbon dioxide.

Cost? For a new boiler, expect to pay £2,500 to £3,500. See which.co.uk.

Pump it up

Ground source heat pumps are pipes buried in the garden to extract heat, which is then circulated into the house for radiators, underfloor systems and water.

Cost? The Energy Saving Trust says a ground source heat pump can cost £10,000 to £18,000.

Savings depend on what existing energy supply is being replaced. You could save £1,050 a year on average if you currently rely on old storage heaters.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Talks to get the US investment giant Apollo on board to finance a bid to buy Morrisons have cooled after a shock increase in the offer price earlier this month.

New York-based Apollo had been lined up to join a takeover consortium led by the private equity firm Fortress.

But market sources this weekend said they believed Apollo had baulked at the dramatic £400million price increase for the supermarket chain.

Fortress increased its offer from £6.3billion to £6.7billion nine days ago in a highly unusual pre-emptive strike to gazump its rival Clayton Dubilier & Rice, advised by former Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy.

Bad connection: New York-based Apollo had been lined up to join a takeover consortium led by the private equity firm Fortress

CD&R had apparently been scrambling to put together a counter offer before Fortress increased its price.

It has until this Friday to respond to the raised offer after applying to the Takeover Panel for more time.

CD&R is understood to still be working towards the possibility of a knockout counter bid – which would force Fortress back to the drawing board.

Fortress, which is owned by the Japanese investment company SoftBank, has joined forces with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Koch family – US billionaires known for their conservative activism.

Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, also joined the consortium late last month, providing the Fortress consortium with extra firepower.

It was not clear this weekend whether a deal with Apollo would be reached.

The fund giant had initially looked at making its own offer for Morrisons before it was revealed last month that it might join the Fortress consortium. Other sources said Apollo could yet join the bid.

In June, CD&R offered £5.5billion for Morrisons, but this was flatly refused by the board, which includes two former colleagues of Leahy.

Andy Higginson, former finance chief at Tesco, is chairman and Morrisons chief executive David Potts was once considered to be a possible successor to Leahy when the retailer-turned-investment adviser signalled his intention to leave the retailer in 2010.

Shareholders initially rounded on the decision to sell to Fortress at its opening price of £2.54 a share.

Investor JO Hambro called on suitors to pay £2.70 while M&G said the offer price did not reflect 'the true value' of the company.

Its largest shareholder Silchester – with a 15 per cent stake – had said it was 'not inclined to support' the lower price. It has so far not commented on the raised offer.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ambitious carpet and flooring supplier Likewise Group will this week list on AIM with a plan to triple sales.

The firm has agreed to raise £10million from investors, valuing it at £50 million, to fund growth and distribution centres across the UK.

Likewise is run by Tony Brewer, who for 16 years ran flooring supply giant Headlam, which has a current market value of £436million.

Roll with it: Likewise has agreed to raise £10million from investors, valuing it at £50 million, to fund growth and distribution centres across the UK

Likewise supplies independent retailers in the highly fragmented market, which is still dominated by 7,000 or so small, family-run operations.

Brewer said Likewise planned to grow its share of the £2billion-a-year market from 3 per cent to 10 per cent – equivalent to sales of about £200 million a year.

He said independents often sell and fit carpets and still thrive in a market where advice and understanding the technical specifications of products help customers decide which to buy.

'There's little or no barrier to setting up [a shop] in this market and with our help it can be made very easy,' he said.

Brewer has attracted several other former Headlam employees to work for him, including his finance director and commercial director.

The sale of shares dilutes his family stake in the business to about 25 per cent.

'Constantly and fearlessly challenging convention, her four decades of music are not only an extraordinary body of work, but a playbook for creative and cultural evolution.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When a Thatcherite purist such as Nigel Vinson, stalwart of the free market Institute of Economic Affairs, loudly opposes a private equity takeover of Bradford-based supermarket chain Morrisons, you wonder why the Iron Lady’s disciples are not of the same mind.

Not a peep has so far been heard from Chancellor Rishi Sunak, a laissez-faire thinker who represents a Yorkshire constituency in Morrisons territory.

As for Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, author of the volume Thatcher’s Trial, he purred with support for the £6.7billion takeover offer from Fortress after reassurances from the supermarket group’s chairman Andy Higginson.

Among the puzzles about the bidding shoot-out for Morrisons is that it is between two overseas-controlled entities. No one has come up with a home-based solution

One cannot imagine Margaret Thatcher falling for the soft-soap without asking forensic questions and making sure commitments made in the heat of a merger battle are legally enforceable.

Among the puzzles about the bidding shoot-out for Morrisons is that it is between two overseas-controlled entities, Softbank-backed Fortress and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). No one has come up with a home-based solution.

One City veteran suggested that a good combination for Morrisons would be with Sainsbury’s, bringing together its strengths in the South with Morrisons’ northern footprint.

But it would be a case of once bitten, twice shy for Sainsbury’s after its previous merger proposal with Asda was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority.

If that wouldn’t work then a different type of high street deal might. A merger between M&S and Morrisons might be good sense.

Both pride themselves on food quality. Morrisons’ fresh produce, from its own fishing fleet to its cheese production, is outstanding. It does some of its online deliveries on the jointly owned M&S-Ocado channel.

Even more radical would be for the UK’s most successful clothing and home products retailer, Next, run by the shrewd Simon Wolfson, to acquire or merge with Morrisons, giving it a quality stake in food.

It shows a lack of imagination and ambition, by all these entities, that they are happy to stand by and watch private equity plunder Morrisons rather than take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape their enterprises.

One cannot imagine some of the retail giants of the past such as Geoff Mulcahy, creator of Kingfisher, or James ‘retail is detail’ Gulliver, boss of Fine Fare and Safeway, standing on the sidelines.

Sinking funds

This ought to be a golden era for UK fund managers. As occupants of one of the world’s great financial hubs, they ought to be attracting vast inflows while equity markets boom around the globe.

But Abrdn (the old Aberdeen Standard Life) and M&G are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Giants such as Blackrock, Fidelity and Vanguard have been attracting vast inflows.

Managers with big reputations, such as Schroders and Goldman Sachs, prosper along with platforms catering for private investors.

There are signs in the latest financial results that both firms are regaining their mojo. Abrdn was a pioneer in investing in Asia and chief executive Stephen Bird is seeking to regain that territory through a distribution agreement with Citi.

It wants to soup up its private investor offering by acquiring AI digital innovator Exo and is making a big play for ESG.

The numbers are starting to improve, with outflows down to £8.3billion, against £26.8billion in the first half of last year. And it is displacing lower income older assets with newer mandates with higher performance fees.

John Foley, at M&G, has been swimming against the tide too but has managed to harvest European institutional clients, and netted a modest £2.2billion net inflow.

The rate of net retail outflows has slowed and there is hope its PruFund Planet, addressing green and social issues, will be a crowd-pleaser.

Both firms have a chance for a big say in the outcome of the current private equity crapshoot. They should fly the flag for UK defence, grocery and health products rather than take the cash and run.

Winner takes all

For investors willing to back UK-quoted gambling giants the returns can be spectacular.

A headstart online pushed up revenue at Paddy Power-owner Flutter by 59pc. Shares of Ladbrokes owner Entain have soared 150 per cent in the last month on optimism of the return of an all-out bid from MGM.

As Euro 2020 bettors learned to their cost: the bookie always wins.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Underpaid state pensions, the reopening of the property market and whether house prices will fall and the furlough scheme extension, feature on this week's podcast.

A This is Money investigation has revealed a string of women who have been underpaid their state pension, but are they just the tip of an iceberg?

On this week’s podcast, our pensions agony uncle Steve Webb and pension and investing editor Tanya Jefferies tell the stories of the women paid thousands less in state pension over the years than they should have been - and discuss their probe into the matter.

Steve estimates that there could be tens of thousands of women who have been underpaid state pension.

This is Money has called for a full review, but the Department of Work and Pensions is reluctant to act other than on a case-by-case basis.

Should more be done?

Also, on this week’s podcast Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost discuss the reopening of the property market, who might be brave enough to buy and sell now, and what the forecasts are for sales and house prices.

Estate agents Knight Frank predict a 7 per cent drop, while the Bank of England says property prices may fall 16 per cent, but agents claim that lockdown has created pent-up demand.

And, as the furlough scheme is extended, we look at the implications of 7.5million people having 80 per cent of their wages picked up by the state and how Britain weans itself off that.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The price of petrol has just soared to an eight-year high, but motorists can knock a tenner off the rising cost of filling up their car by scouting out the cheapest garages – and simply sticking to the speed limit.

Last month saw the biggest rise in the price of unleaded petrol since the start of the year – up more than 3p to an average of £1.35 a litre, according to motoring organisation, the RAC.

Diesel now costs an average of £1.37 a litre – up almost 3p compared since the start of last month.

With the average car having a 60-litre tank, it means a full tank will now cost more than £80.

Research has found that driving at 80mph uses up to 25% more fuel than motoring at 70mph

But how much motorists pay will vary on where they fill up.

Supermarkets are currently charging an average of just over £1.32 for a litre of unleaded petrol while motorway service stations can charge as much as £1.49.

This difference can add up to total savings on a full tank of £10.20.

Northern Ireland is the cheapest place to get petrol – on average just over £1.31 for a litre of unleaded. In contrast, London motorists stump up almost £1.36 a litre.

Rod Dennis, spokesman for the RAC, says: 'The price of petrol on the forecourt continues to rise as more motorists get back on the road as we come out of lockdown.

'With the supply of oil still limited, extra demand is pushing up prices. But by being canny, motorists might be able to soften the pain by shopping around.'

The RAC has a 'fuel watch' link on its website that shows the average cost on the forecourt. It points out that at the very least motorists should try to better this price.

There are also handy free phone apps, such as PetrolPrices, that allow motorists to browse a map and discover the best petrol prices nearby – or on a planned journey.

Another way of reducing fuel bills is to drive more smoothly. The difference between putting your foot down on the accelerator and adopting a smoother driving approach can reduce fuel consumption by a quarter.

The average distance covered by British motorists each year is 7,400 miles, according to data collector NimbleFins.

Northern Ireland is cheapest place to get petrol - costing just over £1.31 for a litre of unleaded

With a car doing 40 miles to the gallon (8.8 miles per litre), the annual unleaded petrol fuel bill would be around £1,135.

By adopting a more cautious driving style, a motorist could shave more than £280 off this annual bill.

Neil Greig, policy and research director at advanced motoring organisation IAM RoadSmart, says: 'Driving smoothly has a huge impact on fuel consumption. Motorists should try to give extra space to vehicles in front and anticipate traffic so they do not waste fuel in braking and accelerating up to other cars, junctions and traffic lights.

'This will instantly cut fuel consumption.'

Turning off the air conditioning and opening a window instead can also cut fuel consumption by five per cent – as can ensuring the tyres are properly pumped up and there is no unnecessary heavy baggage in the car.

Sticking to the speed limit also helps. Research by motor reviewer WhatCar? has found that driving at 80mph uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than motoring at 70mph.

With petrol prices so high, it is worth remembering that the lion's share of the price is taken by the Treasury.

For every litre purchased, nearly 58p goes straight to HM Revenue & Customs. Fuel also attracts VAT at 20 per cent.

It means more than 60 per cent of the price of a £1.35 litre of fuel goes on tax.

Crude oil prices fell to $31 a barrel in March last year, but are currently close to $70. Experts predict the price could soon break the $80 barrier.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I bought a van from a Renault garage and was quoted to pay £16,000 plus VAT, making it a total of £19,200.

Renault offered to pay £13,800 for my existing van, leaving me to pay £5,400 which I did so at the dealership.

However, within an hour of leaving, I received a call from the salesman informing me that he had undercharged me for the van and I still owed £2,300.

A Renault customer signed a contract and paid for a van but then was asked to pay more

I told him I would need to take advice before paying but he rang me back an hour later on his mobile saying the offer had been reduced to £1,700 and I had to pay or I would have to return the vehicle and take a refund.

Should I pay even though I had already signed the contract and paid the original asking price? J.R., via email

Grace Gausden, consumer expert at This is Money, replies: This situation almost drove you to despair after Renault tried to reverse the deal, even though you had already paid.

While looking for a replacement for your existing Renault Kangoo Formula Edition van, you contacted a number of dealerships before settling on a deal with Renault for a Kangoo Business+ edition as it was one of the better offers.

Overall, you would have to pay £5,400 after subtracting the £13,800 Renault would pay you for your van.

After agreeing to the deal, you were also made an offer of £13,500 by someone else looking to purchase your van.

However, as the dealership had offered you £300 more than the private sale, you decided to part exchange it.

Want her to investigate a problem, or do you want to praise a firm for going that extra mile? Get in touch: grace.gausden@thisismoney.co.uk

After paying the difference in the dealership as well as paying out for a road fund licence and private numberplate, you agreed you would pick up the van the next day.

But an hour after payment, a salesman from Renault rang you to say you had been undercharged and owed an additional £2,300 which understandably came as a shock.

You told the salesman you wanted to seek counsel about this but within the hour you had a further phone call, this time via the salesman's personal mobile.

He said he had made an error when adding up the price on your new van and had added VAT to the part exchange offer when the price should have not included the extra 20 per cent.

As such, while Renault originally were going to give you £13,800 inclusive of VAT on your van, they were now offering £11,500 - the price without VAT.

This left you owing them £7,700 overall - £5,400 of which you had already paid, meaning you needed to stump up an additional £2,300.

The salesman added he was in trouble with his boss and his job was on the line, putting added pressure on you to make the payment immediately.

You claim he said that Renault were prepared to take a hit on the deal and said they would settle for £1,700 or you could return the new vehicle and get a refund for the amount you had already paid.

What the reader paid What the original Renault contract said: Cost of van: £19,200 including VAT Part exchange price on your van: £13,800 including VAT Difference you paid: £5,400 What Renault then asked you to pay: Cost of van: £19,200 including VAT Part exchange price on your van: £11,500 not including VAT Difference to pay: £7,700 After the £5,400 you paid: £2,300 outstanding Amount reduced to £1,700: £5,400 plus £1,700 = £7,100.

The Renault customer was shocked when he was asked to pay even more for his new van

Again, you stated you would need time to think about this and would get back in touch.

Although Renault have reduced the amount, you feel that you have been misled by the French car manufacturer.

I could easily understand your frustration at being told to stump up thousands of pounds more after having already paid and signing the contract.

Therefore, I contacted Renault to see how this error had happened and how much you actually owed.

A spokesperson said: 'We are very disappointed to hear of Mr R's experience and apologise for the error.

'The mistake was due to the fact that the sales executive made a human error when calculating the VAT, therefore the dealership has rectified the mistake and taken on the loss.

'We apologise for the inconvenience caused.'

Fortunately, Renault said the dealership will take on the loss, meaning you now have your van and do not need to pay any more funds.

Shortly after you received a call from the salesman who had initially called you to say there was nothing else for you to pay, adding he had received a warning.

Luckily, Renault realised its mistake, and whilst mistakes do happen, you had already signed the contract and paid what you were asked to.

However, I imagine you are not in a rush to deal with the firm next time you are looking for a new vehicle.

An AA customer was shocked at the high price when she received her renewal quote

Hit and miss: This week's naughty and nice list

Each week, I look at some of the companies that have fallen short of expected standards as well as those that have gone that extra mile for customers.

Miss: This week, AA is under fire from reader, Sally, after she received a particularly high renewal quote.

She said: 'We have been a member of the AA for over 35 years but when our renewal quote came through it was £370.

'My husband looked online to join and the price for a new customer is £139. When he contacted the AA, it would only knock the premium down to £260.

'We have now had to cancel our membership and start all over again. Where is its customer loyalty service?'

I contacted AA about this to see why it was charging loyal customers nearly double what new customers had to pay.

However, AA refused to back down.

A spokesperson said: 'We believe all of our customers get a good deal at a fair price.

'We offer a market-leading breakdown service, which is rated in the highest possible way by customers, and our prices reflect the high quality of the service we provide.

'Like many providers and other subscription-based services, we do offer introductory discounts to encourage new customers to trial our services and we communicate these discounts at the point of purchase.

'We are grateful to Sally for her continued loyalty and are sorry that she was unhappy with her recent renewal quote. However, we are pleased to hear they remain happy with the service.'

It added that loyal customers receive extras such as, after the first year of breakdown cover, when members are given complimentary Silver benefits that are not available to new members and after five years, it provides further additional Gold benefits.

However, you say whilst you have these benefits, you would rather have a lower premium.

Sadly, you aren't the first to be hit by the loyalty penalty – and won't be the last. It's just a shame the AA didn't see fit to alter your premiums, leaving you to sign up again as new members.

Hit: In happier news, a reader, who wished to remain anonymous, got in touch to praise Marks & Spencer.

She said: 'I emailed M&S to say I was disappointed they only had granny-pant style bikini bottoms available with a bikini set I liked.

'They made me some bespoke bikini briefs to go with the set. Amazing customer service.'

M&S were certainly not pants in this situation and proved themselves by going the extra mile.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Romford has the highest rate of reported car thefts in the UK for a second year running, new research has revealed.

The 'RM' postcode has a car theft rate of 16.38 per 1,000 insurance enquiries in 2021 - an increase from 15.74 in 2020, according to data from Money Super Market and enough to top all other areas in the country.

Ilford and Barking were a close second with a rate of 15.71, again for a second consecutive year as thieves continue to target the same regions.

Hotspot: Romford is the place with the most car thefts in the UK for the second year in a row

Meanwhile, Dumfries and Galloway, located in Scotland's Western Southern Uplands, has the lowest rate of reported car thefts at 0.37 per 1,000 capita.

Money Super Market analysed millions of car insurance enquiries made on its site between 20 July 2020 and 20 July 2021 to identify the areas with the highest and lowest rates of reported car theft claims within a five-year period.

It found that Birmingham was the area with the third highest theft rate with 13.33 claims per 1,000 closely followed by North London with a rate of 12.61.

Enfield, Dudley and South West London also all made the list.

Meanwhile, Scottish locations dominate the ten safest areas for car theft with Kirkwall, Perth, Paisley and Galashiels all taking top positions.

Other areas with the lowest theft rate include the Isle of Man with a rate of 0.39 claims per 1,000 and Llandrindod Wells with a rate of 0.79.

South West towns Plymouth and Exeter also made the list.

When it comes to age, the research found drivers aged 30 to 39 are the most likely to report their car as stolen with a theft rate of 8.78 per 1,000 people whilst those aged 20 to 24 years face the least risk at a rate of 4.09.

This compares to 2020, where 40 to 49 year olds were most likely to face higher risk of car theft with a rate of 8.33.

The Ford Fiesta was the vehicle most targeted by thieves in 2020 with 3,392 reported cases, according to DVLA statistics, followed by the Land Rover Range Rover with 2,881 cases then the Volkswagen Golf at 1,975 cases.

Praksha Patel-Shah, car insurance expert at Money Super Market, said: 'Not only can where you live and park your car increase the likelihood of you experiencing car theft, but criminals are now becoming more inventive and sophisticated when it comes to modern vehicles, so extra preventions may be necessary.

'Our research shows that urban, built-up areas have the highest incidences of car theft, while more rural, remote areas tend to record fewer instances.

'Insurers do consider your location when providing you with a quote, so if you live in an area with a high theft rate, you might see this reflected in higher premiums.

'Regardless of your location, shopping around for a new car insurance policy can help reduce your costs significantly – in just a matter of minutes you could save up to £236 a year.'

Previous research conducted last month found that nine of the top ten locations for car theft are in the capital including the exclusive borough of Kensington and Chelsea as well as Ealing and Wandsworth, according to data collated by Co-Op Insurance.

It found that Preston was the only postcode in the north with car crime stats high enough to be placed within the top 20, sitting at number 13 in the list.

Meanwhile, correlating with the research conducted by Money Super Market, Moray in Scotland was found to have the least frequency of vehicle theft claims in four years.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Buying a piece of land and then designing and building your own home is a pipe dream for many.

But what if you want to turn it into reality? Where do you begin and what are the key things to consider?

We’re not talking about money here and your budget, but rather focusing instead on the process of finding a suitable site and planning permission.

We speak to James Firth, of estate agents Strutt & Parker, for his views on choosing a site and the best chances of securing planning consent.

The biggest mistake is rushing into a project without considering all the steps in the planning process, according to James Firth, of estate agents Strutt & Parker

1: Choosing the site

There are some areas that are better than others to consider if you're planning to build your own home.

Mr Firth explains, for example, that brownfield sites or land that is adjacent to existing development has a better chance of getting planning permission to build on.

'If you do not own the site, development sites can be taken forward on a subject-to-planning basis whereby completion only occurs once planning permission has been obtained,' he said.

2: Check the local plan and development zoning

It is important to check whether the desired land is suitable for building on or is it protected. If it is green belt land, it will have more restrictions.

Mr Firth said: 'The Government's planning reform measures will introduce additional zoning of land, including land for growth, renewal or protection.

'If the land is identified for growth or renewal, it is likely that an existing development will be there already, and will make it easier to move forward with a planning application.

If the land is zoned for protection, it will be more difficult. However, the Government Planning Reform hasn't yet come into play, and there is no fixed date for its roll out, but it is something to bear in mind.'

He added that the Government is also encouraging self-builds and requires local authorities to identify how the need for self-build properties will be met in their area.

3: Draw up plans and engage early with local planning officers

Engaging with the neighbours and local community will help reduce the risks of your planning project.

'This is the point at which you should engage with a planning expert.

'If you're looking to purchase land upon which to build, do some pre-application work to get some feedback from the local authority,' Mr Firth explained.

4: Consider the sustainability

National Planning Policy has recently been amended to give additional emphasis to climate change and sustainability considerations, Mr Firth points out.

'So considering how these can be incorporated into your build will carry significant weight in the planning process,' he said.

Minor scale applications could be decided by the council and the planning authority within eight weeks

5: Consider biodiversity

In a similar vein, Mr Firth explained that proposals are required to minimise impacts on and provide net gains for biodiversity.

'The Environment Act will also be bringing forward additional requirements,' he said.

'Consider the type of property you're building and whether you can incorporate some favourable sustainable features, such as planting trees or wildlife improvement to help secure planning.

6: Getting planning permission

Smaller scale projects are likely to be decided by a planning officer as a delegated decision, whereas some more controversial or larger scale proposals will go through to a planning committee for the council to vote on, according to Mr Firth.

He said: 'There is the option of an appeal to the planning inspectorate if it doesn't go in your favour.

'But above all, it's about focusing on the overall benefits of the proposal - from the design or environmental credentials - these are all taken into account in what's called 'the planning balance'.

'Minor scale applications could be decided by the council and the planning authority within eight weeks.

'However, it can take longer than this. If the time line is exceeded, there's something called a non-determination appeal to the planning inspectorate but this process can take considerably more time.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fund manager Jonathan Brown believes the second half of this year should prove fruitful for investors in UK smaller companies.

The manager of stock market-listed investment trust Invesco Perpetual UK Smaller Companies says a strong recovery in the UK economy should drive equity prices higher in the months ahead.

But he warns that longer term, any rise in interest rates or a significant uptick in inflation could dampen the optimism.

The £211million fund invests in companies that comprise the bottom ten per cent of the UK stock market by size. These are businesses with market capitalisations of £1.5billion or below – although if a holding proves a successful investment, it will continue to be held irrespective of its size.

The trust has no unquoted stakes and steers clear of companies with market capitalisations below £100million. It does this, says Brown, for liquidity reasons. 'We like to be able to sell a stock if we change our mind about it,' he adds. 'You can't do that with an unquoted company or one that is too small.'

It also has no borrowings, unlike other investment trusts which use the loans to increase their exposure to stock markets. 'UK smaller companies is a volatile asset class,' says Brown. 'Borrowing just adds to that volatility.'

Currently, the fund has some 80 holdings, which is on the high side. Brown says this is due to an abundance of investment opportunities and a desire to run a well-diversified portfolio.

'There's a lot out there that excites us,' he says, 'and we want a slice of it. But equally, we don't want huge positions in any one stock.'

Since the pandemic struck, Brown and his deputy Robin West have changed the emphasis of the portfolio away from technology-related stocks to companies involved in leisure – primarily because many leisure stocks had been oversold and stood at irresistible 'silly valuations'.

Companies that have been brought into the portfolio – or where positions have been added to – include Gym Group and Hollywood Bowl Group.

'Gym Group is benefiting from many people wanting to get fit after lockdown,' says Brown. 'As shops close on the high street, it's also been able to find lots of quality space to open new gyms.

'Similarly, Hollywood Bowl is finding plenty of premises to open new bowling alleys.' Last month, the company confirmed it had agreed terms on a new ten-pin bowling centre at Resort World in Birmingham – as well as a golfing venue (under the brand Puttstars) in Harrow, North West London.

Among the trust's biggest holdings are media company Future that has benefited from an increase in demand for digital content – and language translation specialist RWS. Both companies have proved successful investments and the managers have banked some of the profits.

The trust's performance numbers are satisfactory. Over the past year, it has generated an overall return of 57 per cent. This compares to a 19 per cent return from the FTSE All-Share Index over the same period. Longer term, the trust has also significantly outperformed the index.

One attractive feature is its income bent. It pays dividends quarterly and aims to pay an annual income equivalent to four per cent a year.

This was not possible last year because of the impact of the pandemic on UK company dividends, but it is very much an intention this year. The fund's annual charges total 0.91 per cent and the stock market identification code is B1FL3C7.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ministers have been ordered by Britain's statistics watchdog to reveal the data that justifies any decisions to move countries to amber or red status for foreign travel.

Holiday bosses were enraged last month when France was moved to 'amber plus' status – meaning fully-vaccinated travellers still have to quarantine on return to the UK.

There are now fears that Ministers will put European hotspots on a new 'amber watch list', meaning they could go straight on the red list. Families would then face compulsory hotel quarantine on their return at £1,750 per person.

Confusion: Holiday bosses were enraged last month when France was moved to 'amber plus' status

Mary Gregory, at the Office for Statistics Regulation, said the Government 'did not make clear' which data informed decision about France's status.

In a letter to the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC), which advises the Government on Covid measures, Gregory said there was also confusion about how data on cases of the South African Beta variant in France were analysed. Gregory wrote: 'The lack of clear signposting to data sources... falls short of our expectations on transparency. In future we would like to see key information clearly signposted and published more promptly.'

Manchester Airports Group, supported by major airlines including Ryanair, EasyJet and British Airways owner IAG, sued the Government in June over a lack of transparency around its decisions to grade countries red, green or amber.

The High Court ruled in the Government's favour. The airport plans to appeal. Chief executive Charlie Cornish said: 'The confusion around France's amber-plus status is yet another example of the problems caused by the Government's refusal to be open and transparent about traffic light decisions.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There are bullish comments from investment bank Peel Hunt on Mike Ashley's Frasers, which last week confirmed rumours it had begun plans to replace the big man at the helm with his son-in-law.

Analyst Jonathan Pritchard described a presentation on Thursday as 'the most enlightening we have ever seen' from the group, with clear plans for growth.

That includes a strategy for 'exponential' growth in sales of luxury goods, spearheaded by Flannels, while focusing on the sports participation at Sports Direct and potentially diverging from fierce rivalry with JD.

End of an era: Mike Ashley's son-in-law will replace him at the helm of Frasers

But he warned investors will need to hunker down while rising star Mike Murray gets his teeth more firmly into the group strategy and that changes would not come cheaply.

Could 'Little' Mike come with a knack for elevating communication as well as the group's sometimes confusing strategy?

Peel Hunt raised its price target to £5.50 from £4 – still below today's £5.87.

Bumper year for Hargreaves Lansdown

It's likely to be a bumper year for investment supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown, judging by the swathes of 'armchair investors' who have piled into the stock market during the pandemic.

The FTSE100 member will publish its full-year results tomorrow, and analysts at Barclays are expecting a 'record year of activity'.

They reckon annual profits before tax will have risen by more than a tenth to £378.6million.

The results will be a boost to the fund supermarket, which came under fire last year over its loyalty to disgraced investor Neil Woodford.

The site continued to promote Woodford's collapsing Equity Income fund even after it started to run into trouble.

Compass moving in right direction

Catering giant Compass appears to have something cooking, says Shore Capital, following an impressive update last month.

Momentum in new contract wins 'stands out' with a 'blue sky' scenario that revenues could hit £35billion by the middle of the decade.

Shore suggests the firm is recovering faster than the market is giving it credit for and that upgrades could be down the line.

Buy with a fair value of £16, it says.

Credit Suisse revises share target at Robert Walters

Credit Suisse says 'strong activity' in permanent recruitment at consultancy Robert Walters has prompted it to revise its share price target from £7.75 to £8.15.

Robert Walters reported record first-half profits last month.

The employment market is encouraging on several fronts, from rising starting salaries, shortages in some industries and demand from companies reopening after extended periods of lockdown.

Credit Suisse is more muted on the medium-term prospects, but with the market hotting up in the short term, its price forecast would be a premium on Robert Walters' £6.74 close on Friday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An American aerospace company has launched an audacious attempt to gatecrash the £6.3billion takeover of British group Meggitt.

Transdigm has proposed buying the FTSE 250 defence contractor for 900p per share.

This values Meggitt at a whopping £7billion and far outweighs an 800p bid from another American company, – Parker Hannifin – that Meggitt's board agreed to last week.

Target acquired: US aerospace firm Transdigm has proposed buying Meggitt for 900p per share which values the FTSE 250 defence contractor at a whopping £7bn

Meggitt's shares rose 16.1 per cent, or 115p, to 830p last night, indicating that shareholders believe Transdigm could successfully hijack the deal.

Transdigm has not yet put in a formal offer, so Meggitt's board are still backing Parker. But even if it wins the company's support, Transdigm could still face an uphill battle to convince ministers a sale would not put Britain's national security at risk.

Parker's approach triggered outcry among MPs and military figures, such as former head of the Royal Navy Admiral Lord West, who said there was a 'real risk' it could compromise security. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was already monitoring Meggitt's talks with Parker.

The issue has been compounded by a takeover frenzy that has seen private equity firms and foreign companies swoop on British companies.

This includes another FTSE 250 firm, Ultra Electronics, whose sale has also raised alarm.

Coventry-based Meggitt traces its origins back to the 1850s and now has a 9,000 staff, including more than 2,000 in the UK, and makes parts for planes and military aircraft.

This includes making 'black boxes' for the RAF's Typhoon jets and the wheel and brake systems for American F-35s.

Transdigm, which is worth £25billion, was founded in 1993 and has risen to become a member of New York's S&P 500 index.

It has been a serial dealmaker, buying up around 60 businesses in its first 25 years, and is split into around 46 companies.

These make everything from parachutes to pumps and valves. In January it bought the aerospace and connectivity arm of former FTSE 250 group Cobham for £696million.

Both Parker and Transdigm are based in Cleveland, Ohio, where the Wright Brothers worked on the world's first aeroplanes.

Parker's offer was 70.5 per cent higher than Meggitt's share price before the deal was announced – a huge premium by City standards.

But Transdigm's is a jaw-dropping 92 per cent higher.

Parker has undertaken to keep Meggitt's HQ in the UK and invest in research and development.

The offers, which were also an attempt to assuage ministers' doubts, have been heavily criticised as most are only valid for one year.

Meggitt yesterday said: 'The board… will continue to consider carefully not only the financial terms of any offer but also Transdigm's plans for the company and the potential impact across all its stakeholders.'

These include Meggitt's staff, pension schemes and the Ministry of Defence.

Transdigm faces being treated warily as it has also pitched itself as having a 'private equity-like capital structure and culture'.

It aims to provide big returns and says it can create value, which, for private equity firms, often means it will buy a business but then break it up and sell many or all of the parts to the highest bidder.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Online fashion star Boohoo has announced plans to create 5,000 jobs over the next five years, as it battles back from criticism over poor working conditions at suppliers.

The fast-growing retailer, which recently bought the Debenhams brand, said jobs will come from a £500million growth programme, as it expands its warehouse and builds new IT systems.

Jobs are expected to be created at both its head office in Manchester and warehouse in Burnley.

Boohoo's boss has also said that it will try to improve the environmental impact of fast fashion by making at least 20 per cent of its clothes sustainable by autumn and 40 per cent by next spring.

Boohoo co-founders Mahmud Kamani (left) and Carol Kane (centre) with boss John Lyttle (right). The online fashion retailer will create new jobs over five years

The announcement came as Boohoo published a report on its positive economic impact on the UK.

It claimed that Boohoo added £559.4million to the economy in the past year, meaning the business now accounts for 4.4 per cent of the total UK clothing and footwear retail sector.

The fashion retailer also claimed it supported 8,050 full-time roles and that for every job created by Boohoo and its brands, a further 1.7 were added to the wider economy.

The storm over suppliers and concerns over fast fashion's environmental impact have weighed heavily on Boohoo shares at a time when screening for Environmental, Social and Governance attributes are all the rage in the investment world.

Boohoo shares rose 4.1 per cent, or 10.9p, to 276.8p towards London market close, but remain well below their peak of just over 400p last summer.

Boohoo has been trying to shed its negative image following revelations that some of its suppliers in Leicester had been operating in sweatshop conditions.

Last summer, two of its factories in the UK were accused of poor working conditions and of paying as little as £3.50 to £4 an hour to workers producing its clothes.

The group has cut ties with hundreds of its suppliers since then, and pledged to link multimillion-pound bonuses for its directors with improvements in its supply chain.

But some shareholder groups and investors remain dissatisfied, with over 20 per cent of votes opposing the company's remuneration report at its annual general meeting in June.

Some 12 per cent of votes were also cast against the re-election of co-founder and executive director Carol Kane.

Over the past year, Boohoo has snapped up a series of failed high street names, including Coast, Karen Millen, Dorothy Perkins and Debenhams.

In 2021, they bought two new warehouses, one in Wellingborough and one in Daventry, both of which give the group an additional 1.845million square feet of space and support over 2,000 jobs, it added.

In logistics alone, the group employs 7,000 people at four distribution centres in the UK and ships between 190,000 and 230,000 parcels a day, which are handled by 13 main courier companies and supported an estimated 1,660 jobs in the last financial year, it said.

In the report, it also claimed that it moved over 1,400 agency colleagues from its warehouse teams onto permanent boohoo contracts in the last financial year.

Boohoo has released a positive impact report after coming under fire for claimed poor working practices at its suppliers (Pictured: Emma Claire attends the boohoo Black Friday gifting suite last year)

Sustainability has also become a key talking point in the sector, with shoppers opting to keep items of clothing for longer and move away from so-called 'throwaway fashion'.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live’s Wake Up To Money podcast, chief executive John Lyttle said sustainability will take several years to achieve.

He said: 'We’re trying make the journey as sustainable as possible… 20 per cent of all our ranges will be sustainable this autumn… 40 per cent next spring/summer.'

He added: 'They’re not going to be fixed in six and 12 months… It’s the same 2030 timeframe as combustible engines.'

Sustainability concerns: CEO John Lyttle said sustainability will take several years to achieve

However, there is no mention of this in its latest report 'Agenda for Change' published today.

However, Noelle Hatley, senior lecturer in fashion business at Manchester's Fashion Institute, told the BBC that brands were able to use the term 'sustainable' because there was 'no industry-wide agreement on its meaning'.

'40% is a reasonable target, but it all hinges on what they mean by sustainable and how much information they will actually share with the customers,' she said.

Reborn sixties coachbuilder, Radford, has cemented its return today with the unveiling of its Lotus Type 62-2 sportscar to the public for the first time in America.

The 'Gold Leaf' version is just one of 12 that will be produced in this livery - and one of just 62 examples built in total.

It has debuted in California at the Quail Lodge show, which is part of Monterey Car Week in California.

The resurgent brand - which is being spearheaded by 2009 F1 champion Jenson Button, TV vehicle restorer Ant Anstead and designer Mark Stubbs - says it is now taking build slot applications for this ultra-exclusive model – and over half of the cars have already been allocated to owners.

Radford's return complete: The reborn coachbuilder has for the first time displayed its new Lotus Type 62-2 in the flesh, debuting the ultra-exclusive supercar at the Quail Lodge Show in California

The Gold Leaf Type 62-2 Quail Edition is the first of the bespoke models to be seen in the metal by members of the public.

It has a modern twist on the iconic Lotus Gold Leaf racing livery, which is one of the most famous and significant racing car colourways to grace Formula 1.

Its legendary red, white and gold colour scheme was applied after Colin Chapman signed a huge deal with Gold Leaf, and is most well-known on the Type 49B raced Graham Hill raced during the 1968 season. The colour scheme also featured on the famous Lotus 72 F1 car raced by Emerson Fittipaldi and Jochen Rindt in the 1970 season.

This special edition version stands apart from the other 12 Golf Leaf models due to its bespoke carbon fibre composite front splitter and rear diffuser, AP brake calipers and carbon ceramic brake rotors.

These are housed within larger 18-inch front and 19-inch rear Dymag carbon composite wheels, which are unique to the Quail Lodge example.

With a lower unsprung mass than the standard wheels, they should fractionally improve the nimble handling characteristics of the car, especially when wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres.

Speaking in the US today, its designer, Mark Stubbs, said: 'The Radford Type 62-2 in Gold Leaf guise, is a really special car. From a design perspective, the Gold Leaf car with these bespoke additions really stands out, with larger diffusers, and wheels. And sporting one of the most iconic racing liveries ever to grace a Formula 1 car, gives the car a real presence and sense of occasion.

'We’re only making 12 of these iconic cars, meaning they are already one of the rarest cars that money can buy. And most of them are already allocated to their owners.'

This special edition version stands apart from the other 12 Golf Leaf models due to its bespoke carbon fibre composite front splitter and rear diffuser, AP brake calipers and carbon ceramic brake rotors

Other features include a huge carbon-fibre rear diffuser and gold-tipped exhaust outlets. Radford says it has sold around half of the 62 models being produced

Radford is inspired by the legendary British coachbuilding company of the same name, which once built cars for a celebrity clientele that included all four of The Beatles.

Production of the Radford Type 62-2 begins in late 2021, with first deliveries being made in 2022.

While Radford says half are sold and it is taking applications for orders for the remaining models, it says it will not disclose a price due to the tailored nature of each vehicle for each customers, which ultimately determines how expensive individual cars will be.

The entry version is called the 'Classic' and will feature the Lotus V6 engine with 430bhp and a six-speed manual gearbox

What we already know about Radford's Lotus Type 62-2 road car

The supercar will be powered by a supercharged 3.5-litre V6 engine currently used in the Lotus Exige and will mark the first Radford coachbuilt creation for more than half a century.

An entry-level 'Classic' trim option comes with 430bhp and a six-speed manual gearbox.

It will be sold with forged alloy wheels - 17 inches up front and 18 inches at the rear - and use adjustable coilover suspension, Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres and AP racing brake calipers and iron discs.

There will also be a unique electronic stability programme to modulate power and grip designed by Bosch.

The six-cylinder engine will be upgraded to a more potent 500bhp output with the addition of stronger con-rods, new pistons, more aggressive camshafts, a remapped ECU and a titanium exhaust system.

Customers will get the option of a sharp-shifting seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox.

It also receives upgraded two-piece forged aluminium wheels that are an inch larger in diameter on each axle compared to those fitted to the Classic trim - though are still lighter.

A motorsport-derived traction control and ABS system - honed by Jenson Button - will also feature to control the extra engine performance.

Radford confirmed in July that it had purchased the rights to use the legendary John Player Special - or JPS - black and gold livery

The most powerful Type 62-2 is a 'JPS' version with 600bhp and the same stunning livery used on Emerson Fittipaldi's championship-winning Lotus-Ford 72D, pictured here during practice for the Grand Prix of Great Britain at Brands Hatch on 15 July 1972

Finally, the top grade examples will be the 'JPS' variants.

Having recently purchased the rights to use the legendary John Player Special black and gold livery, Radford will use the stunning scheme used on Emmerson Fittipaldi's 1972 championship-winning Lotus Type 72D F1 car for its most powerful 600bhp Type 62-2 with all the bells and whistles.

The unique thing about this engine is that we've kept it pure, no exhaust valves, no trickery of any kind – what you hear is uncorrupted and utterly authentic Jenson Button

While the top-spec gets the same chassis setup as the Gold Leaf version it has even lighter carbon composite wheels, monobloc calipers and carbon ceramic brake discs.

The team behind the limited-run car promise that the V6 engine will make a decent rumble, too.

'The sound of the Type 62-2 even at idle is something really special. But when you begin to explore the rev range further up, it becomes incredible, raising the hairs on the back of your neck and putting a big smile on your face,' Button says.

'However, the unique thing about this engine is that we've kept it pure, no exhaust valves, no trickery of any kind – what you hear is uncorrupted and utterly authentic – just like every single element of the driving experience.'

Underpinning each model will be a Lotus platform, with a modified version of the bonded aluminium chassis from the Elise and Exige sports cars.

Only 62 examples of the Type 62-2 will be created, with production due to start at the end of this year and first deliveries arriving in early 2022

The bodywork will be almost entirely carbon composite while the cabin will also be wrapped in a carbon fibre roll-over crash to provide occupant protection in the event of an accident

The bodywork will be almost entirely carbon composite while the cabin will also be wrapped in a carbon fibre roll-over crash to provide occupant protection in the event of an accident.

The combination of lightweight materials means the Type 62-2 should tip the scales at around 1,000kg - which is about the same as a Volkswagen Up! city car.

That means, in the most extreme JPS guise, the 600bhp-per-tonne ratio will be better than the V8 Mclaren 675 LT (564bhp per tonne), V12 Pagani Huayra Roadster (589bhp per tonne) and even the quad-turbo W16 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse (595bhp-per-tonne).

To improve both stiffness and how well it stick to the road in the bends, Radford will fit a bespoke - and sophisticated - tubular rear subframe that is promised to be a welded piece of art that's visible from the back of the car.

Like you'd find on most race cars, the underside of the new Type 62-2 is completely flat.

This is designed to channel air towards the rear diffuser to generate downforce at high speeds.

As a result, the Classic version does without a spoiler at all, while the Gold Leaf and JPS will have just a pair of small ducktails at each rear quarter. However, the JPS example will have a larger rear diffuser and front splitter to generate more load into the tarmac.

The Gold Leaf and JPS versions will both feature small ducktail tips on the rear quarters, which mimic those featured on the original Lotus car

Radford is best known for coachbuilt cars, especially bespoke Minis in the 1960s. Left: Britt Ekland received a one-off Radford Mini from her husband Peter Sellers for her birthday in 1965. Right: John Lennon pictured in his bespoke Radford Mini. One was built for each member of the band

Commenting on the project, Jenson Button explained: 'Creating a car that is simultaneously luxurious and comfortable, and great to drive, is a tough challenge, but the first Radford of the modern era delivers.

'Type 62-2 is a driver's car at its heart – when you see the design, it looks just like a 70s Le Mans car. And when you sit behind the steering wheel and look through the curved windscreen, you can see the front wheel arches – something you just don't experience on road cars today.

'With such a low centre of gravity, the car's body doesn't roll. The chassis exhibits all the hallmarks of a beautifully set up race car for the road – gifting the driver supreme confidence to extract maximum enjoyment every journey.'

Radford's design will remain true to the original Lotus's compact dimensions and will stand just 1,133mm tall - that's only fractionally higher than an original Ford GT40 and makes the Type 62-2 one of the shortest models on the market.

Stood alongside the car on which it's based, you might struggle to tell them apart at first glance - that includes the like-for-like doors, which will cut into the roof panel like a sixties endurance racer.

While this is a great period feature, it could cause problematic for taller drivers to get in and out. Jeremy Clarkson famously bought a modern-era GT40 in 2005 and struggled not only to get in but also to close the doors due to the lack of headroom.

Clarkson sold the car at the RM Sotheby's Monterey sale in 2017 for $379,500, having covered just 60 miles in the supercar.

The wing mirrors look like those on the original car but feature cameras mounted inside their housings that relay live images to the driver via small screens on each A-pillar so they can see what's going on around them

The Type 62-2 will stand just 1,133mm tall, making it one of the lowest cars to enter the market in recent history. The two doors will also have sections that cut into the roof panel, just like a sixties endurance racer

Jenson Button is not only one of the owners of the revitalised Radford brand but also in charge of making sure the bespoke supercars offer the best driving experience

Modern upgrades include LED headlights - which have been designed to look like the original lamps - and a connecting LED bar between the two brake light clusters.

It also gets wing mirrors that are similar in shape to those on the original car but feature cameras mounted inside their housings that relay live images to the driver via small screens on each A-pillar so they can see what's going on around them.

Inside, Radford promises creature comforts including a five-speaker stereo, digital rear-view camera and six-inch digital instrument cluster.

For those customers intending to take their Lotus remake back to the track, there's a built in data logger and configurable displays the simplify the digital instrument cluster to show speed, gear selection and lap times for when they're hurtling around a circuit.

Each version will also be sold with an optional power nose lift system, which raised the front of the car so it can clear speed bumps and difficult angles for car parks and sloped driveways.

Customers will also get the opportunity to increase the bespoke purchase price with the addition of matching custom luggage from Mason and Sons, which slots under the front clamshell.

The returning car brand says buyers will work closely with its design team to select every element of their bespoke vehicle, from the upholstery finishes, paint colours and aero features on the bodywork.

It's for this reason it says it can't make the price of the cars publicly known.

Stubbs said: 'Coachbuilding in the modern era utterly liberates an automotive designer. Advances in technology have ushered in a new era of this historic craft, making it possible to achieve levels of quality and design never before possible and deliver them in an extremely short time.

'This enables us to evoke the spirit of an iconic car with stunning authenticity and offer owners the ultimate in customisation. However, while Type 62-2 elicits the original Type 62 Lotus hallmarks, it sets its own path as a Radford model – it's all about creating a feeling of driving something timeless. Something that doesn't look or feel like anything else on the road.'

Production of the Radford Type 62-2 begins in late 2021, with first deliveries being made in the first quarter of 2022.

Anstead added: 'Only 62 Radford Type 62 models will ever be built. No two will be exactly alike, and each will be an exceptionally rare sight on the world's roads.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Will Informa be the first FTSE100-listed company of the year to be targeted by a private equity giant? Or is an industry rival preparing a swoop on the publishing and events company?

Those are the questions investors are asking themselves as rumours whip around the Square Mile about a possible takeover of Informa, the publisher of titles including Lloyd's List.

In 2008, several private equity firms including Providence and Carlyle came together to attempt a buyout of Informa, but the deal collapsed amid the fallout from the financial crisis.

Uncertain future: Will Informa be the first FTSE100-listed company of the year to be targeted by a private equity giant?

Since then, Informa has grown substantially. It merged with rival UBM in 2018 to create Britain's biggest events and publishing firm.

However, just last year Informa was forced to go cap in hand to shareholders via a £1billion rights issue amid fears for its financial prospects.

Now, however, the talk in the market is that a mystery predator is working with banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup on a blockbuster £10 billion-plus takeover bid.

Mast Energy secures backing from major player?

Among the small caps, Mast Energy Developments – a tiny reserve power plant specialist – has come into focus amid talk it has secured financial backing from a major industry player.

Word is a 'strategic business' is prepared to lend Mast around £10 million to help the company fund its growth.

Mast said recently it had bought a gas-powered generation plant in Derbyshire called Pyebridge Power for £2.5million.

That will take it nine megawatts closer to the 300 megawatts it hopes one day to be generating.

Buzz around Yourgene Health

There is a bit of a buzz around Yourgene Health, a molecular diagnostics company.

Last week the business, which is chaired by serial small investor Adam Reynolds, unveiled final results showing first quarter revenue had risen by 80 per cent to £6million.

And City gossips claim Yourgene Health could soon see further substantial revenue growth as the company is set to win further major contracts.

Market practitioners expect a series of broker upgrades if those new contracts come good.

Rare earth minerals firm Pensana set for loans

With the environment at the top of the political agenda it may not be a surprise to hear that the Government could be about to give the green light to a set of multi-million pound loans to Pensana, a London-listed rare earth minerals firm.

In March, the company said it would receive money from the Government's £1billion Automotive Transformation Fund. City sources said more detail is about to emerge about the loan.

Earlier this year it emerged that Pensana was looking to develop Western Europe's first rare earth processing plant, a £90 million separation facility in Hull.

The aim is to produce a sustainable supply of rare earth oxides, used in offshore wind turbines and electric vehicles.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What happens when you're stuck in a five-mile tailback in an electric car with less than a full battery charge?

It's a question consumer watchdog Which? has attempted to answer after it had received messages from its members concerned an EV's battery will be sapped if a driver is using the air-con, heated seats and other features in a traffic jam.

It found that over an hour at a standstill with the lights on, modulating the cabin temperature, streaming music and playing videos through screens in the back had only a small impact on energy usage - losing just 2 per cent capacity, or eight miles of range.

However, it warned the test was conducted in the summer and suggested the capacity could deplete quicker in colder conditions and batteries don't perform at their optimum level.

EV myth busting! Will an electric vehicle's battery drain when stuck in traffic and you want to use features such as air-con and heated-seats? A consumer watchdog has simulated being stuck in a tailback in a plug-in model to find out

'Electric cars are still relatively new and there is a lot of misinformation out there about battery range, including dystopian style warnings of dormant electric cars strewn across our roads because the air-con (or lights, or similar) drained the battery in a traffic jam,' Which? explained.

To attempt to disprove the myth, it simulated a traffic jam scenario in the latest Volkswagen ID.4 electric SUV.

To understand how battery capacity was impacted by the vehicle being stationary, the test was conducted with music being streamed through the Android Auto system built into the infotainment system.

Both front heated seats were also turned up to the highest temperature setting, the air-con at full blast, dipped headlights on (not on automatic, but manually on) and a tablet plugged into a USB socket playing a film in the back seats.

After just over an hour and 15 minutes the VW's battery lost just 2 per cent of of its 77kWh capacity - the equivalent of only eight miles in range.

We’ll return to this subject in winter, when the temperature starts dropping, to look at what happens Which? UK research team

'In short, a very small amount of the electric car’s battery was used to keep the car comfortable,' the study revealed.

However, Which? did point out that its controlled test was conducted on a summer’s day and warned that cold weather will have more of an affect on the car’s power usage.

'We’ll return to this subject in winter, when the temperature starts dropping, to look at what happens,' it promised.

While Which? said the mini test had proved a point, it warned that in colder conditions the impact on the batteries is likely to be bigger

Commenting on the test results, Lisa Barber, Which?'s products and services Editor, said: 'There is a lot of misinformation out there about electric vehicles, including whether you are likely to run out of juice when stuck in a traffic jam.

'However, our research has shown that electric vehicles can preserve their battery power well, even if they are stuck in traffic with the music, air-con and headlights on.

'We know consumers are open to switching to electric vehicles, however there are several barriers to ownership that must be addressed including perceived performance, the high upfront cost of a new electric vehicle and the UK's fragmented public charging network, which needs to be overhauled to ensure it is fit-for-purpose.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A British miner has teamed up with a company backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos to hunt down a mega-deposit of metals used in electric cars.

London-listed Bluejay Mining is set to receive £11m of funding over three years to explore an area of southern Greenland – which is undergoing a rush for metals used in the green transport revolution.

The cash will help fund work on a huge potential mine as part of the Disko-Nuussuaq project. The mine, which Bluejay bought licences for in 2017, is thought to contain nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum-group metals.

The right stuff: Greenland's stable government and vast amounts of geological data have made it a good bet for KoBold, which seeks ethical sources for metals

The investment will come from KoBold Metals, which is funded by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, an investment fund backed by billionaires Gates, Bezos, and Michael Bloomberg.

Companies are racing to find new sources of cobalt – which is often mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is linked to human rights abuses.

Greenland's stable government and vast amounts of geological data have made it a good bet for KoBold, which seeks ethical sources for metals. It will be the first time KoBold, which uses artificial intelligence to scour for sites, has teamed up with a company listed on a junior market.

Bluejay is worth £91m – a tiny player compared with other companies with licences in Greenland such as Anglo American. Bluejay's executive chairman Rod McIllree said: 'The key thing KoBold see with us is that, while they bring technical and financial capacity, we bring the project itself.

'Also, because we've been operating in Greenland for so long, we have very good relations.' He added that Greenland was key to American investors, who are trying to fend off Chinese interest.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I am a flat owner looking to buy the freehold - what is the section 5 notice I've been issued with and how does it work? VP

Have you been served a section 5 notice? A section 5 notice is the landlord’s offer to sell the freehold

Myra Butterworth, MailOnline's Property expert replies: A section 5 notice is the landlord’s offer to sell the freehold.

The right to buy the freehold can be extremely valuable for leaseholders.

Leaseholders who buy the freehold can give themselves 999 year leases - removing clauses such as uncapped ground rent increases and high permission charges for things like keeping pets.

Liam Spender, of law firm Velitor Law, replies: The Section 5 is a Right of First Refusal that requires the freeholder to offer the freehold to leaseholders at the same price he could potentially offer to a third party.

Qualifying tenants - who are typically leaseholders but the term includes others - have the right of first refusal to buy their freehold.

That is if they live in the right type of building and if the freeholder wants to sell the freehold. The right is set out in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987.

The law also covers other types of transactions. It is a criminal offence for a freeholder to sell the freehold to a third party without first offering to sell it to the leaseholders at the same price. A sale in breach of the 1987 Act may also see the purchaser forced to sell the freehold to the leaseholders.

The right is extremely valuable. Leaseholders who buy the freehold can give themselves 999 year leases at no ground rent and without high permission fees for things like keeping pets.

They can also take over the management of the property. That means no longer having to rely on a third party landlord and having much greater control over their buildings. Unfortunately, the law is often legitimately avoided in relation to new build flats.

Two examples are developers agreeing forward sales while the building is still under construction, or developers including more than 50 per cent non-residential floor space in the building.

Leaseholders who buy the freehold can give themselves 999 year leases at no ground rent and without high permission fees for things like keeping pets

EVALUATING A FREEHOLD OFFER Adrian Lowery of Thisismoney says: I know from personal experience that buying a freehold can be a tricky and sometimes confusing experience. However, receiving a section 5 at least clears the first hurdle, in that it shows the freeholder is willing to sell! Whether of course the price is agreeable to the leaseholders or not is a different matter, and that will in part determine how you respond to the notice. It may be that the third party is willing to pay a price that you are not. You can get an estimate of the value of a freehold by using calculators that can be found online. For a valuation with more weight (which will almost certainly be necessary in any negotiations with a freeholder) you will need a chartered surveyor. It is also worth bearing in mind that where there are just two leaseholders (as in, say a house that has been converted into flats), setting up a company to buy the freehold might not be necessary: the process can often be managed with a Declaration of Trust, which is less hassle. An excellent – and free – resource for all leaseholders confronting various issues is the Leasehold Advisory Service. Advertisement

A section 5 notice is the landlord’s offer to sell the freehold. The landlord must serve the notice on 90 per cent of all leaseholders. If someone proves that the notice is not served on 90 per cent of all qualifying tenants, the landlord may still potentially be prosecuted.

The 1987 Act does not define what service means. The Interpretation Act 1978 says that a notice served by post is deemed served in the ordinary course of post. This is the second working day after posting a first class letter and the fourth working day after posting a second class letter.

Lease terms also often include notice clauses that say when a notice from the landlord is deemed served, typically two to three days after posting, which may assist where the landlord is the freeholder.

Once leaseholders are deemed served with the section 5 notice, they have to decide whether to accept the landlord’s offer. They have two months to decide.

While the price is mentioned in the Section 5 notice, that is the price at which the freeholder is looking to sell to a third party.

But the freeholder cannot sell the freehold to someone else until after the end of the two month period. More than 50 per cent of all leaseholders must accept the offer. If there are 10 leaseholders then at least six must agree.

The freeholder’s offer must be accepted within two months of service of the section 5 notice. Once more than 50 per cent of the total number of leaseholders agree there is no need to wait for further leaseholders to join.

The accepting leaseholders must accept by sending a section 6 notice containing all of the information set out in the 1987 Act.

The accepting leaseholders must also nominate a purchaser to buy the freehold. This can be done at the same time as sending the section 6 notice. It must also be done within two months of service of the section 5 notice.

Usually the nominated purchaser is a company in which all accepting leaseholders take a share. The accepting leaseholders provide money to the company to buy the freehold. All of the money must be in place by the time of exchange of contracts for the purchase.

Once the leaseholders have nominated a purchaser and sent their section 6 notice the freeholder cannot sell to anyone else, unless the nominated purchaser withdraws. The freeholder still has the right to decide not to proceed with the sale of the freehold at any point up to exchange of contracts.

The process can take months and disputes in this area can be lengthy and costly to resolve.

This area of law is highly complicated. Specialist advice is a must. It is advisable to have a specialist lawyer and chartered surveyor in place. This article is not a substitute for specific legal advice.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A global fund invested in shares around the world makes a good core element for your portfolio.

A tracker or index fund will follow the global index, while an active fund will try to cherry pick the best companies, which could increase your returns but also the chance the manager could get it wrong, or their style will fall out of favour.

These are ideas, not recommendations - always do your own research:

Passive funds

Fidelity Index World Fund P

This follows the companies that make up the MSCI World Index of developed markets. Ongoing charges: 0.13%

HSBC FTSE All World Index Fund C

This follows a global index that also includes an emerging markets element. Ongoing charges: 0.16%

iShares MSCI ACWI ETF

This is an ETF that follows an index made up of both developed and emerging markets companies.Ongoing charges: 0.6%

Active funds

These are four of the most popular global funds and investment trusts

Lindsell Train Global Equity

This fund buys and holds what the well-respected managers Michael Lindsell and Nick Train see as the world’s best companies.

Nick Train has been dubbed Britain's answer to Warren Buffett due to his buy and hold quality and value strategy. This global equity fund run with his business partner has paid off handsomely, with its relatively small portfolio making it third best sector performer over five years. Ongoing charges: 0.74%

Fundsmith Equity

Terry Smith’s fund invests in global companies he perceives as having an enduring advantage. This means that it heavily backs consumer brands and well-known names. These companies are picked due to their high return on and considered as those with the power to turn cash into consistent profit.

Performance has been good but it is heavily weighted to the US, read more on Fundsmith here. Ongoing charges: 0.97%

Witan investment trust

This investment trust targets long-term growth and invests with a variety of fund managers around the world, however, a third of it is in UK shares.

Witan is offered recommended as a solid cornerstone investment in a portfolio and due to its multi-manager approach it spreads its risk widely, with no single company making up more than 2% of the trust's holdings. Ongoing charges: 0.86%

Scottish Mortgage

This is the third best-performing global investment trust over ten years and Scottish Mortgage regularly features on best buy lists. It is a big trust that's cheap to own and which targets what the managers see as the world's most exciting companies.

That means big bets on firms they think could change the world, such as Tesla, Amazon and Baidu, and also investments in companies not listed on the stock market. Its investment strategy has paid off but means it is riskier than other options. Ongoing charges: 0.44%

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When lockdown arrived in March it sunk the UK economy.

The message was clear: Stay home.

And people did just that; there was a dramatic shift to either working from home or shutting down businesses entirely.

For a couple of weeks pretty much the only place you could go was the supermarket, followed a little while later by the opportunity to head to B&Q to queue for an hour and try to do a click and collect.

Now a second lockdown has arrived for England and the message is once again stay home, but things are very different this time: considerably more remains open.

As England’s lockdown arrived, Wales and Northern Ireland were already in some form of lockdown and Scotland is running its own tight tiers system.

Yet, while rules vary across the nations, more businesses remain open, Britain has got used to working from home, and industries that can’t do that are permitted to keep going.

So, what happens now to the economy? How bad will the hit be? And is it just the hospitality sector and leisure sector that will be hammered this time round?

GDP took a nosedive as lockdown arrived and the UK economy was one of the worst hit in the world by coronavirus. Growth has picked up sharply since then, but the BoE now predicts a 2% contraction in the final three months of 2020

Everyone, however, will need money to live so the pressure is on to start saving for later life as early as possible.

Many astute savers use independent financial advisers to help them make the right choices.

Growth: Tatton Asset Management works exclusively for independent financial advisers

And these advisers are increasingly turning to investment platforms – online services that allow users to buy, sell and hold shares and funds.

Individual savers use the likes of Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell, but others are specifically targeted towards advisers.

According to recent figures, advisers hold around £650billion of their customers' money on platforms and the figure is expected to grow to £1trillion by 2025.

Tatton Asset Management is neatly placed to benefit from this trend. The group works exclusively for independent financial advisers, helping them to create investment portfolios that suit their customers' needs and sit on digital platforms.

The company is growing fast, chief executive Paul Hogarth is highly ambitious and the shares, at £4.95, should go far.

Hogarth has spent more than three decades in financial services, mostly focused on supporting financial advisers. Having founded his first business, Bankhall, in the 1980s he built it up, sold it on and founded another company,

Paradigm, just before the financial crisis. Paradigm helps advisers to ensure they are compliant with all the latest regulations.

The firm quickly developed a name for top service and over the years, advisers began asking Hogarth if he could do more to help them.

In 2013, he responded by setting up Tatton Asset Management, folding Paradigm into the business but adding a new layer – a range of different investment portfolios that advisers can offer to their customers.

Today, Tatton works with more 650 financial advisers who between them have some 70,000 end-customers.

By 2030, Government statisticians think there will be 16million people over the age of 65

These savers can choose from around 45 different portfolios, catering for almost every kind of investment need from ultra-cautious to super-adventurous, with a number of green options thrown in for good measure.

Known as model or managed portfolio services, these investment collections provide elements of bespoke management but at a cut-price rate.

Headquartered in Wilmslow, Cheshire, Tatton was the cheapest on the market back in 2013 and remains highly competitive to this day. Importantly too, the group delivers robust, above-average investment returns and decent service.

The combination has helped Hogarth expand the company consistently over the years, offering rising dividends to shareholders along the way.

Looking ahead, Hogarth intends to go even further, taking assets under management to £15billion over the next three years, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.

Several deals are in the pipeline and, such is Tatton's reputation that most followers believe the group will easily reach its £15billion target and almost certainly exceed it in the coming years.

The more advisers that Tatton works with and the more of their clients' money that it looks after, the more profitable it should become.

Brokers predict revenues will increase 10 per cent to £25.7million in the year to March 2022, with profits growing from £11.2million to £12.3million. The following year, a 15 per cent increase in profits is forecast, to £14.2million.

Hogarth is the biggest shareholder in Tatton, with an 18 per cent stake in the company. Not only is he motivated to succeed but he also recognises the importance of dividends.

Payments increased almost 15 per cent to 11p in the year to March 2021, even as multiple companies cut or reduced their dividends. Further increases are pencilled in for this year and beyond.

Midas verdict: Tatton is a well-run business in a growing market. The group has made strong progress in recent years, the pace of growth is accelerating and Hogarth's own stake provides reassurance. At £4.95, the shares are a buy.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investment trust Capital Gearing is a fund for all seasons. It's not sexy, or exciting, but it will do all it can to preserve the real value of investors' long-term wealth.

Given its broad exposure to all major asset classes, and its long-term track record, many investors use it as their one and only investment holding.

The trust was launched 39 years ago and now has assets valued at £690million.

Many investors are using Capital Gearing Trust as their one and only investment holding

Peter Spiller, a sprightly and enthusiastic 72, has overseen the portfolio from day one – although today, the fund is run by a four-strong team which makes up Capital Gearing Asset Management, the investment management company that looks after assets totalling £3.4billion.

'It's unique,' says Spiller of the investment trust.

'Only once has the trust's share price fallen over the course of a calendar year – 2013 – and every year we strive to reduce the fund's costs.

'Fees are important because investment returns generally will not be great going forward.' The fund's annual charges currently total a modest 0.58 per cent.

Spiller is concerned that equity markets are heading for a 'considerable' correction, although he's unsure when this will happen.

'All the indicators suggest markets are overvalued,' he says. 'They could fall a long way.'

Spiller currently equates equity markets to milk in a pan. 'There's a lot of heat under the pan,' he says, 'and the froth is rising as evidenced by the soaring price of Bitcoin and the growth in special purpose acquisition companies looking for investment opportunities.

'What we don't know is how high the side of the pan is and at what stage the milk spills over.'

It's not surprising, therefore, that Capital Gearing has less than half of its assets exposed to equities and investment funds.

Also, most of these holdings are in stock market listed 'specialist' property companies – the likes of real estate trust Secure Income and German housing specialist Vonovia.

The rest of the portfolio is invested in short-term bonds (the fund's 'dry powder') and US index-linked government bonds – commonly known as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (Tips).

Spiller says Tips often come into their own 'when other assets come under pressure'.

The trust's performance numbers confirm its 'Steady Eddie' nature. Over the past five one-year discrete investment periods, it has delivered positive returns of 13.3 per cent (year to May 7, 2021), 3.5 per cent, 6.3 per cent, 3.4 per cent and 12.5 per cent (year to May 7, 2017).

In the past year, it generated a lot of its gains from buying investment trusts whose shares had fallen sharply in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Spiller says: 'We bought trusts where the shares stood at a big discount to the value of their underlying assets, then took our profits as the discounts narrowed as stock markets bounced back.'

Profits were made from the likes of River & Mercantile UK Micro Cap, Diverse Income and Mobius – holdings that have now been disposed of.

Of the 48 per cent of assets in equities and funds, 8 per cent are UK invested – primarily through funds replicating the performance of the FTSE 100 and FTSE250 indexes.

Capital Gearing Asset Management is underpinned by three principles: clients (investors) always come first, never be greedy, and have fun – not in a party way, but in terms of coming into work on a Monday morning with a smile on your face.

The trust's income is minimal – less than one per cent per annum – and is paid out once a year. The stock market identification code is: 0173861.

Oliver and Alexander Kent-Braham, 29, co-founded Marshmallow four years ago when they saw expats hit with extortionate insurance quotes.

Their combined wealth will top £450million as investors pile into the business at a valuation of £869million.

Rising stars: Oliver and Alexander Kent-Braham, 29, co-founded Marshmallow four years ago to help drivers from overseas get cheap insurance

New investment, expected within weeks, will allow it to join the ranks of the UK’s ‘unicorns’, the tech firms valued at more than $1billion.

The firm specialises in covering people turned away by traditional providers and was set up to help drivers from overseas get cheap insurance.

The idea came from a friend who moved to the UK and ‘kept getting hit by these outrageously expensive quotes’.

They promised to update models that punish certain groups of drivers, including immigrants.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Insurance giant Prudential is poised to complete the separation of its US business next month.

Jackson will be spun off following a shareholder vote this month, with investors getting one share in the company for every 40 Pru shares they hold.

The business is then expected to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ‘JXN’.

Prudential is to spin-off its US arm Jackson following a shareholder vote this month, with investors getting one share in the company for every 40 Pru shares they hold

This will leave the Pru focused on Asia and Africa, with headquarters in London. Yesterday, it said it planned to fortify its balance sheet – and its war chest for expansion –by raising up to £2.2billion.

Chief executive Mike Wells said offerings in London and Hong Kong would aim to increase the number of Asian shareholders.

He added: ‘We are continuing to move toward the proposed demerger of Jackson, subject to shareholder approval.

‘The demerger will complete our strategic transformation to focus exclusively on our higher-growth businesses in Asia and Africa.

‘To enhance financial flexibility and de-lever the balance sheet, we continue to consider raising new equity.

'We believe there are clear benefits from increasing our Asian shareholder base and the liquidity of our shares in Hong Kong.’

The Pru posted a paper loss of £3.3billion for the six months to June 30, compared to a £385million profit a year ago.

This was down to complex accounting rules, which say Jackson must be valued differently because it is being spun off, with its ‘fair value’ cut by £5.4billion to £2.2billion.

Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that shareholders had been left no poorer by the accounting change and that the Pru was otherwise ‘thriving’.

It provides life and health insurance, as well as savings products, to 17m people in Asia and Africa, and is listed on the London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore exchanges.

When excluding the Jackson revaluation, it reported a £772million half-year profit, up from £449million the previous year.

That was after new business jumped 29 per cent to £848million.

The Pru's chief exec Mike Wells (pictured), said offerings in London and Hong Kong would aim to increase the number of Asian shareholders

Hyett said: ‘Clearly, Pru’s business model is pedalling along nicely, and we think that bodes well for the long term.

‘The immediate future is less certain, with lockdowns returning across many Asian economies in the face of spiking Delta variant cases, disrupting what is still a very analogue distribution system in many markets – reliant on banks and insurance brokers that can’t open.’

Abid Hussain, analyst at Shore Capital, added: ‘Overall, the equity story and pivot to Asia remains attractive.

Asian insurance remains underpenetrated with growing populations of middle-class requiring products across the health and protection, savings and wealth spectrum.’

The Pru was founded in London, 173 years ago and listed in the London in 1978. Recently, it has undergone a radical overhaul.

Its former UK and European operations – now known as M&G – were successfully spun off and listed in 2019, with the Jackson separation revealed this year.

Its head office staff are in Hong Kong, but Wells said the company had no intention of closing its London base.

He said: ‘We’ve got a tremendously talented staff in London, and they face off with key stakeholders there . We’re not looking to get everybody in one building.’

Yesterday, the stock rose 2.6 per cent, or 38p, to 1489.5p.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A UN report describes the threat of global warming as ‘unprecedented’ and warns that heatwaves, floods and drought will be more frequent and intense in the next 20 years.

And homes account for 15 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, official statistics reveal, with 19 million below a ‘C’ in their Energy Performance Certificates — the Government’s rating for homes.

‘Climate change will affect future mortgage applications,’ says David McGrail of First Mortgage. ‘When you consider subsidence can knock 20 per cent off a home’s value — about £50,000 of the average price — it can have an impact, and make you more at risk of negative equity.’

Climate fight: Homes account for 15 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, statistics reveal, yet 19 million in Britain fall below a ‘C’ in the Government's Energy Performance Certificates

Some new homes are ahead of the game. But if you have an older home, there’s still plenty you can do to save energy — and money. Here’s how . . .

Improve insulation

Poor insulation leads to 45 per cent of heat loss. Cavity wall insulation stores heat within inner walls, while loft insulation sits between joists.

You can have floor insulation, too. Some homes will be eligible for the Energy Company Obligation grant. See powercompare.co.uk.

Cost? This varies, depending on house size, but £500 to £1,000 is a good start. Consumer body Which? and the Energy Saving Trust calculate you could pay for it with reduced energy bills after five years.

Save with solar

Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, that is stored and used in your home. It cuts power bills and some people even sell ‘spare’ electricity to the National Grid under the Smart Export Guarantee tariffs scheme.

Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, that is stored and used in your home. It cuts power bills and some people even sell ‘spare’ electricity to the National Grid

A south-facing roof is best, unshaded by buildings between 10am and 4pm to get the maximum solar rays.

Cost? Typically about £5,000. It may take 20 years or even more to recoup its cost in electricity bill savings at existing rates.

Go for glazing

Double or triple glazing will help cut energy bills, but if the windows are south facing they may magnify the effect of sunshine, and overheat a room.

No more than double glazing is advised if a room is in direct sunlight for many hours a day.

Cost? Website Double Glazing On The Web says triple glazing a two-bedroom home would cost £2,000 on average and up to £7,000 for a larger house. Double glazing can cost up to 70 per cent of that.

Low-energy lighting

Replacing all bulbs in your home with LED lights could cut carbon dioxide emissions by 75 per cent. Over a year that’s the equivalent of a car being driven 140 miles. It’s now illegal to make halogen lights but old stock can still be sold and the bulbs are found in ovens, cooker hoods and security lights. Try to avoid these.

Cost? LED bulbs typically last three times longer than traditional bulbs.

Upgrade your boiler

The older the boiler, the less efficient it is; if yours is rated D, E, F or G (as opposed to higher-rated A, B or C) then a new one could save you substantial sums and give off less carbon dioxide.

Cost? For a new boiler, expect to pay £2,500 to £3,500. See which.co.uk.

Pump it up

Ground source heat pumps are pipes buried in the garden to extract heat, which is then circulated into the house for radiators, underfloor systems and water.

Cost? The Energy Saving Trust says a ground source heat pump can cost £10,000 to £18,000.

Savings depend on what existing energy supply is being replaced. You could save £1,050 a year on average if you currently rely on old storage heaters.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britons ordering products from overseas are still being hit with big fees by courier, UPS, on their doorsteps - with many unable to find out exactly why.

Whilst there has been an increase in charges since the UK left the EU, with customers now potentially having to pay VAT themselves, higher customs duty and handling charges, other fees are being added on with no explanation.

This is Money previously reported that these charges can reach into the hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds with customers asked to pay up by UPS on their doorstep - or else they will take the parcel away.

In response, a raft of readers contacted us to say they had the same experience, all stating they were given absolutely no explanation for the charges they were handed.

Many UPS customers are still being charged extra 'fees' that the courier cannot explain

Some say the charges listed on the invoice were in the guise of VAT and customs duty, however, the sums didn't add up and when challenged, UPS could not offer an explanation as to what the fees were for.

Others said they were not given an invoice at all, so had no idea they had charges to pay until they were contacted by debt collection agencies.

Despite questioning the amount charged, many said they paid up, as they were concerned about their parcel being returned to the country it came from – or receiving further charges.

One reader, Dominic, said: 'In February this year I ordered some computer parts from a UK retailer who are actually based in Germany.

'The parcel arrived and was delivered by UPS who told me that I had to pay £66.63 in cash or card over the phone. I paid over the phone as I was told if I didn't then it would be sent back to the supplier.

'Shortly afterwards I received a copy of the invoice from the retailer and it clearly showed that I'd paid VAT when I made the purchase and the delivery was free of charge.

'I was confused as I'd been charged "fees" but had nothing to explain what they were and nothing to other than a record on my bank statement to show that I had paid them.'

He said he has tried to contact UPS multiple times but cannot get through on the phone or get a response via email leaving him with little options when trying to get his money back.

This is Money asked UPS why he was unable to get his money back. It said the package was correctly rated for import charges by UPS upon entry into the UK.

However, Dominic paid VAT twice against the shipment because of an error made by the shipper in Germany.

It said it will now be in touch with Dominic to get this rectified.

Meanwhile, other readers said they returned their items after learning how high the delivery cost and other charges were.

However, they were then still charged for the item being returned overseas instead.

Customer, Renee, said: 'I ordered 20 packets of crisps from Belguim for a total cost of €70. However, UPS asked me for an additional £207 in customs and tax charges.

'Needless to say I rejected the parcel. UPS were useless in explaining how it was possible I was being asked to pay £207 for goods worth just €70. Yet they still want the £207.'

UPS delivery drivers have been asking customers to pay for their parcels on their doorsteps

Another reader, Alvyn, added: 'I ordered an item from a company in Germany. When I realised there would be customs and VAT charges costing more than ordering the item in UK I contacted the company to cancel the order.

'They advised me to refuse the delivery and it would be returned to them. I declined the delivery from UPS and I have confirmation the item was received back to the company and they have refunded my payment.

'However I have now received an invoice of £61.70 from UPS for an item that was never delivered and was returned unopened to Germany.'

Some of the fees customers are receiving appear to be disbursement fees, which, according to UPS' website, are given to customers in instances when the courier prepays duties, taxes and other government charges on behalf of the payer.

Others are receiving late fees when a customer has not paid the amount on a UPS invoice by the date it has set.

What are the correct charges? There are now a number of fees that customers must pay when receiving deliveries from overseas, thanks to Brexit. These include VAT, customs duty, handling fees and return charges. To find out exactly what you should be paying - and what might not be right, click here.

On top of the late payment charge, customers may also be charged interest, meaning the fees could quickly rack up.

Other fees are simply deemed as 'government charges' on UPS invoices.

When trying to ascertain exactly what the fees are in regards to, consumers said it has been very difficult to get any answers from UPS, with customer service agents unable to explain why they have received the charges.

When This is Money asked the courier about whether customers should be charged for refusal of delivery, it said it was 'difficult to give a clear answer' without looking at each case individually due to the many different types of shipments it carries.

It added there are some examples when the recipient may be liable for additional charges, even if he or she refuses delivery, for example, where a recipient directs delivery to a third party or in certain circumstances where a third party accepts delivery on behalf of the recipient in the absence of the recipient requesting this.

However, several readers say they never received any communication from UPS so did not know they were due to pay anything.

Meanwhile, in regards to customs charges, UPS said it helps customers move their goods 'smoothly across borders'.

It is not just unknown charges that are proving problematic for customers with other consumers chased by debt collection agencies for not paying their UPS invoices.

Lesley is one such reader who has been contacted by a debt collection agency on behalf of UPS after ordering a gold 1oz Britannia coin from Germany.

She said: 'Shortly after my parcel arrived I got a strange telephone call from a gentleman saying he wanted to assist me with my investment but at no point did he state he was calling from UPS.

'Thinking this to be a scam, I was extremely vague and denied having received a gold coin. Soon after I received a form from UPS, via email asking me to fill in a customs declaration for HMRC.

'Now I have received a letter from a debt collection agency asking for £315 as they say the form was not collected at time of delivery and I had failed to pay the subsequent charge I was billed.

'I have not had a bill from UPS prior to this and I understood that a Gold Brittania is not subject to VAT or import duty and the company I purchased the gold from in Germany had already covered the postage costs.'

Customers said they struggled to get through to anyone at UPS for help understanding bills

This is Money sent this case to UPS which replied: 'Customer satisfaction is important to us. The situation has now been rectified, and we regret any inconvenience this may have caused.'

It confirmed the shipment was incorrectly rated and no charges should have been applied.

Meanwhile, another reader Peter, who is profoundly deaf, also had issues with having fees added after ordering several victorian coins from America.

He was told he was required by UPS to pay £2,480.72, for the 20 per cent VAT on invoice value, before it would deliver the coins.

He made the payment but after investigating realised he had been massively overcharged, as the correct VAT rate for 'collectors items of numismatic interest' is only 5 per cent - meaning he was overcharged by £1,860.54.

As he cannot speak on the phone, he has relied on emails which haven't been answered.

This is Money contacted UPS which said the shipment was rated incorrectly and should have been 5 per cent.

It said it was working to reclaim this payment and will be in touch with Peter on this if it needs additional information.

As reported by This is Money previously, many customers are being charged for investment gold pieces to be delivered, despite the fact they shouldn't have to pay charges.

There should be no VAT on investment gold and no Capital Gains Tax on any British Legal Tender coins, gold or silver.

Despite this, many consumers are still being wrongly charged by UPS when it comes to these deliveries.

Other people have taken to social media to share their frustration with the delivery company.

This Twitter user said his UPS driver expected payment but he wasn't told in advance

Another user said he is not being handed his item until he pays duty but doesn't know how

One UPS customer said his VAT charge was over 20% but he hasn't been told why this is

It is also proving to not just be a UK problem with similar charges being applied to consumers in other European countries receiving parcels from the UK.

Reader, Leny, said: 'My father lives in France and I have sent him parcels containing clothing and dry goods on many occasions.

'Since Brexit I have sent three parcels and each time he has been charged more for import charges, when the goods have a value of £50 and are a gift.

'The most recent charge from UPS is shocking. My dad had to give the driver €30 In cash and received no invoice or receipt at all.'

Overall, every case taken by This is Money to UPS was proven to have incorrect fees attached, highlighting the ongoing problem for consumers.

To find out which charges are correct and which should be challenged, click here.

Courier behaviour has been criticised by Citizens Advice which recently called for fines for delivery companies after saying the way parcels are delivered is not fit for purpose.

It said, despite a large number of people not receiving their deliveries, the majority of couriers receive no penalty for lost or stolen deliveries.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Talks to get the US investment giant Apollo on board to finance a bid to buy Morrisons have cooled after a shock increase in the offer price earlier this month.

New York-based Apollo had been lined up to join a takeover consortium led by the private equity firm Fortress.

But market sources this weekend said they believed Apollo had baulked at the dramatic £400million price increase for the supermarket chain.

Fortress increased its offer from £6.3billion to £6.7billion nine days ago in a highly unusual pre-emptive strike to gazump its rival Clayton Dubilier & Rice, advised by former Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy.

Bad connection: New York-based Apollo had been lined up to join a takeover consortium led by the private equity firm Fortress

CD&R had apparently been scrambling to put together a counter offer before Fortress increased its price.

It has until this Friday to respond to the raised offer after applying to the Takeover Panel for more time.

CD&R is understood to still be working towards the possibility of a knockout counter bid – which would force Fortress back to the drawing board.

Fortress, which is owned by the Japanese investment company SoftBank, has joined forces with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Koch family – US billionaires known for their conservative activism.

Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, also joined the consortium late last month, providing the Fortress consortium with extra firepower.

It was not clear this weekend whether a deal with Apollo would be reached.

The fund giant had initially looked at making its own offer for Morrisons before it was revealed last month that it might join the Fortress consortium. Other sources said Apollo could yet join the bid.

In June, CD&R offered £5.5billion for Morrisons, but this was flatly refused by the board, which includes two former colleagues of Leahy.

Andy Higginson, former finance chief at Tesco, is chairman and Morrisons chief executive David Potts was once considered to be a possible successor to Leahy when the retailer-turned-investment adviser signalled his intention to leave the retailer in 2010.

Shareholders initially rounded on the decision to sell to Fortress at its opening price of £2.54 a share.

Investor JO Hambro called on suitors to pay £2.70 while M&G said the offer price did not reflect 'the true value' of the company.

Its largest shareholder Silchester – with a 15 per cent stake – had said it was 'not inclined to support' the lower price. It has so far not commented on the raised offer.

Future, which also owns Marie Claire and football magazine FourFourTwo, is in 'advanced' discussions with the private equity owners of Dennis Publishing about a takeover of a large number of the company's most well-known publications.

A report by Sky News suggested a £300million deal could be announced as early as this week.

Hot off the press: Future is in 'advanced' discussions with the private equity owners of Dennis Publishing about a takeover of a large number of the company's most well-known publications

Other Dennis titles that could fall into Future's hands include MoneyWeek and Kiplinger's Personal Finance.

However, the report said Future won't be acquiring Viz, the satirical magazine.

Dennis Publishing is owned by Exponent, a UK-based private equity firm. The buyout shop hired bankers from Liontree Advisors earlier this year to find a buyer for some or all of Dennis Publishing.

Reports suggest that Future has been battling it out for Dennis Publishing with other media giants such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.

Future is led by Zillah Byng-Thorne, under whose leadership the company has expanded rapidly into a digitally-led media business and launched a series of daring takeovers.

Last year, it bought price comparison website GoCompare for £594million.

A spokesman for Future declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ambitious carpet and flooring supplier Likewise Group will this week list on AIM with a plan to triple sales.

The firm has agreed to raise £10million from investors, valuing it at £50 million, to fund growth and distribution centres across the UK.

Likewise is run by Tony Brewer, who for 16 years ran flooring supply giant Headlam, which has a current market value of £436million.

Roll with it: Likewise has agreed to raise £10million from investors, valuing it at £50 million, to fund growth and distribution centres across the UK

Likewise supplies independent retailers in the highly fragmented market, which is still dominated by 7,000 or so small, family-run operations.

Brewer said Likewise planned to grow its share of the £2billion-a-year market from 3 per cent to 10 per cent – equivalent to sales of about £200 million a year.

He said independents often sell and fit carpets and still thrive in a market where advice and understanding the technical specifications of products help customers decide which to buy.

'There's little or no barrier to setting up [a shop] in this market and with our help it can be made very easy,' he said.

Brewer has attracted several other former Headlam employees to work for him, including his finance director and commercial director.

The sale of shares dilutes his family stake in the business to about 25 per cent.

'But I don't take pride in always pretending I'm ok. It's not healthy. That old line 'it's ok not to be ok,' I wrote it because it's true and I still believe this platform is to inspire through truth.

'To anyone else going through a testing time. I feel you. I see you. We will get through this. Love you all [heart emoji].'

Back in June, Jessie broke down in tears as she updated fans on her battle with Ménière's disease, a condition of the inner ear.

The singer shared a tearful video of herself quietly singing her new single I Want Love, revealing it had been requested by her a speech therapist to monitor her progress.

According to the NHS website, an attack of Ménière's disease may cause sufferers to feel like they or everything them you is spinning, lose their balance and feel sick.

Jessie also revealed she had been diagnosed with having acid reflux and vocal nodules, painful lumps on the vocal chords that can have a devastating impact on singing.

Promising her fans to be 'honest' with her post, Jessie penned: 'I was asked to send a speech therapist a video of me singing something quietly, so she could hear my voice.

'I'm in pain every day': Back in June, Jessie broke down in tears as she updated fans on her battle with Ménière's disease, a condition of the inner ear

'(I am not naked I am wearing a boob tube. Well more of a tube in my case) I'm laughing. Thank god. We gotta laugh.

'The first song I sang was I want love. Just hearing myself sing it and feel so vulnerable whilst singing bought me to tears.

'I have never ever to this day (since recording it) been able to to sing it because of the pain I am experiencing. Man it's been hard not singing.

'It's literally my life line and my happiness. Being quiet is not something I'm good at. Or makes me feel like myself. Lord knows I'm loud af.

'It was in that moment I knew I needed to be honest with myself and honest with you all about where I am at and explain what is going on…

'To be totally real, to have your support and love would help me get through this faster I'm sure

'I've always been honest however hard it feels. It's important to be strong enough to be weak. Especially on a platform like this.'

Jessie then took to her Stories to share a more detailed analysis of her problems, revealing that as well as battling Ménière's disease, she had struggled with singer's nodules.

Vocal nodules are hard, rough, noncancerous growths on your vocal cords that can be caused by overusing your voice and continue to grow if the voice isn't rested.

The growths can prevent vocal cords from vibrating normally, which in turn changes the pitch and tone of your voice.

Jessie revealed her problems first began in February when she began to feel a constant burning sensation in her throat, which she initially put down to fatigue from recording.

However, the singer then began to suffer with major acid reflux and nodules and was prescribed antacid and a cocktail of other medications, but to no avail.

Jessie then revealed she had to endure having eight cameras going down her nose and examinations from six different doctors, who were left stumped by the cause.

The singer added that she was then put on an extremely strict diet which saw her eat 'the same six foods for three months'.

Jessie did not specify if the doctors put her on the diet to help with her Ménière's disease, with some sufferers claiming their symptoms improve by eating a low-salt diet, avoiding alcohol and avoiding caffeine.

Shocking: Jessie then revealed she had to endure having eight cameras going down her nose and examinations from six different doctors, who were left stumped by the cause

Feeling good: Despite being left physically and emotionally drained by the process, Jessie vowed to remain positive

The BRIT-winning artist added that she also had her bloods taken, throat swabs, acupuncture massages and soul work, but confessed she was 'still in the same pain every day'.

After being told to rest and reduce all her talking and singing, Jessie's nodules disappeared, but she has been warned by doctors that singing again will cause them to return.

She added there has still not been any reasoning provided for her problems with acid reflux.

Jessie revealed: 'I'm still seeing different doctors and doing everything I can to resolve it, I promise you that.'

Despite being left physically and emotionally drained by the process, Jessie vowed to remain positive.

She explained: 'My biggest lesson my whole life has been my health. And I'm in it. Living it. This is my real life and I know I'm being faced with this because I can handle it. It could be so much worse'.

She added that she would be taking a step back from plugging her single as she 'refuses' to mime but hoped fans could appreciate her honesty.

What are vocal nodules? Vocal nodules are hard, rough, noncancerous growths on your vocal cords. They can be as small as a pinhead or as large as a pea. You get nodules from straining or overusing your voice, especially from singing, yelling, or talking loudly or for a long period of time. Vocal nodules go by other names based on their cause. They've been called singing nodules, screamer's nodules, and teacher's nodules. Vocal nodules change the sound of your voice, making it: hoarse; raspy or scratchy; tired-sounding; breathy; crack or break; lower-pitched than usual Singers can have a hard time reaching higher octaves because nodules reduce their range. Some people lose their voice entirely. Pain is another common symptom of nodules. It may feel like: a shooting pain that goes from ear to ear, neck pain, a lump stuck in your throat Treatment starts with vocal rest. Voice therapy is another part of treatment. You also need to get treated for any medical conditions that may have caused your vocal nodules, such as: acid reflux; allergies; sinusitis or thyroid problems If your vocal nodules don't go away after a few weeks or they're very large, you may need surgery to remove them.

She said: 'I don't always get it out but I am honest and I hope you can respect that. Love you all... Stress will only make it worse. And speaking my truth since I was a little girl helps with my stress of anything.'

After pouring her heart out to her followers, Jessie penend: 'Your comments are making me cry. Your support inspires me to keep pushing. Thank you thank you thank you'.

Jessie first spoke about her battle with Meniere's disease last year after sharing a selfie in hospital at Christmas.

Amid a list of things she'd done that day, the star told how she was forced to watch television with a finger in her ear as she described how her illness felt.

She told her Instagram followers: 'I woke up and felt like I was completely deaf in my right ear, couldn't walk in a straight line.

'Basically I got told I had Meniere's syndrome. I know that a lot of people suffer from it and I've actually had a lot of people reach out to me and give me great advice, so I've just been laying low in silence.

'Now's the first time I've been able to sing and bear it. I just miss singing so much and being around anyone.'

Describing her symptoms she said: 'I haven't sung for so long and when I sing loud, it sounds like there's someone trying to run out of my ear.'

Jessie went on to reveal that her ear 'sounds like someone crawled in and turned a hair dryer on'.

Jessie has always been candid with fans about her health woes, previously revealing that she can't conceive children naturally.

The former Voice Kids judge told fans she discovered she had fertility issues nearly five years ago and detailed her 'pain and sadness' at the situation as she took to the stage at London's Royal Albert Hall in late 2018.

Jessie previously penned a song called Four Letter Word to help other people in her situation so they don't feel alone in a speech at one of her concerts.

Jessie said, according to Metro.co.uk: 'I was told four years ago that I can't ever have children.

'I don't tell you guys for sympathy because I'm one of millions of women and men that have gone through this and will go through this.

'It can't be something that defines us but I wanted to write this song for myself in my moment of pain and sadness but also to give myself joy, to give other people something that they can listen to in that moment when it gets really hard.

'So if you've ever experienced anything with this or have seen somebody else go through it or have lost a child, then please know you're not alone in your pain and I'm thinking of you when I sing this song.'

Struggles: The Flashlight singer disclosed her illness on a recent Instagram live in which she revealed that she struggled to hear, sing or even walk in a straight line (pictured in 2020)

Jessie has made no secret of her desire to have children, with the Bang Bang hitmaker previously telling The Mirror: 'I still believe in miracles. And as women know, it sometimes doesn't just happen, it's a process.

'The reason I spoke about it before wasn't for sympathy and it still isn't, it's to just be open about it.'

The media personality is currently in a relationship with dancer Max Pham Nguyen.

She confirmed her new romance in February, four months after splitting from Channing Tatum.

Songstress Jessie and Magic Mike hunk Channing had rekindled their romance in April 2020 after calling it quits in 2019.

Jessie has just released her new single I Want Love, which sets the stage for her long-awaited fifth full-length album, which will be released later this year.

Back in 2011, Jessie J quietly emerged with the biggest voice in pop when she released Who You Are, which went platinum.

The record also made history as the first album by a British female artist to produce six or more Top 10 hits in the UK, while she picked up the 2011 Critics' Choice BRIT Award and BBC's Sound of 2011.

On its heels, 2014's Sweet Talker crashed the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 200 and housed the eight-times platinum Bang Bang with Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.

The JLS singer, 33, took to Instagram to share candid before and after snaps as he marked the half way point of a gruelling 12-week exercise regime and strict diet.

He looked incredible in the second snap as he showed off his rippling abs and toned frame while posing for the camera.

Wow! Aston Merrygold showed off his impressive body transformation on Sunday after revealing he had gotten into the 'worst shape he's ever been in'

In the caption he penned how he was suffering with low confidence and felt sluggish and tired as well as struggling to even lift up his kids due to his poor fitness levels.

He wrote: 'A few months ago I had got myself in the worst shape I’ve EVER been in! Confidence was low, I felt sluggish, tired, useless and was unhappy ever time I looked in a mirror…

'And the worst part was I had severe ligament damage to my shoulder which left me in daily pain! It was easy to let excuse after excuse stop me from changing it.. but one morning I woke up and just HAD to change it!'

Fit: He looked incredible in the second snap as he showed off his rippling abs and toned frame while posing for the camera

He went on to explain how he took action: 'I started a 12 week programme which I’ve been going hard for 6 weeks.. Eating clean and training as hard as I can (shoulder is still ropey, but we move) and I’m feeling strong, more confident and happier within myself than I have in years!

'I rarely show any side other than confidence being someone that came into the entertainment industry at a young age.. having thick skin was always easy for me.. but looking at my kids on a daily basis and getting to the point I was struggling to even lift them was killing me!!! So I made a promise to myself I will NEVER let that happen!

He signed off by saying: 'I’m focused and waking up everyday thankful, blessed and wanting to be a better version of myself than the day before! So big up everybody that is hustling, working, fighting and striving to be better.'

It comes after earlier this month Aston blasted Liam Payne for blaming his mental health issues on being in One Direction.

Liam, 27, previously cited the 'toxic and difficult' environment of being in the boyband for being a detriment on this mental health.

However, Aston who also found fame in a band, JLS, called out the claims, saying that it 'comes with the job, you sign away your privacy' and that Liam should have understood that fame comes with a price.

Liam previously revealed that he had difficulty adjusting to the lifestyle and had a hard time being locked up in hotel rooms while on tour.

'You sign away your privacy': It comes after earlier this month Aston blasted Liam Payne for blaming his mental health issues on being in One Direction; pictured in 2021

Both singers found fame on the X-Factor, and Aston told The Sun that there were other reasons why the band were not allowed out and it may have had something to do with safety, with fans bombarding hotels.

He said: 'You are your own boss. It’s not that you were not allowed to do something. He was in the biggest band on the planet and there were thousands of people outside the hotel. So it was probably a safety thing.'

Aston continued: 'It comes with the job. You sign away your privacy. I think you should expect everything, expect it all and say, "This is what I want to work for".

'If you don’t want any of those things then you should not start it because it (the downside) does come and when it does come there are going to be bits that you don’t like.'

Hard times: Liam previously cited the 'toxic and difficult' environment of being in the world's biggest boyband was detrimental on this mental health; pictured in July 2021

MailOnline has contacted Liam's representatives for comment.

JLS - formed of Aston, Oritsé Williams, Marvin Humes, and JB Gill - appeared on The X Factor in 2008 and finished as runners-up

Meanwhile, the members of One Direction - Liam, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Zayn Malik - were joined together on the talent show two years later and finished in third place.

Despite not winning the show, the boys were catapulted to fame and ended up becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time before they split in 2015, with all five members going on to pursue solo music careers.

Liam has spoken openly in the past about his own struggles with mental health, revealing he battled suicidal thoughts after finding fame, and saying he went through a 'pills and alcohol phase' when he was in the band.

'For some certain circumstances I'm quite lucky to be here still,' he told Sky One's Straight Talking with Ant Middleton.

'There are times when that level of loneliness and people getting into you every day, it's like, "When will this end?" That's almost nearly killed me a couple of times.'

Meanwhile, JLS are set to release new music and it was revealed that they signed a new record deal earlier this year, eight years after their split.

The boyband revealed they’ve already got several singles lined up for fans in 2021.

Speaking about their exciting comeback plans in an interview with The Sun, Marvin explained that after their reunion tour was postponed amid the pandemic the band were able to get 'writing and recording'.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Most British holidaymakers were previously resigned to the fact that they won't be able to head abroad this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic causing travel havoc.

However, reports suggest that the Government is mulling potential 'air bridge' countries which could see Brits head abroad to low-infection countries without facing quarantine on their return to the UK.

With this in mind, foreign holidays could soon be back on the table, and that means sorting out holiday money.

Swipe your everyday credit card or debit card abroad and you will end up paying through the nose, as most charge an extra 3 per cent for the privilege.

On holiday? Relax and make sure you're not spending too much on fees

But there are ways to avoid extra costs when making purchases or withdrawing money abroad.

Here we pick the best accounts which offer small or, even better, no fees - a worthwhile money-saver, particularly if you are a frequent-flyer.

While it is hard to predict what rates will do in the future, the pound plummeted against both the US dollar and the euro haven't returned to pre-Brexit vote levels, hitting travellers' wallets hard.

Now it is more important than ever to avoid hefty fees from your bank to make sure your cash stretches as far as possible while on holiday.

Current accounts

They may be free to use at home, but debit cards can be serious offenders when it comes to extra holiday costs.

Some providers charge as much as £1.50 every time you use your card on top of loading the exchange rate.

Big charges mean that you should avoid taking out small amounts of cash often and try to take out larger amounts less regularly, although this brings its own risks in terms of theft.

Luckily, if you don't want to pay out to spend, there are a few options out there that can help you to avoid extra costs.

Starling - the best of the bunch but you have to bank via an app

Starling was the first of the challengers to launch an app-only current account in the UK.

While banking on your mobile might not be for everyone, the free overseas spending and withdrawals everywhere in the world might be enough to persuade you - a perk unavailable anywhere else.

Rival challenger Monzo previously offered the same deal, but it has since added a cap on free overseas withdrawals of £200 per month, with a 3 per cent charge after that.

There are no guarantees Starling will be able to sustain its free withdrawals, but it is currently the cheapest account on the market for overseas spending and withdrawals.

The app lets you categorise your spending, freeze your card temporarily if you lose it and set up savings goals.

Watch out for

If you stray into your overdraft there are no usage fees, but interest will be applied at 15 EAR per cent. If you use an unauthorsied overdraft, there are no extra fees on top of standard interest and charges are capped at £2 per month.

Any others?

Those who pay for Nationwide's FlexPlus current account also get fee-free spending and withdrawals abroad, but you pay £13 per month for the packaged account.

You can find out more about whether its worth stumping up the cash for this account in our roundup of the top paid-for current accounts.

Selfie banking: Metro says customers can open accounts online within 10 minutes - and it means you don't need to go into branch

Metro Bank - free in Europe

Metro Bank's current account is a relatively small newcomer, proud of its customer-centric approach to banking. Its current account is a straightforward, no-frills option.

Metro has a few branches, but mostly in London and the south east, but it also allows online applications. The bank also has a mobile banking tool with beefed-up budgeting features.

No overseas charges in Europe

Metro Bank will not charge you for using your card or withdrawing money from an ATM abroad in Europe, but it will charge you for use in the rest of the world.

It will charge 2.99 per cent on both card purchases and ATM withdrawals.

Watch out: Cash withdrawals abroad often come with flat fees of up to £1.50 each

Credit cards

Most cards add around 3 per cent cost to the exchange rates banks themselves get.

You can avoid this by picking a specialist card, which won't apply non-sterling transaction fees or cash withdrawal charges.

Watch out: Most providers will charge interest on cash withdrawals immediately, until you pay off the amount in full.

To avoid clocking up interest therefore avoid leaving it until you get home to pay off the balance after using an ATM.

More to spend: Saving money on spending and cash fees means you will have extra for your trip

Halifax

Halifax Clarity credit card has long been a popular option for no-frills overseas spending.

Halifax demands no extra charges for spending abroad anywhere or any extra for withdrawing cash at home and abroad.

Standard interest is set at 19.9 per cent - there are a few options (below) which have lower interest rates on spending.

But it's a Mastercard which means conversion rates are much better.

There is no annual fee - so there are zero extra costs as long as you pay off your balance in full every month.

Additional cards on the same account are available and you can manage your account online.

Watch out for

Interest is charged immediately at the card’s standard rate of 19.95 per cent on cash withdrawals and purchases abroad, but you can minimise the cost by repaying in full as soon as possible.

Depending on your credit score, applicants may be given a higher interest rate of 27.9 per cent.

You will be charged £12 if you pay your balance late, have a payment returned or go over your limit.

Water sports: Credit card fees can push up the cost of paying for holiday activities

The best of the rest

Santander

Santander's Zero Credit Card again has no overseas fees for spending or withdrawing cash from an ATM anywhere in the world.

There is no monthly fee and a standard interest rate of 18.9 per cent.

Tandem

Tandem's Journey credit card charges nothing for purchases and withdrawals abroad. Interest on any withdrawals will be applied immediately.

It comes with interest of 24.9 per cent and is designed for those who need to build up their credit rating with starting credit limits of £500 - £1,500.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Blue Whale fund has delivered sparkling performance since its launch just over two years ago, but its manager is also looking to protect his investors if a downturn arrives.

Manager Stephen Yiu looks for the 30 best companies in the world and says that were we to go into recession tomorrow, he would be comfortable that they could still deliver returns.

With the fund becoming an investor's darling thanks to its strong returns, how it would fare in a downturn or if the US stock market it is heavily invested in tumbles, should be a key question for investors.

So what has been the secret to Blue Whale’s start-up success and where is the fund investing now?

On this episode of the Investing Show, its manager Stephen Yiu joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter to discuss its performance.

He talks about the companies that he is backing, why he believes the US still holds great opportunities and how he seeks to protect his investors from shares that face risks – and overvaluation.

In fact, the manager argues that element of caution is one of the reasons why Blue Whale didn't do even better last year and fell slightly behind rival funds with a riskier stance.

Stephen also talks about why he thinks that across the board how he decides when to sell a company.

The Blue Whale fund has delivered strong performance since its launch, but manager Stephen Yiu says it is also position to protect investors

Investors in the Blue Whale, managed by Stephen Yiu and backed by Peter Hargreaves, were rewarded with a 26.1 per cent return in 2019.

In a year of strong stock market returns that was only enough to put the fund in 46th position in the 314-strong global fund field, but Blue Whale is keen to stress that looked at since launch it is the top performer.

Those like Hargreaves, one of the founders of investing platform giant Hargreaves Lansdown, who invested at the start have been rewarded with a healthy 42.6 per cent return in two years, compared to the 20.3 per cent return delivered by the average global fund.

The £225million Blue Whale fund has ongoing charges of 0.89 per cent.

What will 2020 hold for investors?

Britain’s investors have started 2020 with the tailwind of a decisive election victory seen as a boost for the UK stock market.

But they also face headwinds from everything ranging from the US and Iran stand-off, question marks over an America and China trade deal, and a potential bumpy landing on Brexit, as finally leaving the EU on 31 January gives way to months of wrangling with Europe over our future relationship.

Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter look at the outlook for investors, the company shares that have bounced since the election, and the prospects for gains continuing.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Smaller company shares have delivered the best long-term returns, research shows, but investors must be prepared for volatility along the way.

Research by Paul Marsh and Scott Evans of the London Business School showed that a £1 investment in the Numis Small Companies Index at its starting point in 1955 would have been worth £6,417 by the end of 2018, with dividends reinvested.

The same investment in the FTSE All-Share would have yielded just £991.

But while the FTSE All-Share delivered a total return of minus 9.5 per cent last year, the small cap index lost 11 per cent.

There will be many investors who saw small caps in their portfolios lose far more than that, with bad news regularly rewarded by 20 to 30 per cent drops in share prices.

So how can you sift through the small companies to find the gems and cut the chance of things going wrong

Top fund manager, Gresham House's Ken Wotton's micro-cap fund fell just 1.3 per cent last year compared to the average fund's 8.8 per cent decline and has delivered a total return of 66.5 per cent over five years compared to the average fund's 41 per cent. He explains how he finds the best small cap shares and reduces risk.

Can the stock market continue its decent start to 2019?

After a tough 2018 and December for investors, January has proved a better month, so will 2019 be a better year overall?

Now Britain has been told that new petrol and diesel engine cars will not be allowed to be sold in just nine years’ time.

But the car itself isn’t going anywhere – just the way it is propelled and hybrids will still be allowed – so how much difference will the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars make?

Is the rise of the electric car inevitable anyway and even with Brexit is it more important what Germany, France and the rest of Europe choose to do, than what the UK decides?

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Lee Boyce and Simon Lambert talk electric cars: from what the shift to them means, to what they are like to drive, charge and live with.

Simon explains his experiences of charging electric cars without a home wallbox and why he thinks the Government needs to buck its ideas up on public charging and stop making policy only for those with a drive.

He also talks through what three popular electric cars, the Renault Zoe, Peugeot 208 and Tesla Model 3 are like to drive and why the Porsche Cayenne with a conscience shows the way forward for those who feel they need a big, fast, luxury SUV.

Also on this week’s podcast, the team discuss yet more pain for savers and the chaos at major port Felixstowe and why it matters to businesses and consumers.

But is this a good idea or a bad plan?

Is more help just what first-time buyers could do with, or is inflating the property market with more cheap money the last thing we need?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I bought a van from a Renault garage and was quoted to pay £16,000 plus VAT, making it a total of £19,200.

Renault offered to pay £13,800 for my existing van, leaving me to pay £5,400 which I did so at the dealership.

However, within an hour of leaving, I received a call from the salesman informing me that he had undercharged me for the van and I still owed £2,300.

A Renault customer signed a contract and paid for a van but then was asked to pay more

I told him I would need to take advice before paying but he rang me back an hour later on his mobile saying the offer had been reduced to £1,700 and I had to pay or I would have to return the vehicle and take a refund.

Should I pay even though I had already signed the contract and paid the original asking price? J.R., via email

Grace Gausden, consumer expert at This is Money, replies: This situation almost drove you to despair after Renault tried to reverse the deal, even though you had already paid.

While looking for a replacement for your existing Renault Kangoo Formula Edition van, you contacted a number of dealerships before settling on a deal with Renault for a Kangoo Business+ edition as it was one of the better offers.

Overall, you would have to pay £5,400 after subtracting the £13,800 Renault would pay you for your van.

After agreeing to the deal, you were also made an offer of £13,500 by someone else looking to purchase your van.

However, as the dealership had offered you £300 more than the private sale, you decided to part exchange it.

After paying the difference in the dealership as well as paying out for a road fund licence and private numberplate, you agreed you would pick up the van the next day.

But an hour after payment, a salesman from Renault rang you to say you had been undercharged and owed an additional £2,300 which understandably came as a shock.

You told the salesman you wanted to seek counsel about this but within the hour you had a further phone call, this time via the salesman's personal mobile.

He said he had made an error when adding up the price on your new van and had added VAT to the part exchange offer when the price should have not included the extra 20 per cent.

As such, while Renault originally were going to give you £13,800 inclusive of VAT on your van, they were now offering £11,500 - the price without VAT.

This left you owing them £7,700 overall - £5,400 of which you had already paid, meaning you needed to stump up an additional £2,300.

The salesman added he was in trouble with his boss and his job was on the line, putting added pressure on you to make the payment immediately.

You claim he said that Renault were prepared to take a hit on the deal and said they would settle for £1,700 or you could return the new vehicle and get a refund for the amount you had already paid.

What the reader paid What the original Renault contract said: Cost of van: £19,200 including VAT Part exchange price on your van: £13,800 including VAT Difference you paid: £5,400 What Renault then asked you to pay: Cost of van: £19,200 including VAT Part exchange price on your van: £11,500 not including VAT Difference to pay: £7,700 After the £5,400 you paid: £2,300 outstanding Amount reduced to £1,700: £5,400 plus £1,700 = £7,100.

The Renault customer was shocked when he was asked to pay even more for his new van

Again, you stated you would need time to think about this and would get back in touch.

Although Renault have reduced the amount, you feel that you have been misled by the French car manufacturer.

I could easily understand your frustration at being told to stump up thousands of pounds more after having already paid and signing the contract.

Therefore, I contacted Renault to see how this error had happened and how much you actually owed.

A spokesperson said: 'We are very disappointed to hear of Mr R's experience and apologise for the error.

'The mistake was due to the fact that the sales executive made a human error when calculating the VAT, therefore the dealership has rectified the mistake and taken on the loss.

'We apologise for the inconvenience caused.'

Fortunately, Renault said the dealership will take on the loss, meaning you now have your van and do not need to pay any more funds.

Shortly after you received a call from the salesman who had initially called you to say there was nothing else for you to pay, adding he had received a warning.

Luckily, Renault realised its mistake, and whilst mistakes do happen, you had already signed the contract and paid what you were asked to.

However, I imagine you are not in a rush to deal with the firm next time you are looking for a new vehicle.

An AA customer was shocked at the high price when she received her renewal quote

Hit and miss: This week's naughty and nice list

Each week, I look at some of the companies that have fallen short of expected standards as well as those that have gone that extra mile for customers.

Miss: This week, AA is under fire from reader, Sally, after she received a particularly high renewal quote.

She said: 'We have been a member of the AA for over 35 years but when our renewal quote came through it was £370.

'My husband looked online to join and the price for a new customer is £139. When he contacted the AA, it would only knock the premium down to £260.

'We have now had to cancel our membership and start all over again. Where is its customer loyalty service?'

I contacted AA about this to see why it was charging loyal customers nearly double what new customers had to pay.

However, AA refused to back down.

A spokesperson said: 'We believe all of our customers get a good deal at a fair price.

'We offer a market-leading breakdown service, which is rated in the highest possible way by customers, and our prices reflect the high quality of the service we provide.

'Like many providers and other subscription-based services, we do offer introductory discounts to encourage new customers to trial our services and we communicate these discounts at the point of purchase.

'We are grateful to Sally for her continued loyalty and are sorry that she was unhappy with her recent renewal quote. However, we are pleased to hear they remain happy with the service.'

It added that loyal customers receive extras such as, after the first year of breakdown cover, when members are given complimentary Silver benefits that are not available to new members and after five years, it provides further additional Gold benefits.

However, you say whilst you have these benefits, you would rather have a lower premium.

Sadly, you aren't the first to be hit by the loyalty penalty – and won't be the last. It's just a shame the AA didn't see fit to alter your premiums, leaving you to sign up again as new members.

Hit: In happier news, a reader, who wished to remain anonymous, got in touch to praise Marks & Spencer.

She said: 'I emailed M&S to say I was disappointed they only had granny-pant style bikini bottoms available with a bikini set I liked.

'They made me some bespoke bikini briefs to go with the set. Amazing customer service.'

M&S were certainly not pants in this situation and proved themselves by going the extra mile.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Romford has the highest rate of reported car thefts in the UK for a second year running, new research has revealed.

The 'RM' postcode has a car theft rate of 16.38 per 1,000 insurance enquiries in 2021 - an increase from 15.74 in 2020, according to data from Money Super Market and enough to top all other areas in the country.

Ilford and Barking were a close second with a rate of 15.71, again for a second consecutive year as thieves continue to target the same regions.

Hotspot: Romford is the place with the most car thefts in the UK for the second year in a row

Meanwhile, Dumfries and Galloway, located in Scotland's Western Southern Uplands, has the lowest rate of reported car thefts at 0.37 per 1,000 capita.

Money Super Market analysed millions of car insurance enquiries made on its site between 20 July 2020 and 20 July 2021 to identify the areas with the highest and lowest rates of reported car theft claims within a five-year period.

It found that Birmingham was the area with the third highest theft rate with 13.33 claims per 1,000 closely followed by North London with a rate of 12.61.

Enfield, Dudley and South West London also all made the list.

Meanwhile, Scottish locations dominate the ten safest areas for car theft with Kirkwall, Perth, Paisley and Galashiels all taking top positions.

Other areas with the lowest theft rate include the Isle of Man with a rate of 0.39 claims per 1,000 and Llandrindod Wells with a rate of 0.79.

South West towns Plymouth and Exeter also made the list.

When it comes to age, the research found drivers aged 30 to 39 are the most likely to report their car as stolen with a theft rate of 8.78 per 1,000 people whilst those aged 20 to 24 years face the least risk at a rate of 4.09.

This compares to 2020, where 40 to 49 year olds were most likely to face higher risk of car theft with a rate of 8.33.

The Ford Fiesta was the vehicle most targeted by thieves in 2020 with 3,392 reported cases, according to DVLA statistics, followed by the Land Rover Range Rover with 2,881 cases then the Volkswagen Golf at 1,975 cases.

Praksha Patel-Shah, car insurance expert at Money Super Market, said: 'Not only can where you live and park your car increase the likelihood of you experiencing car theft, but criminals are now becoming more inventive and sophisticated when it comes to modern vehicles, so extra preventions may be necessary.

'Our research shows that urban, built-up areas have the highest incidences of car theft, while more rural, remote areas tend to record fewer instances.

'Insurers do consider your location when providing you with a quote, so if you live in an area with a high theft rate, you might see this reflected in higher premiums.

'Regardless of your location, shopping around for a new car insurance policy can help reduce your costs significantly – in just a matter of minutes you could save up to £236 a year.'

Previous research conducted last month found that nine of the top ten locations for car theft are in the capital including the exclusive borough of Kensington and Chelsea as well as Ealing and Wandsworth, according to data collated by Co-Op Insurance.

It found that Preston was the only postcode in the north with car crime stats high enough to be placed within the top 20, sitting at number 13 in the list.

Meanwhile, correlating with the research conducted by Money Super Market, Moray in Scotland was found to have the least frequency of vehicle theft claims in four years.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Buying a piece of land and then designing and building your own home is a pipe dream for many.

But what if you want to turn it into reality? Where do you begin and what are the key things to consider?

We’re not talking about money here and your budget, but rather focusing instead on the process of finding a suitable site and planning permission.

We speak to James Firth, of estate agents Strutt & Parker, for his views on choosing a site and the best chances of securing planning consent.

The biggest mistake is rushing into a project without considering all the steps in the planning process, according to James Firth, of estate agents Strutt & Parker

1: Choosing the site

There are some areas that are better than others to consider if you're planning to build your own home.

Mr Firth explains, for example, that brownfield sites or land that is adjacent to existing development has a better chance of getting planning permission to build on.

'If you do not own the site, development sites can be taken forward on a subject-to-planning basis whereby completion only occurs once planning permission has been obtained,' he said.

2: Check the local plan and development zoning

It is important to check whether the desired land is suitable for building on or is it protected. If it is green belt land, it will have more restrictions.

Mr Firth said: 'The Government's planning reform measures will introduce additional zoning of land, including land for growth, renewal or protection.

'If the land is identified for growth or renewal, it is likely that an existing development will be there already, and will make it easier to move forward with a planning application.

If the land is zoned for protection, it will be more difficult. However, the Government Planning Reform hasn't yet come into play, and there is no fixed date for its roll out, but it is something to bear in mind.'

He added that the Government is also encouraging self-builds and requires local authorities to identify how the need for self-build properties will be met in their area.

3: Draw up plans and engage early with local planning officers

Engaging with the neighbours and local community will help reduce the risks of your planning project.

'This is the point at which you should engage with a planning expert.

'If you're looking to purchase land upon which to build, do some pre-application work to get some feedback from the local authority,' Mr Firth explained.

4: Consider the sustainability

National Planning Policy has recently been amended to give additional emphasis to climate change and sustainability considerations, Mr Firth points out.

'So considering how these can be incorporated into your build will carry significant weight in the planning process,' he said.

Minor scale applications could be decided by the council and the planning authority within eight weeks

5: Consider biodiversity

In a similar vein, Mr Firth explained that proposals are required to minimise impacts on and provide net gains for biodiversity.

'The Environment Act will also be bringing forward additional requirements,' he said.

'Consider the type of property you're building and whether you can incorporate some favourable sustainable features, such as planting trees or wildlife improvement to help secure planning.

6: Getting planning permission

Smaller scale projects are likely to be decided by a planning officer as a delegated decision, whereas some more controversial or larger scale proposals will go through to a planning committee for the council to vote on, according to Mr Firth.

He said: 'There is the option of an appeal to the planning inspectorate if it doesn't go in your favour.

'But above all, it's about focusing on the overall benefits of the proposal - from the design or environmental credentials - these are all taken into account in what's called 'the planning balance'.

'Minor scale applications could be decided by the council and the planning authority within eight weeks.

'However, it can take longer than this. If the time line is exceeded, there's something called a non-determination appeal to the planning inspectorate but this process can take considerably more time.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Winchester is the most expensive city in Britain to buy a home, with an average property price tag of £630,432, an astonishing 14 times higher than average local pay packets, new findings have revealed.

While there has been considerable talk about a mass exodus from urban hubs during the pandemic, some remain as popular as ever - and in many, prices have risen sharply.

The average cost of a city home has swelled by 10.3 per cent to £287,440 in the past year, while the average earnings of people living in them climbed by just 2.1 per cent, mortgage lender Halifax said in a report.

Costly: Winchester is the most expensive city in Britain to buy a home, with property price tags 14 times higher than local people's pay packets

London was outside the top five least affordable cities for the first time in six years.

With its impressive cathedral and quaint river mill, Winchester replaced Oxford as the most unaffordable city to snap up a property when average local earnings were taken into account.

Any prospective buyers looking for a home in Winchester can expect to pay around £630,432, which is 8 per cent more than last year, according to Halifax.

Across the country, the affordability of cities has deteriorated. Last year, house prices in cities typically cost around seven-and-a-half times wages.

There are, however, some more affordable options for buyers wanting a slice of urban life for a fraction of the price.

Londonderry in Northern Ireland held its position as the most affordable city for the third consecutive year, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 4.7. There, a property costs around £155,917.

Housing affordability improved in seven cities compared with a year earlier, namely Oxford, Carlisle, Portsmouth, Durham, Salford, Inverness and Glasgow.

Carlisle and Aberdeen are now more affordable than five years ago, with their house price-to-earnings ratios easing, Halifax said.

Inverness is the only city found to be more affordable than 10 years ago. An average home there costs 5.6 times average earnings, down from 6.2 in 2011, due to wage growth outstripping house price growth.

All of the most affordable cities have house prices below the average for all UK cities (£287,440), expect for Hereford, where property prices are around £316,929.

Halifax said: 'Despite Hereford being the most expensive location in the top 20, affordability there is boosted by average earnings of £48,048, almost £10,000 above the UK average.'

London is now outside the least affordable cities for the first time in six years, yet affordability in the capital has not improved. Average property prices rose by 5 per cent to £564,695 in Greater London, while earnings grew by 4 per cent, pushing London's price to earnings ratio up to 11, up from 10.9 last year.

Russell Galley, managing director, Halifax, said: 'Affordability is significantly better in the north and there are now just two cities – Plymouth and Portsmouth – with better than average affordability in the south.'

Summing up all its findings, Halifax said the average property price tag to earnings ratio in cities was 8.1. It has been increasing for the past eight years, and stood at 5.6 between 2011 and 2013.

Wages in cities are often higher than in rural areas, and during the pandemic a high number of city dwellers have relocated to the countryside, helping to push up house prices in many greener areas.

Across all parts of the country, the house price-to-earnings ratio is 8.5, with property prices at an average of £327,691.

The FTSE 250-listed defence group this month became a takeover target for two US firms.

Aerospace giant Parker-Hannifin put forward a £6.3billion, 800p-per-share bid earlier this month.

FTSE 250-listed defence group Meggitt this month became a takeover target for two US firms

But on Wednesday it was trumped by rival aerospace engineer Transdigm, which barged in on the pre-agreed deal by putting forward an informal offer of 900p per share, worth £7billion.

Transdigm boasts of having a private-equity-style model, which has raised alarm bells in the City about the long-term future for technology and staff.

Independent aerospace and defence analyst Howard Wheeldon said what was important with a buyout is how much a new owner is willing to invest in a firm.

He said: ‘Meggitt is certainly a great company and one that has many long-term strengths.

‘It deserves far better than being ultimately taken over by a company such as Transdigm that is happy to boast it has a private-equity-like structure and culture.

Parker-Hannifin has a culture and forward-looking investment approach very similar to that of Meggitt.’

Reborn sixties coachbuilder, Radford, has cemented its return today with the unveiling of its Lotus Type 62-2 sportscar to the public for the first time in America.

The 'Gold Leaf' version is just one of 12 that will be produced in this livery - and one of just 62 examples built in total.

It has debuted in California at the Quail Lodge show, which is part of Monterey Car Week in California.

The resurgent brand - which is being spearheaded by 2009 F1 champion Jenson Button, TV vehicle restorer Ant Anstead and designer Mark Stubbs - says it is now taking build slot applications for this ultra-exclusive model – and over half of the cars have already been allocated to owners.

Radford's return complete: The reborn coachbuilder has for the first time displayed its new Lotus Type 62-2 in the flesh, debuting the ultra-exclusive supercar at the Quail Lodge Show in California

The Gold Leaf Type 62-2 Quail Edition is the first of the bespoke models to be seen in the metal by members of the public.

It has a modern twist on the iconic Lotus Gold Leaf racing livery, which is one of the most famous and significant racing car colourways to grace Formula 1.

Its legendary red, white and gold colour scheme was applied after Colin Chapman signed a huge deal with Gold Leaf, and is most well-known on the Type 49B raced Graham Hill raced during the 1968 season. The colour scheme also featured on the famous Lotus 72 F1 car raced by Emerson Fittipaldi and Jochen Rindt in the 1970 season.

This special edition version stands apart from the other 12 Golf Leaf models due to its bespoke carbon fibre composite front splitter and rear diffuser, AP brake calipers and carbon ceramic brake rotors.

These are housed within larger 18-inch front and 19-inch rear Dymag carbon composite wheels, which are unique to the Quail Lodge example.

With a lower unsprung mass than the standard wheels, they should fractionally improve the nimble handling characteristics of the car, especially when wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres.

Speaking in the US today, its designer, Mark Stubbs, said: 'The Radford Type 62-2 in Gold Leaf guise, is a really special car. From a design perspective, the Gold Leaf car with these bespoke additions really stands out, with larger diffusers, and wheels. And sporting one of the most iconic racing liveries ever to grace a Formula 1 car, gives the car a real presence and sense of occasion.

'We’re only making 12 of these iconic cars, meaning they are already one of the rarest cars that money can buy. And most of them are already allocated to their owners.'

This special edition version stands apart from the other 12 Golf Leaf models due to its bespoke carbon fibre composite front splitter and rear diffuser, AP brake calipers and carbon ceramic brake rotors

Other features include a huge carbon-fibre rear diffuser and gold-tipped exhaust outlets. Radford says it has sold around half of the 62 models being produced

Radford is inspired by the legendary British coachbuilding company of the same name, which once built cars for a celebrity clientele that included all four of The Beatles.

Production of the Radford Type 62-2 begins in late 2021, with first deliveries being made in 2022.

While Radford says half are sold and it is taking applications for orders for the remaining models, it says it will not disclose a price due to the tailored nature of each vehicle for each customers, which ultimately determines how expensive individual cars will be.

The entry version is called the 'Classic' and will feature the Lotus V6 engine with 430bhp and a six-speed manual gearbox

What we already know about Radford's Lotus Type 62-2 road car

The supercar will be powered by a supercharged 3.5-litre V6 engine currently used in the Lotus Exige and will mark the first Radford coachbuilt creation for more than half a century.

An entry-level 'Classic' trim option comes with 430bhp and a six-speed manual gearbox.

It will be sold with forged alloy wheels - 17 inches up front and 18 inches at the rear - and use adjustable coilover suspension, Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres and AP racing brake calipers and iron discs.

There will also be a unique electronic stability programme to modulate power and grip designed by Bosch.

Radford's reimagined racer for the road: Just 12 of the 62 versions built will come in the iconic Lotus Gold Leaf racing livery

The mid-spec 'Gold Leaf' will have its six-cylinder engine upgraded to 500bhp with the addition of stronger con-rods, new pistons, more aggressive camshafts, a remapped ECU and a titanium exhaust system

The Gold Leaf Radford Type 62-2 will sport the iconic red-and-white livery of Graham Hill's 1968 Lotus Type 49B Formula One racer (pictured)

The 'Gold Leaf' - as seen at Quail Lodge, is the mid-tier model.

The six-cylinder engine will be upgraded to a more potent 500bhp output with the addition of stronger con-rods, new pistons, more aggressive camshafts, a remapped ECU and a titanium exhaust system.

Customers will get the option of a sharp-shifting seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox.

It also receives upgraded two-piece forged aluminium wheels that are an inch larger in diameter on each axle compared to those fitted to the Classic trim - though are still lighter.

A motorsport-derived traction control and ABS system - honed by Jenson Button - will also feature to control the extra engine performance.

Radford confirmed in July that it had purchased the rights to use the legendary John Player Special - or JPS - black and gold livery

The most powerful Type 62-2 is a 'JPS' version with 600bhp and the same stunning livery used on Emerson Fittipaldi's championship-winning Lotus-Ford 72D, pictured here during practice for the Grand Prix of Great Britain at Brands Hatch on 15 July 1972

Finally, the top grade examples will be the 'JPS' variants.

Having recently purchased the rights to use the legendary John Player Special black and gold livery, Radford will use the stunning scheme used on Emmerson Fittipaldi's 1972 championship-winning Lotus Type 72D F1 car for its most powerful 600bhp Type 62-2 with all the bells and whistles.

The unique thing about this engine is that we've kept it pure, no exhaust valves, no trickery of any kind – what you hear is uncorrupted and utterly authentic Jenson Button

While the top-spec gets the same chassis setup as the Gold Leaf version it has even lighter carbon composite wheels, monobloc calipers and carbon ceramic brake discs.

The team behind the limited-run car promise that the V6 engine will make a decent rumble, too.

'The sound of the Type 62-2 even at idle is something really special. But when you begin to explore the rev range further up, it becomes incredible, raising the hairs on the back of your neck and putting a big smile on your face,' Button says.

'However, the unique thing about this engine is that we've kept it pure, no exhaust valves, no trickery of any kind – what you hear is uncorrupted and utterly authentic – just like every single element of the driving experience.'

Underpinning each model will be a Lotus platform, with a modified version of the bonded aluminium chassis from the Elise and Exige sports cars.

Only 62 examples of the Type 62-2 will be created, with production due to start at the end of this year and first deliveries arriving in early 2022

The bodywork will be almost entirely carbon composite while the cabin will also be wrapped in a carbon fibre roll-over crash to provide occupant protection in the event of an accident

The bodywork will be almost entirely carbon composite while the cabin will also be wrapped in a carbon fibre roll-over crash to provide occupant protection in the event of an accident.

The combination of lightweight materials means the Type 62-2 should tip the scales at around 1,000kg - which is about the same as a Volkswagen Up! city car.

That means, in the most extreme JPS guise, the 600bhp-per-tonne ratio will be better than the V8 Mclaren 675 LT (564bhp per tonne), V12 Pagani Huayra Roadster (589bhp per tonne) and even the quad-turbo W16 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse (595bhp-per-tonne).

To improve both stiffness and how well it stick to the road in the bends, Radford will fit a bespoke - and sophisticated - tubular rear subframe that is promised to be a welded piece of art that's visible from the back of the car.

Like you'd find on most race cars, the underside of the new Type 62-2 is completely flat.

This is designed to channel air towards the rear diffuser to generate downforce at high speeds.

As a result, the Classic version does without a spoiler at all, while the Gold Leaf and JPS will have just a pair of small ducktails at each rear quarter. However, the JPS example will have a larger rear diffuser and front splitter to generate more load into the tarmac.

The Gold Leaf and JPS versions will both feature small ducktail tips on the rear quarters, which mimic those featured on the original Lotus car

Radford is best known for coachbuilt cars, especially bespoke Minis in the 1960s. Left: Britt Ekland received a one-off Radford Mini from her husband Peter Sellers for her birthday in 1965. Right: John Lennon pictured in his bespoke Radford Mini. One was built for each member of the band

Commenting on the project, Jenson Button explained: 'Creating a car that is simultaneously luxurious and comfortable, and great to drive, is a tough challenge, but the first Radford of the modern era delivers.

'Type 62-2 is a driver's car at its heart – when you see the design, it looks just like a 70s Le Mans car. And when you sit behind the steering wheel and look through the curved windscreen, you can see the front wheel arches – something you just don't experience on road cars today.

'With such a low centre of gravity, the car's body doesn't roll. The chassis exhibits all the hallmarks of a beautifully set up race car for the road – gifting the driver supreme confidence to extract maximum enjoyment every journey.'

Radford's design will remain true to the original Lotus's compact dimensions and will stand just 1,133mm tall - that's only fractionally higher than an original Ford GT40 and makes the Type 62-2 one of the shortest models on the market.

Stood alongside the car on which it's based, you might struggle to tell them apart at first glance - that includes the like-for-like doors, which will cut into the roof panel like a sixties endurance racer.

While this is a great period feature, it could cause problematic for taller drivers to get in and out. Jeremy Clarkson famously bought a modern-era GT40 in 2005 and struggled not only to get in but also to close the doors due to the lack of headroom.

Clarkson sold the car at the RM Sotheby's Monterey sale in 2017 for $379,500, having covered just 60 miles in the supercar.

The wing mirrors look like those on the original car but feature cameras mounted inside their housings that relay live images to the driver via small screens on each A-pillar so they can see what's going on around them

The Type 62-2 will stand just 1,133mm tall, making it one of the lowest cars to enter the market in recent history. The two doors will also have sections that cut into the roof panel, just like a sixties endurance racer

Jenson Button is not only one of the owners of the revitalised Radford brand but also in charge of making sure the bespoke supercars offer the best driving experience

Modern upgrades include LED headlights - which have been designed to look like the original lamps - and a connecting LED bar between the two brake light clusters.

It also gets wing mirrors that are similar in shape to those on the original car but feature cameras mounted inside their housings that relay live images to the driver via small screens on each A-pillar so they can see what's going on around them.

Inside, Radford promises creature comforts including a five-speaker stereo, digital rear-view camera and six-inch digital instrument cluster.

For those customers intending to take their Lotus remake back to the track, there's a built in data logger and configurable displays the simplify the digital instrument cluster to show speed, gear selection and lap times for when they're hurtling around a circuit.

Left to right: Mark Stubbs, Ant Anstead, Jenson Button

Each version will also be sold with an optional power nose lift system, which raised the front of the car so it can clear speed bumps and difficult angles for car parks and sloped driveways.

Customers will also get the opportunity to increase the bespoke purchase price with the addition of matching custom luggage from Mason and Sons, which slots under the front clamshell.

The returning car brand says buyers will work closely with its design team to select every element of their bespoke vehicle, from the upholstery finishes, paint colours and aero features on the bodywork.

It's for this reason it says it can't make the price of the cars publicly known.

Stubbs said: 'Coachbuilding in the modern era utterly liberates an automotive designer. Advances in technology have ushered in a new era of this historic craft, making it possible to achieve levels of quality and design never before possible and deliver them in an extremely short time.

'This enables us to evoke the spirit of an iconic car with stunning authenticity and offer owners the ultimate in customisation. However, while Type 62-2 elicits the original Type 62 Lotus hallmarks, it sets its own path as a Radford model – it's all about creating a feeling of driving something timeless. Something that doesn't look or feel like anything else on the road.'

Production of the Radford Type 62-2 begins in late 2021, with first deliveries being made in the first quarter of 2022.

Anstead added: 'Only 62 Radford Type 62 models will ever be built. No two will be exactly alike, and each will be an exceptionally rare sight on the world's roads.'

They predict another decade of solid investment returns from Indian equities – on the back of a booming economy, a young workforce and greater international investment in the country (in part triggered by big multinational businesses wishing to reduce their dependency on an increasingly belligerent China).

Brian Dennehy, managing director of investment scrutineer FundExpert, has been recommending India to clients since 2008.

Indeed, the stock market remains his top investment recommendation for the coming decade.

He says: 'A young population and a reform minded government headed by Narendra Modi can power the Indian economy for many years and decades to come.'

The latest global economic outlook report from the International Monetary Fund backs Dennehy's view. It believes India will lead the world's economic recovery this year and next.

Although the Indian economy shrank last year by more than five per cent as a result of the pandemic, the IMF says it is on course to rebound strongly – growing by 9.5 per cent this year and 8.5 per cent in 2022.

No other economy, it forecasts, will grow by as much – not even China where the IMF says the respective growth figures will be 8.1 per cent and 5.7 per cent.

David Cornell is chief investment officer of London based Ocean Dial Asset Management which runs India Capital Growth, a £127million trust listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Over the past ten years, the fund has generated shareholder returns of 151 per cent from a portfolio of between 30 and 35 stocks.

He describes India as a 'compelling investment story' as a result of a number of inter-connected factors – none more important than prime minister Modi's determination to free up the economy.

Modi, says Cornell, is leading the way, driving through a series of reforms aimed at removing the bureaucracy which previously inhibited many businesses and discouraged competition.

The PM has also simplified and reduced business taxes while signalling a big increase in infrastructure spending.

The economy, he adds, will also get a boost from the trend which has seen a shift of manufacturing from China to India. 'Foreign investment in India is increasing all the time,' he says.

'Mobile phone giant Apple has said it plans to shift a fifth of its production capacity from China to India.

'Similarly, Samsung is looking to expand its operations at its Noida factory in Uttar Pradesh. Amazon and packaging company Procon Packaging are also investing in India.'

As well as concerns over China's geo-political intentions, low wage costs – a third of those in China – are helping drive this investment in India.

It's a point made by Ramesh Mantri, senior analyst at White Oak Capital Management, a boutique investment house specialising in Indian equities and manager of fund Ashoka India Equity.

He says: 'Anti Chinese sentiment is spreading across Asia and the world is waking up to the fact that it is too reliant on China as a manufacturer of goods. It now sees India as a perfect alternative, a large country with a low cost labour force.'

The composition of India's economy is slowly changing, moving from its dependency on industries such as oil and gas, coal and commodities to embrace new technology – a shift given impetus by the pandemic and the need for the country to digitalise. This is seen as a positive for the equity market.

'India doesn't have well-established, stock market listed technology companies to match those in China such as Tencent and Alibaba,' says Cornell. 'But a new economy is slowly emerging.'

He points to last month's listing of food delivery company Zomato as evidence of investor appetite for technology focused businesses.

A wave of other private companies with a digital bent, among them logistics company Delhivery and online eyewear business Lenskart, are also looking to go public.

A young population – 50 per cent of India's 1.3billion people are aged under 25 – with money to spend will help spur economic growth.

Dzmitry Lipski, head of fund research at wealth manager Interactive Investor, believes the country's young and well educated population is its 'biggest asset'.

He adds: 'India's middle class is expected to grow from around 50million today to 475 million by 2030.

As they move to the cities, their lifestyles will evolve and their aspirations will grow, This in turn will drive consumer spending and generate economic growth.'

Mantri believes the Indian equity market is a dream for stock-picking fund managers.

This is because of its size – there are more than 5,000 listed companies – the diversity of its constituents, and the fact that some companies are poorly researched.

This provides the opportunity to unearth companies that are seriously undervalued. The fund's 65- strong portfolio is correspondingly skewed towards small and mid cap companies where share price inefficiencies are more prevalent.

Over the past three years, the investment trust has generated a return of 66 per cent.

With India's BSE Sensex stock market having enjoyed a good past year (up more than 50 per cent), it could be argued that a lot of good news is already priced into share prices.

It's a point Ocean Dial's Cornell concedes. 'Yes, the market has priced in a sustained economy recovery – and of course that could be stalled if Covid returns with a vengeance,' he says.

'But if you are prepared to take a five to seven-year investment view, and are happy to endure a few bumps along the way, India could be the place to invest a slice of your investment portfolio.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Will Informa be the first FTSE100-listed company of the year to be targeted by a private equity giant? Or is an industry rival preparing a swoop on the publishing and events company?

Those are the questions investors are asking themselves as rumours whip around the Square Mile about a possible takeover of Informa, the publisher of titles including Lloyd's List.

In 2008, several private equity firms including Providence and Carlyle came together to attempt a buyout of Informa, but the deal collapsed amid the fallout from the financial crisis.

Uncertain future: Will Informa be the first FTSE100-listed company of the year to be targeted by a private equity giant?

Since then, Informa has grown substantially. It merged with rival UBM in 2018 to create Britain's biggest events and publishing firm.

However, just last year Informa was forced to go cap in hand to shareholders via a £1billion rights issue amid fears for its financial prospects.

Now, however, the talk in the market is that a mystery predator is working with banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup on a blockbuster £10 billion-plus takeover bid.

Mast Energy secures backing from major player?

Among the small caps, Mast Energy Developments – a tiny reserve power plant specialist – has come into focus amid talk it has secured financial backing from a major industry player.

Word is a 'strategic business' is prepared to lend Mast around £10 million to help the company fund its growth.

Mast said recently it had bought a gas-powered generation plant in Derbyshire called Pyebridge Power for £2.5million.

That will take it nine megawatts closer to the 300 megawatts it hopes one day to be generating.

Buzz around Yourgene Health

There is a bit of a buzz around Yourgene Health, a molecular diagnostics company.

Last week the business, which is chaired by serial small investor Adam Reynolds, unveiled final results showing first quarter revenue had risen by 80 per cent to £6million.

And City gossips claim Yourgene Health could soon see further substantial revenue growth as the company is set to win further major contracts.

Market practitioners expect a series of broker upgrades if those new contracts come good.

Rare earth minerals firm Pensana set for loans

With the environment at the top of the political agenda it may not be a surprise to hear that the Government could be about to give the green light to a set of multi-million pound loans to Pensana, a London-listed rare earth minerals firm.

In March, the company said it would receive money from the Government's £1billion Automotive Transformation Fund. City sources said more detail is about to emerge about the loan.

Earlier this year it emerged that Pensana was looking to develop Western Europe's first rare earth processing plant, a £90 million separation facility in Hull.

The aim is to produce a sustainable supply of rare earth oxides, used in offshore wind turbines and electric vehicles.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@British defence companies Ultra Electronics and Meggitt have moved a step closer to delist from the FTSE 250 and fall into foreign hands today.

Ultra, which supplies cutting-edge submarine-hunting technology to the Royal Navy, is being taken over by US-owned Cobham, which said it has agreed to a £2.57billion deal to buy the London-listed firm.

Meanwhile, Coventry-based Meggitt, which makes parts for planes and military aircraft including 'black boxes' for the RAF's Typhoon jets, reconfirmed its plans to accept a £6.3billion bid from US business Parker-Hannifin.

British defence sell-off: Ultra Electronics and Meggitt are set to be taken over by US firms

It also said the stock market's Takeover Panel will set a deadline on another rival bidder, TransDigm to make its own £7billion bid binding.

Transdigm had proposed buying Meggitt for 900p per share, which outweighs the 800p bid from Parker Hannifin. Shares in Meggitt were down 0.2 per cent to 817p just after London stock market close on Monday.

Meggitt shareholders will be asked to vote on Parker Hannifin proposed takeover on September 17 but this could be delayed if TransDigm makes its own bid binding.

This wave of bids for key UK defence assets has seen the Government coming under pressure to step in to block the deals on national security grounds.

Only last week, another key defence business was sold off as Babcock International offloaded its Frazer-Nash Consultancy that does work on nuclear submarines and weaponry for Royal Navy warships to American aerospace group KBR for nearly £300million.

Cobham, which is owned by US private equity firm Advent, said it recognised 'the specific importance of Ultra's contribution to the UK's economy and national security'.

And it pledged to engage with the UK government to agree the detailed terms, duration, nature and form of its binding commitments, which would apply immediately after the closing of the deal to protect Ultra's businesses and stakeholders.

Cobham added it would protect existing jobs and invest in research and development to create new ones in UK manufacturing and engineering positions.

London-based Ultra would also keep its headquarters in the UK, it added, and the Government will have an 'ongoing dialogue, co-operation and monitoring' position to ensure the commitments are upheld.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is said to have ordered officials to launch a national security investigation under the Enterprise Act.

The Act gives the Government the power to intervene in mergers on public interest grounds covering national security.

Ultra-Cobham deal: Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is said to have ordered officials to launch a national security investigation under the Enterprise Act

Shareholders in Ultra will get £35 a share and a 16.2p-a-share dividend under the deal, which was first announced in late July.

Ultra shares were up 4.8 per cent to £33.12 just after London stock market close on Monday.

The board will now ask shareholders to vote on the deal and must secure the support of 75 per cent.

Shonnel Malani, chairman of the Cobham Group, said: 'We believe Cobham and Ultra's complementary capabilities delivering mission critical technology will be significantly enhanced through the combination of the two groups, enabling the development of higher performance solutions for our customers.'

He added: 'We look forward to working with HM Government, and other relevant stakeholders, to agree legally binding commitments which safeguard Ultra's contribution to the UK economy and national security.'

Tony Rice, chairman of Ultra, said: 'The Ultra board has... spent considerable time reviewing the potential impact of Cobham's ownership on Ultra's stakeholders and is comfortable that their stakeholder commitments plus legally binding undertakings to HM Government will protect stakeholder interests appropriately.

'The Ultra board therefore unanimously intends to recommend the Cobham offer to shareholders.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I havea confession to make – please don't hold it against me. I love some of the BBC's current output on Radio Four and television.

I can't get enough of The Archers (I hope alcoholic Alice Carter hasn't done anything silly after going awol), love Celebrity MasterChef (isn't Su Pollard delightfully quirky), and found the second series of crime drama Baptiste utterly absorbing (Fiona Shaw is yet again a revelation).

Yet it doesn't mean I am happy with all things BBC. Far from it. Some of its new 'comedy' programmes on Radio Four make for uncomfortable listening, are not fit for purpose, and frankly should not be aired.

Sign of the times: There is an air of arrogance within the BBC – plus a worrying overload of wokeism

And although I am a long-time listener of the Today programme, its continued aggressive interviewing of guests has made me question whether my regular early morning dalliance with it should be suspended indefinitely.

There is also an air of arrogance within the BBC – plus a worrying overload of wokeism – that I find appalling.

It seems I am not alone in my criticisms. Here, at The Mail on Sunday, we pride ourselves on providing a mouthpiece for readers who are outraged about the actions of a particular company or organisation – or, for that matter, regulator or Government.

Occasionally, we receive a torrent of emails and letters so overwhelming that we have a duty to take heed.

As my colleague Toby Walne reports, such a situation has now arisen with the BBC.

In a nutshell, readers are outraged about the tactics TV Licensing – the payment collection arm of the BBC – is employing to ensure that pensioners over the age of 75 now pay for a TV licence.

This follows the Corporation's controversial decision last August to scrap free licences for four million pensioners aged over 75 (those on low incomes will still no longer have to pay provided they are in receipt of Pension Credit).

Having encouraged pensioners to pay up with gentle reminders, TV Licensing is now ramping up the pressure on the remaining 260,000.

These tactics are unacceptable. It has sent out some letters warning pensioners that they will be visited by an enforcement officer if they do not play ball. 'Our officers visit an address every six seconds. Day. Evening. Even weekends. And if no one answers, they can come back,' the letters say.

It is Orwellian behaviour.

Of course, the BBC was wrong to have removed the right of a free licence for all pensioners over the age of 75.

Although that wrong cannot now be righted, it doesn't mean that the voices of those pensioners who are angry about the BBC's move should not be heard.

Hence our decision to give them a platform to air their opinions, today and last week.

We would also never recommend that readers should refuse to pay for a TV licence because ultimately they will be taken to court and could end up in prison.

But, again, we will report the views of those who remain determined not to pay – and expose the unacceptable tactics the BBC is using via TV Licensing to intimidate them into paying.

You would have thought that a BBC whose motto is 'nation shall speak peace unto nation' would understand this.

But it doesn't. Instead of listening to those who feel aggrieved about the loss of their free TV licence – and accepting that the use of payment enforcement officers is a step too far – it has spent the past seven days in self-denial.

It has attempted to persuade the MoS that its enforcement officers are not being sent out to 'enforce' payment, but to provide some form of customer care. Baloney.

For those pensioners who feel aggrieved over the loss of their free TV licence, they should look at their humble goggle-box sitting in the corner of their living room and ask themselves two simple questions.

One: 'Do I still really need to watch the BBC and live TV on other channels?'

Two: 'Can I live without BBC's online iPlayer service?'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What happens when you're stuck in a five-mile tailback in an electric car with less than a full battery charge?

It's a question consumer watchdog Which? has attempted to answer after it had received messages from its members concerned an EV's battery will be sapped if a driver is using the air-con, heated seats and other features in a traffic jam.

It found that over an hour at a standstill with the lights on, modulating the cabin temperature, streaming music and playing videos through screens in the back had only a small impact on energy usage - losing just 2 per cent capacity, or eight miles of range.

However, it warned the test was conducted in the summer and suggested the capacity could deplete quicker in colder conditions and batteries don't perform at their optimum level.

EV myth busting! Will an electric vehicle's battery drain when stuck in traffic and you want to use features such as air-con and heated-seats? A consumer watchdog has simulated being stuck in a tailback in a plug-in model to find out

'Electric cars are still relatively new and there is a lot of misinformation out there about battery range, including dystopian style warnings of dormant electric cars strewn across our roads because the air-con (or lights, or similar) drained the battery in a traffic jam,' Which? explained.

To attempt to disprove the myth, it simulated a traffic jam scenario in the latest Volkswagen ID.4 electric SUV.

To understand how battery capacity was impacted by the vehicle being stationary, the test was conducted with music being streamed through the Android Auto system built into the infotainment system.

Both front heated seats were also turned up to the highest temperature setting, the air-con at full blast, dipped headlights on (not on automatic, but manually on) and a tablet plugged into a USB socket playing a film in the back seats.

After just over an hour and 15 minutes the VW's battery lost just 2 per cent of of its 77kWh capacity - the equivalent of only eight miles in range.

We’ll return to this subject in winter, when the temperature starts dropping, to look at what happens Which? UK research team

'In short, a very small amount of the electric car’s battery was used to keep the car comfortable,' the study revealed.

However, Which? did point out that its controlled test was conducted on a summer’s day and warned that cold weather will have more of an affect on the car’s power usage.

'We’ll return to this subject in winter, when the temperature starts dropping, to look at what happens,' it promised.

After just over an hour and 15 minutes the VW's battery lost just 2% of of its 77kWh capacity - the equivalent of only eight miles in range

While Which? said the mini test had proved a point, it warned that in colder conditions the impact on the batteries is likely to be bigger

Commenting on the test results, Lisa Barber, Which?'s products and services Editor, said: 'There is a lot of misinformation out there about electric vehicles, including whether you are likely to run out of juice when stuck in a traffic jam.

'However, our research has shown that electric vehicles can preserve their battery power well, even if they are stuck in traffic with the music, air-con and headlights on.

'We know consumers are open to switching to electric vehicles, however there are several barriers to ownership that must be addressed including perceived performance, the high upfront cost of a new electric vehicle and the UK's fragmented public charging network, which needs to be overhauled to ensure it is fit-for-purpose.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Insurance group Admiral saw its earnings surge by 76 per cent in the first six months of this year, fresh figures have revealed.

In a boost for the group's shareholders, Admiral has also announced it will be dishing out a special dividend later this year.

The company grew its customer base by 850,000 in the period, taking its overall customer numbers to 8.02million.

Surge: Insurance group Admiral saw its earnings surge by 76% in the first six months of 2021

Admiral saw its profits come in at £482.2million in the first half, more than previous forecasts of between £400million and £450million.

The insurer has set its dividend at 115p a share, as the company sweetened a half year dividend of 87.9p with a special dividend of 27.1p, propelling its shares to new highs of around £35.36. Shareholders will receive their dividend payouts on 1 October.

Milena Mondini de Focatiis, the group's chief executive, said: 'A good strategy is a plus; good execution is a must, especially in times of disruption. It’s been a half year of good execution for Admiral. By and large, we’ve done the right things more often and a bit earlier than most.'

She added: 'This included adjusting pricing ahead of the market in the UK to reflect shifting pandemic-related claims trends and providing more self-service and digital options to our customers. These actions have rewarded us with double digit growth in policy numbers in the UK and in international insurance, whilst operating in very competitive markets.'

The group has benefited from lower levels of motor insurance claims during the pandemic, even after most lockdown restrictions were eased in the last few weeks.

In charge: Admiral's boss, Milena Mondini de Focatiis

Admiral said: 'In most markets, whilst road traffic levels have started to return towards more normal levels, this has been slower than expected as lockdown restrictions have persisted longer, resulting in continued lower claims frequency relative to pre-pandemic levels.

'The UK, in particular, saw a longer than expected lockdown in the first half of 2021, with claims frequency taking longer to recover. In contrast, the US has seen a more rapid return towards more normal levels.'

The group announced today that around 10,000 staff will each receive an award worth up to £1,800 based on the company's employee share scheme.

Ms Mondini de Focatiis said: 'I am delighted that we can once again pay a record dividend to our shareholders, including our staff who continued to work hard to provide great service to our customers. I would also like to thank all of our customers for their continued trust in us.'

Shares in FTSE 100-listed Admiral are up 1.54 per cent or 53.00p to 3,502.00p. A year ago the group's share price was 2,525.00p.

Danni Hewson, an analyst at AJ Bell, said Admiral's latest results made the group akin to 'the Rolls Royce of motor insurers.'

She added: 'Compared with its peers the growth in profit and customer numbers the company is chalking up is highly impressive.

'While the industry as a whole benefited from a period with fewer cars on the road, leading to fewer accidents and, in turn, fewer claims, Admiral seems to have managed the situation better than its rival insurers.

'Admiral has won over customers by offering flexibility, boosting its digital capability and paying out customer rebates in a timely fashion, helping to put it ahead of the pack in a highly competitive market.

'These qualities have been rewarded with a double-digit increase in customer numbers at a time when other UK motor insurers are struggling to eke out any growth here at all.

'Shareholders are being richly rewarded with record dividend payments and Admiral’s strong financial position gives it lots of options while it works out what route it wants to take next.

'The road ahead could be a little bumpier for Admiral as the artificially lower levels of traffic and collisions driven by Covid restrictions starts to unwind, however the company has clearly demonstrated its ability to steer the right course.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investing allows you to put your money to work to earn better returns, but when is a good time to start?

Studies have shown that many people who don’t invest believe that investing isn’t for people like them. However, if you are will to take some risk, once you have a rainy day fund safely saved in cash, investing over the long-term represents your best chance of inflation-beating returns that will make you richer.

So, how do you get started? You need to consider your goals, how long you plan to invest for and how much risk you are willing to take.

There is less than a month to go until the US election and under normal circumstances you would expect all the focus of stock market commentators to be on that.

It’s not normal circumstances though. The second wave of coronavirus and renewed lockdowns have the world’s attention and the election, if not a sideshow, is definitely not as centre stage as we would usually expect.

Does that mean it doesn’t matter for investors, or should be thinking about it and positioning themselves for the outcome?

Does it even matter if Trump or Biden wins, as long as the Fed keeps printing and stimulus keeps coming, and would any decisive win be better than a disputed result?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert, Georgie Frost and Sarah Davidson, discuss the US election and what it could mean for our money over here in the UK.

But how do you know when the time is right to start? What are the things to consider when working out what investments might suit you? And do you need to wait until you are wealthy before you become an investor?

In this first of two special This is Money podcasts, Simon Lambert is joined by Rob Morgan, of Charles Stanley Direct, to help listeners through the investing maze and give them an easy to understand guide to getting started investing

The most recent edition of the longstanding Barclays Equity Gilt report showed that investing in the UK stock market has delivered an average annual above inflation return of 5.3 per cent over the past 50 years, whereas cash has returned 1 per cent.

But investing is not without its risks.

You must be prepared to potentially lose money and may need to ride out market crashes, as we have seen in the coronavirus crisis.

However, another thing that the crisis has thrown up is more people saving money, as they cut back on spending. A This is Money poll showed 71 per cent of readers said that lockdown had left them with more spare money to save.

So, if you have a rainy day pot of cash stashed away and want to start investing the money you have beyond that, where do you get started?

People collectively tucked away £30billion in savings accounts in March and April, around three times as much as the two months previous - with this credited to surplus cash and moving money to safety.

A large slab of that went into easy-access accounts despite plunging rates. Meanwhile, we cleared a record amount of personal debt, according to Bank of England figures.

The ONS says households are spending £182 less a week, but while some might be lucky to salt that away, many wouldn't come anywhere near it.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Few car firms have had a bigger impact than Elon Musk's Tesla. And with mainstream motor manufacturers now producing some decent electric car competition, there can be no denying the Californian company has shaken up the market.

I have just picked up the 'affordable' and attainable Tesla — a Model 3 Dual Motor Long Range All-Wheel Drive with a base price of £48,490, but costing £49,990 after the addition of £1,500 19in sports wheels.

Customer service was faultless — from the setting up of the drive to the hand-over. I was also sent some 'how to' video links to familiarise myself with the controls.

A delight to drive: Tesla's powerful Model 3 Dual Motor Long Range

The minimalist interior has no traditional dashboard and only a smart-pad-like screen in the middle of the dash. It is through this the car's functions are conducted.

Doing things differently and re-imagining the art of driving is all very well – but if you've spent decades mastering the 'traditional' car set-up you'll need time and patience to adapt. It's like mastering an Apple Mac after a lifetime on Windows PCs.

I know owners who are in seventh heaven with their Teslas – once they get totally familiar with it.

Its 82kWh battery promises a range of 360 miles. But part of Tesla's genius has been to set up a network of more than 750 superchargers in 84 locations across the UK.

I found the Model 3 a delight to drive with great presence and precise handling. And boy does it shift. My family saloon could accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 4.2 seconds, up to a top speed of 145mph.

The more powerful Performance AWD model (priced from £59,990) will cover 0-60mph in 3.1 seconds up to a top speed of 162mph and a range of 352 miles.

The entry level Standard Range Plus rear-wheel drive costs from £40,990 and covers 0-60mph in 5.3 seconds up to a top speed of 140mph with a range of 278 miles.

I tried 'Autopilot' mode — my hands lightly on the steering wheel as the car cornered by itself. But I'm not sure I'd let go at speed.

Will it fit in my garage?

Supercharger: Around 172 miles range in 15 minutes.

There was plenty of room for passengers in the back, plus storage in the front trunk.

However, the smart screen settings can be a faff. Yes, they're explained in the 'how to' videos. But you can't watch them when you're in traffic.

Plus the Tesla voice control responds only to U.S. English — they're still working on 'British English'.

On a motorway during a monsoon downpour I wanted to increase the speed of the windscreen wipers. Look left to the screen, search for icon, press icon, adjust setting On a motorway?

Forget it. Too distracting in the deluge. I thought I'd be clever and try voice control. I press the voice command button on the steering wheel and say: 'Wipers fast'. It switched the wipers off altogether.

Thankfully, pressing the one-wipe button on the left stalk kept it going long enough for me to pull in and sort safely (it also causes the wiper-adjust icon to pop up on the screen I belatedly discovered). But it was hairy.

My biggest criticism is the absence of a head-up display, which would overcome the distraction.

Despite the glitches, I really enjoyed the experience and would like to spend longer with a Tesla in the future.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It's natural to look at some of the big challenges in our society and want to help out.

Of course, this can be done by volunteering or giving to charity, but there is also another option: investing in social projects.

There is a rising number of investment opportunities to both help out and make a decent investment return. For example, investors can put their money into affordable housing, good healthcare and sustainable food projects.

As always, it's important that investors never put all their eggs in one basket, so social projects should form only a component of a balanced portfolio.

Helping hand: It's natural to look at some of the big challenges in our society and want to help

However, investments in social projects can make a good portfolio diversifier as their shares tend not to rise and fall in line with stock market volatility.

Investors can access social projects through funds and stock market-listed investment trusts.

By holding these funds in an Isa, they can protect their investments from tax. Alternatively, they can invest through an innovative finance Isa.

Investing via funds and investment trusts

There is a limited number of funds and investment trusts that specialise in social projects, although there are likely to be further launches in the future.

One such fund is Schroder BSC Social Impact, an investment trust launched in December last year by investment manager Schroders and social investment institution Big Society Capital.

The £77million trust invests in projects that aim to tackle homelessness, provide support for people with learning disabilities, offer housing for domestic abuse survivors, and address other pressing social challenges.

For example, it recently invested in the Stronger Families programme. This supports young people and families in Norfolk by improving communication between them and thereby enabling young people to stay with their families rather than go into care.

If a young person does not go into care because the programme has been successful, it receives a payment from the council to reflect their improved life chances and reduced care costs.

James Lowe, investment trust business development manager at Schroders, says: 'The trust aims to make a return of two per cent above inflation. It is not just about making a profit – the social impact it brings about is just as important.'

Laith Khalaf is a financial analyst at investment platform AJ Bell. He believes the Schroder trust is innovative, but warns that as it is so new it lacks a credible performance record.

He says the investment trust structure is well suited to this type of investment.

This is because investment trusts are closed-ended, which means that investors can withdraw their money at any time without forcing the fund managers to sell any underlying assets, which may not be easy to do without plenty of notice.

Shares in the trust can be bought at £1.05, although the fact that they stand at a premium to the fund's underlying assets may deter some investors.

Khalaf says that anyone who want a more diversified fund that invests in listed companies providing a positive environmental and social impact might consider Liontrust Sustainable Future Global Growth.

There is a number of investment opportunities to help out & make a decent investment return

This has turned a £1,000 investment into £1,757 over three years and invests in well-run companies around the world whose products are shaping the global economy of the future.

Some property investment trusts also specialise in providing social housing and buildings for essential services.

Susannah Streeter is senior investment and markets analyst at wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown.

She likes Civitas Social Housing, which provides supported living accommodation for tenants with learning disabilities and mental health needs.

'The investments are mainly based on long-term leases with registered providers, so they should provide a stable rental return,' she says.

'There is also likely to be strong demand for the accommodation the trust invests in, given the lack of specialist housing to meet the needs of potential residents. The company has already developed a pipeline of potential acquisitions.'

The trust has turned a £1,000 investment into £1,328 over three years and last week announced a quarterly dividend of 1.3875 pence a share. It also claims it has created 'social value' of £127million in the year to April, through direct cost savings to the public purse and improved wellbeing for its residents.

Streeter also likes Primary Health Properties. This trust invests in community healthcare facilities, earning an income from the leases it negotiates with the tenants (usually Government-backed).

Other trusts with a social impact thrust include Target Healthcare and Triple Point Social Housing.

Investors can access social projects through funds and stock market-listed investment trusts

Investing through an Innovative Finance Isa

The innovative finance Isa is the lesser-known cousin of the stocks and shares Isa and cash Isa. It too is a tax-free wrapper and all UK taxpayers are entitled to put up to £20,000 – their full Isa allowance – into one every tax year.

A number of social projects are available to invest in through an innovative finance Isa.

For example, through its innovative finance Isa, the ethical bank Triodos offers access to a range of social impact investments.

It recently raised £1.5million to support Paces Sheffield, a leading charity for people with cerebral palsy and other neurological motor disorders.

The eight-year bond offered pays six per cent interest per year, with a minimum investment of £50.

Other recent investments include helping the YMCA to develop a community and activity village in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire – and helping charity Thera Trust to provide homes for people with learning disabilities.

Returns are not guaranteed and there is no protection for investors if something goes wrong. It is also not always possible to get money out early, so investors need to be able to invest for the long term.

Abundance Investment also offers access to social projects through an innovative finance Isa.

It has just launched an investment in Sterling Suffolk, a commercial tomato grower which is reducing the environmental cost of growing tomatoes in the UK with cutting-edge glasshouse technology.

Investors will earn eight per cent per year over the bond's 11-year term, although the return is not guaranteed.

Britons consume more than 500,000 tons of fresh tomatoes each year, but four fifths are imported, leading to a high environmental cost.

Bruce Davis, co-founder and managing director of Abundance Investment, says: 'Finding scalable ways to cut the environmental cost of the foods we eat has to be a priority if we want to feed ourselves more sustainably in the transition to a net zero economy.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The 'granny' annexe has deep roots, but now it's annexes of all kinds that are in high demand.

Councils received around 9,000 planning applications for them in 2019/20 — that's 25 a day, according to Churchill Home Insurance.

Around a fifth of these are to convert existing outbuildings like a garage or a shed. But the large majority are for completely new premises in the garden — for childcare, home schooling, office space and shielding, which were cited among the biggest reasons.

A bit on the side: Converting an unused shed could add £91,000 to the value of your home

There's a cash bonus to this. Churchill claims annexes add an average £91,000 to the value of a home and make it a far better proposition when it comes to selling.

'Any property with a purpose-built office or studio gains more interest from purchasers.

It is also a common request from buyers on their wants-list,' says Giles Davidson of Hamptons estate agency.

So how do you go about joining Britain's annexe army? Firstly, decide on size and purpose. If it's serving a single function — like a games space or a home office — it need only be a large room, perhaps with a loo and basic kitchenette.

If it's for use as a home gym it may require stronger floors and walls; and if it's for something like recording music (or playing music in the case of teenagers) consider the best soundproofing you can afford.

By contrast, if the annexe is to host people overnight — whether friends or Airbnb or holiday let guests — most annexes would have at least one bedroom and en suite bathroom, a living space and a modest kitchen.

Large purpose-built annexes are likely to require a full planning application

Secondly, choose whether you buy a kit or get a one-off purpose-built annexe.

Some companies offer flat packs: prices vary according to size and materials, with basic costs topped up by add-ons such as toilets, showers, air conditioning and extra windows. If you're going for a purpose-built annexe, hire an architect or specialised company and expect to pay more.

Thirdly, submit a planning application — if required. It's likely that a simple conversion of a garage or an existing garden house into living quarters may not need planning consent, but larger purpose-built annexes are likely to require a full application. These should take no more than eight weeks to be agreed or rejected.

The Government has relaxed so-called permitted development rules but there are strict limits on height, size and uses for annexes, plus extra controls if the main house is listed or in a conservation area. Check planningportal.co.uk.

Finally, treat the finished annexe as part of the house for insurance purposes.

'Anyone considering constructing or converting a garden annexe needs to inform their insurer that work is taking place and consider the additional building and contents on their policy once it's complete,' says Pritpal Powar of Churchill.

Such is the growing popularity of annexes that many estate agents suggest sellers with sufficiently large gardens or land secure planning permission for one ahead of putting the property on the market — even if they don't build it.

For the buyer, this consent gives a signal that they can build an annexe if they wish, including an idea of size and position. Consent also adds to the value of the property, so both sides of the deal gain.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As the Tokyo Olympic Games enters its final days, China leads the medals table - with Team GB in sixth place. But what would the table look like if countries were assessed on their stockmarket performance?

Some 70 countries have mature stock exchanges, with 16 having a market cap of more than $1trillion. Markets often vary depending on what’s happening in their host country. Last month, for example, saw Chinese shares drop after Beijing signalled a tougher approach to tech and education firms.

Investment bank MSCI (formerly Morgan Stanley) produces comparative data on stock-market performance, and if judged on the past five years, Taiwan - famed for its high-tech economy — comes out on top with a 270 per cent return. Yet the country’s stock-market is seen as an emerging market - a riskier bet.

Investment bank MSCI gives comparative data on stock-market performance. If judged on the past five years, Taiwan comes out on top with a 270% return

The silver medal goes to the Netherlands, whose MSCI index shows an impressive 239 per cent return since 2016. The Dutch stock exchange is deemed a developed market - meaning its considered more suitable for retail investors.

The Gulf state of Kuwait - another emerging market - takes bronze with a return of 228 per cent. Hot on its heels is the U.S. with a 220 per cent return since 2016. Saudi Arabia is next with a 209 per cent return. It’s a disappointing finish for Team GB: 25th place amongst developed and emerging markets.

But it isn’t all bad: the UK market delivered a 128 per cent return. Olympics medal table-leader China finishes 12th, with a 179 per cent return. But what does it mean for investors? First off, a stock-market doesn’t always reflect a country’s wider performance, it’s a measure of the companies listed there. The UK’s FTSE, for example, has been skewed by multinationals such as Shell.

These companies produce billions, but their shares aren’t dynamic. Smaller markets can also be distorted by a few super-performers. It’s telling that both Taiwan and the Netherlands host companies making semiconductors. These materials power smartphones and have seen a surge in demand.

The stock-market Olympics isn’t perfect, but it reminds us why we need a diverse portfolio

Shares in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) are up 235 per cent since 2016, while Dutch producer ASML is up 607 per cent. TSMC was a top ten holding for the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust — until Baillie Gifford reduced its stake in January. The firm makes up 40 per cent of Taiwan’s MSCI Index.

The stock-market Olympics isn’t perfect, but it reminds us why we need a diverse portfolio. Buying foreign shares directly can be complicated. Instead, most investors use funds to get their exposure to foreign markets.

As these funds are UK-registered, they are easier to buy — and can be put in a stocks and shares Isa. Active funds are run by professional stock-pickers who aim to pick companies that can beat the relevant MSCI benchmark. For larger markets, there are
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Carl Cavers started video games group Sumo in 2003, a friend lent him somewhere to work free of charge because he and his three co-founders could not afford to pay any rent.

None of them took a salary and early employees accepted peppercorn wages, in the hope that they could work together and build up a meaningful business.

Those hopes proved well-placed. Last week, Cavers recommended a £5.13 a share bid from Chinese tech giant Tencent, valuing Sumo at £919million.

In the bag?: Sumo, which developed Sackboy: A Big Adventure, is set to be bought by Chinese firm Tencent

Sheffield-based Sumo has clearly come a long way in the past 18 years. The group is one of the best-known games developers in the world, counting giants such as Microsoft, Sony and Apple as customers.

Now employing 1,200 staff, Sumo designs, builds and tests games, as well as providing customer support post-launch. Top games include Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Team Sonic Racing, and Sumo has started to publish its own titles too, including Spyder and Snake Pass.

Publishing is higher risk but higher reward and Tencent clearly believes that Cavers and his team have what it takes. The Chinese group bought 15million shares in Sumo back in November 2019 and has been watching developments ever since.

Armed with its holding, equivalent to 8.75 per cent of the company, Tencent pounced on Tuesday last week. The offer was 43 per cent higher than Sumo's share price the day before the bid was made and several big investors have already agreed to the offer, so the Chinese now have more than 33 per cent of Sumo's shares in the bag.

Nonetheless, there is debate about the deal. Sumo will be the second UK video group to fall prey to a foreign predator, after another Midas tip, Codemasters, was snapped up by US rival Electronic Arts earlier this year. And Shenzen-based Tencent, which is listed in Hong Kong, could be vulnerable to the whims of Xi Jinping, China's autocratic president.

This has prompted calls for Tencent's bid to come under further scrutiny from the UK Government and regulators. As of yet, there is no hint of concern from the authorities.

But individual Sumo shareholders may legitimately wonder what they should do, as the Tencent bid goes through due process. Midas recommended Sumo in September 2018, when the price was £1.64.

We looked at the business again in October last year, by which time the stock had risen to £2.60. Despite that increase, it seemed as if there was still plenty more upside, as Cavers had just completed a big acquisition in the US and was excited about publishing more of his own games.

Today, the shares are £4.95. They are 18p lower than Tencent's offer price but initial investors have still tripled their money while those who bought last autumn have made a 90 per cent return in just nine months.

Some may be tempted to sell out now. Some may prefer to wait, either hoping that Tencent clinches its deal or that another bidder comes in with an even higher offer. The latter option seems unlikely.

Tencent has made a generous offer and it has unanimous support from the board, while Sumo's biggest shareholder Perwyn, a large family investment firm, has also backed the transaction.

Whether outside forces prevent Tencent from completing its deal is a different question.

Sumo's board, it would seem, think fears of this nature are misplaced.

Tencent has deep pockets, it is an international business and should help Cavers deliver on his ambition to publish more games and make Sumo even more successful than it already is.

Cavers has also spent years cultivating a collegiate culture at Sumo. While he stands to make millions from the Tencent takeover, close friends say that he would not agree to a takeover deal unless he thought employees would benefit too.

Midas verdict: Sumo is a proud and prosperous Yorkshire business and shareholders have benefited handsomely from its growth. Cautious investors should sell out now just in case Tencent's ambitions are thwarted. The rest should hold out for Tencent's £5.13-a-share prize and hope that the Chinese company does its best by Sumo.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Two lucky Premium Bond holders have each scooped the £1million jackpot with money only invested in February.

One man from County Durham purchased the bond which forms part of a £20,025 holding, meaning a 4,894 per cent return on his outlay.

Meanwhile, the other winner - man from East Riding of Yorkshire - also bought the winning bond in February, and he has the maximum holding of £50,000.

It means they both won in just the fourth draw the bonds were eligible.

Top return: The Premium Bonds were bought in February

On top of the two £1 million prizes, there were five winners of the £100,000 prize and 11 winners of the £50,000 prize.

Many people have piled into Premium Bonds during the pandemic, although since prizes were cut, there has been a drop off in money heading in.

Premium Bonds Winners Prize Area Value of bond £1,000,000 Devon £1,000 £1,000,000 Wales £100 £100,000 Hampshire and Isle of Wight £10,000 £100,000 Wiltshire £12,500 £100,000 Norwich £19,500 £100,000 Avon £2,000 £100,000 Lancashire £4,625 £50,000 Essex £10,000 More August 2021 winners View list of August 2021 winners

Although the two £1million prizes have remained, the other most valuable prizes were impacted by NS&I's cuts, with the number of £100,000, £50,000, £25,000, £10,000 and £5,000 payouts falling at least 40 per cent between November and December.

The cuts meant the average 'prize fund rate' on Bonds fell from 1.4 per cent to 1 per cent in December, with the amount of money paid out to prize winners falling by £31million compared to November and the number of prizes by 1.1million.

It also meant the odds of any £1 Bond winning were reduced from 24,500 to one to 34,500 to one.

Despite the worsened odds and the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the number of Premium Bonds eligible for the draw have continued to rise monthly, albeit now at a slower rate.

Almost 3.2million prizes worth close to £92million were paid out in this month's draw with more than 110 billion bond numbers eligible, up from just circa 109billion in June and 108billion in May.

With £200billion having been stashed away by savers since Covid restrictions began last year, according to Bank of England figures, Premium Bonds have continued to be popular given record low rates of interest currently being offered by other savings providers - the best buy easy-access rate is just 0.5 per cent.

In March 2020, prior to lockdown restrictions increasing, there were just over 86billion eligible bonds for the draw, meaning roughly £24billion has been put into Premium Bonds since the pandemic began.

Premium Bond payouts rise as billions continues to be poured in Month Number of Bonds in the draw Number of prizes paid out Value of prizes paid out November 2020 (Last draw pre-cuts) 97,467,982,557 3,978,286 £113.7m December 2020 (First draw post-cuts) 98,952,302,605 2,868,182 £82.46m February 2021 102,126,660,758 2,960,195 £85.1m April 2021 105,858,958,006 3,068,376 £88.2m July 2021 110,374,058,617 3,199,250 £91,98m

The £92million paid out in prizes this month will give savers some reason to cheer, a rise of almost £10 million since the December 2020 low of £82.46million – the first draw after the cuts.

However it is still a long way short of the £113.7million paid out in the November 2020 prior to the cuts coming into force.

Will there be further cuts this year?

The continued interest in Premium Bonds at a time when savings rates elsewhere are at all-time lows has led some experts to suggest that Britain's best-loved savings product could see more cuts this year.

But despite this trend there appears to be some evidence, at least in the short-term that demand may be waning.

'The 1.1billion increase in Premium bond numbers this month is the lowest increase for several months,' said James Blower, founder of Savings Guru.

'Typically, Premium Bonds have been seeing monthly growth of £1.5billion to £2billion per month.

'Given NS&I has an annual target of just £6billion of net growth this would have meant that NS&I would have either had to see large outflows on other products, which given Premium Bonds now account for over 54 per cent of NS&I's book is unlikely, or they'd have to cut rates to stem inflows.

'The reduction of inflows to £1.1bn for the month, if sustained in the coming months, is likely to reduce the need and likelihood of NS&I cutting rates on Premium Bonds.'

The firm specialises in covering people turned away by traditional providers and was set up to help drivers from overseas get cheap insurance.

Jackson will be spun off following a shareholder vote this month, with investors getting one share in the company for every 40 Pru shares they hold.

The business is then expected to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ‘JXN’.

Prudential is to spin-off its US arm Jackson following a shareholder vote this month, with investors getting one share in the company for every 40 Pru shares they hold

This will leave the Pru focused on Asia and Africa, with headquarters in London. Yesterday, it said it planned to fortify its balance sheet – and its war chest for expansion –by raising up to £2.2billion.

Chief executive Mike Wells said offerings in London and Hong Kong would aim to increase the number of Asian shareholders.

He added: ‘We are continuing to move toward the proposed demerger of Jackson, subject to shareholder approval.

‘The demerger will complete our strategic transformation to focus exclusively on our higher-growth businesses in Asia and Africa.

‘To enhance financial flexibility and de-lever the balance sheet, we continue to consider raising new equity.

'We believe there are clear benefits from increasing our Asian shareholder base and the liquidity of our shares in Hong Kong.’

The Pru posted a paper loss of £3.3billion for the six months to June 30, compared to a £385million profit a year ago.

This was down to complex accounting rules, which say Jackson must be valued differently because it is being spun off, with its ‘fair value’ cut by £5.4billion to £2.2billion.

Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that shareholders had been left no poorer by the accounting change and that the Pru was otherwise ‘thriving’.

It provides life and health insurance, as well as savings products, to 17m people in Asia and Africa, and is listed on the London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore exchanges.

When excluding the Jackson revaluation, it reported a £772million half-year profit, up from £449million the previous year.

That was after new business jumped 29 per cent to £848million.

The Pru's chief exec Mike Wells (pictured), said offerings in London and Hong Kong would aim to increase the number of Asian shareholders

Hyett said: ‘Clearly, Pru’s business model is pedalling along nicely, and we think that bodes well for the long term.

‘The immediate future is less certain, with lockdowns returning across many Asian economies in the face of spiking Delta variant cases, disrupting what is still a very analogue distribution system in many markets – reliant on banks and insurance brokers that can’t open.’

Abid Hussain, analyst at Shore Capital, added: ‘Overall, the equity story and pivot to Asia remains attractive.

Asian insurance remains underpenetrated with growing populations of middle-class requiring products across the health and protection, savings and wealth spectrum.’

The Pru was founded in London, 173 years ago and listed in the London in 1978. Recently, it has undergone a radical overhaul.

Its former UK and European operations – now known as M&G – were successfully spun off and listed in 2019, with the Jackson separation revealed this year.

Its head office staff are in Hong Kong, but Wells said the company had no intention of closing its London base.

He said: ‘We’ve got a tremendously talented staff in London, and they face off with key stakeholders there . We’re not looking to get everybody in one building.’

Yesterday, the stock rose 2.6 per cent, or 38p, to 1489.5p.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The breakfast bar, the island or, sometimes, the peninsula. Never mind what you call it, this kitchen feature has endured for decades in all manner of shapes and sizes.

As it happens, I'm installing one myself in a little house my wife and I are building in Wiltshire, and it's proving difficult. Not the house, that is, but the breakfast bar.

The problem has nothing to do with working out how much overhang to have but finding the right sort of stools on which people can sit.

Convivial: The Wishbone Bar Stool, from Cheshire-based firm Where Saints Go, costs £199 each

That means stools which are comfortable without spending a silly amount of money; stylish, but in keeping with the rest of the furniture and colour scheme.

This is usually where John Lewis comes in — and no one relies on this trusty store more than me — but its range of kitchen stools is lamentable.

Most of them look cheap but are expensive, except perhaps for the Philippe Starck for Kartell Masters Bar Chair (pictured in black), which has the advantage of being different and cleverly put together with a twirly back.

But at £296 each you're talking about close to £1,800 for six. Loaf also does attractive bar stools, which go by the name of Milk because they are 'inspired by the sort of stool you'd perch on while slurping down a cold milkshake'. Perhaps.

Certainly, they have an American diner feel to them, with wipeable leather seats, soft linen backs and some studied detailing at the front. Crucially, the height can be adjusted. But at £325 per stool, your set of six will come to just under £2,000.

Sleek: Philippe Starck for Kartell Masters Bar Chair

Eventually, my search alighted on a website of which I was not familiar: Where Saints Go. Based in Cheshire, this online-only company is the brainchild of Mark Wilman and his wife Tracey Hague, with a sales strap that reads: 'Anything but ordinary.'

Its range comprises some 150 options from sexy, slim cocktail perches to sumptuous seats worthy of a long and comfortable evening of eating, drinking and chattering.

'A lot of our stools are made in India and we go out there regularly to get new ideas... or, at least, we used to go out there a lot,' says Tracey.

Lockdown has worked to the company's advantage, with home owners expanding rather than selling.

'When creating extra space, a new kitchen is often top of people's list, with an island as a centrepiece, around which people can sit,' says Tracey. 'That seems to have happened a lot in the past two or three years, with demand for bar stools increasing in a big way.'

Tracey says a big mistake that's frequently made is over height. Ideally, there should be 25 cm between the counter and the seat. Most kitchen counters are 90 cm high. Consequently, most of Tracey's stools are 66 cm high although some are 75 cm.

One of Where Saints Go's bestsellers is the Wishbone stool, which comes in a variety of colours and is made from ash wood, priced at £199. They have rounded backs that extend to the sides in such a way that you can rest your elbows on them.

The back is sufficiently high so you can lean back without fear of toppling over if you've had one too many margaritas.

If you want something more modern, then Wayfair's Ahlers swivel bar stools, designed by Zipcode, will fit the bill, not least because they cost a reasonable £67.99. 'With restrictions lifted, we are all on the lookout for ways to make our homes more guest-friendly,' says Nadia McCowan Hill, Wayfair's style adviser.

'If you are running low on extra seating, invest in some statement bar stools, which will make a stylish first impression and can be easily tucked away when the time calls for dancing.'

Sticking with a modern look, Wayfair's Carwell bar stool, conceived by Etta Avenue, comes in gold and silver. It may be a bit on the bling side for some tastes, and at £289.99 represents a big investment.

Bar stools are mainly bar chairs these days. The kitchen is the one room where people spend almost all their time, with TVs, comfortable seating and dining. Cooking is only a part of the room's function.

'The kitchen bar stool has to be more of a comfortable chair that is higher. So think of a normal dining chair, elongate the legs and you have the perfect kitchen 'bar chair', says Philippa Thorp, who heads up the Thorp Design company.

A trend is clearly under way. You can expect the choice to widen if this continues, with prices moving in an upward direction.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britons ordering products from overseas are still being hit with big fees by courier, UPS, on their doorsteps - with many unable to find out exactly why.

Whilst there has been an increase in charges since the UK left the EU, with customers now potentially having to pay VAT themselves, higher customs duty and handling charges, other fees are being added on with no explanation.

This is Money previously reported that these charges can reach into the hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds with customers asked to pay up by UPS on their doorstep - or else they will take the parcel away.

In response, a raft of readers contacted us to say they had the same experience, all stating they were given absolutely no explanation for the charges they were handed.

Many UPS customers are still being charged extra 'fees' that the courier cannot explain

Some say the charges listed on the invoice were in the guise of VAT and customs duty, however, the sums didn't add up and when challenged, UPS could not offer an explanation as to what the fees were for.

Others said they were not given an invoice at all, so had no idea they had charges to pay until they were contacted by debt collection agencies.

Despite questioning the amount charged, many said they paid up, as they were concerned about their parcel being returned to the country it came from – or receiving further charges.

One reader, Dominic, said: 'In February this year I ordered some computer parts from a UK retailer who are actually based in Germany.

'The parcel arrived and was delivered by UPS who told me that I had to pay £66.63 in cash or card over the phone. I paid over the phone as I was told if I didn't then it would be sent back to the supplier.

'Shortly afterwards I received a copy of the invoice from the retailer and it clearly showed that I'd paid VAT when I made the purchase and the delivery was free of charge.

'I was confused as I'd been charged "fees" but had nothing to explain what they were and nothing to other than a record on my bank statement to show that I had paid them.'

He said he has tried to contact UPS multiple times but cannot get through on the phone or get a response via email leaving him with little options when trying to get his money back.

This is Money asked UPS why he was unable to get his money back. It said the package was correctly rated for import charges by UPS upon entry into the UK.

However, Dominic paid VAT twice against the shipment because of an error made by the shipper in Germany.

It said it will now be in touch with Dominic to get this rectified.

Meanwhile, other readers said they returned their items after learning how high the delivery cost and other charges were.

However, they were then still charged for the item being returned overseas instead.

Customer, Renee, said: 'I ordered 20 packets of crisps from Belguim for a total cost of €70. However, UPS asked me for an additional £207 in customs and tax charges.

'Needless to say I rejected the parcel. UPS were useless in explaining how it was possible I was being asked to pay £207 for goods worth just €70. Yet they still want the £207.'

UPS delivery drivers have been asking customers to pay for their parcels on their doorsteps

Another reader, Alvyn, added: 'I ordered an item from a company in Germany. When I realised there would be customs and VAT charges costing more than ordering the item in UK I contacted the company to cancel the order.

'They advised me to refuse the delivery and it would be returned to them. I declined the delivery from UPS and I have confirmation the item was received back to the company and they have refunded my payment.

'However I have now received an invoice of £61.70 from UPS for an item that was never delivered and was returned unopened to Germany.'

Some of the fees customers are receiving appear to be disbursement fees, which, according to UPS' website, are given to customers in instances when the courier prepays duties, taxes and other government charges on behalf of the payer.

Others are receiving late fees when a customer has not paid the amount on a UPS invoice by the date it has set.

What are the correct charges? There are now a number of fees that customers must pay when receiving deliveries from overseas, thanks to Brexit. These include VAT, customs duty, handling fees and return charges. To find out exactly what you should be paying - and what might not be right, click here.

On top of the late payment charge, customers may also be charged interest, meaning the fees could quickly rack up.

Other fees are simply deemed as 'government charges' on UPS invoices.

When trying to ascertain exactly what the fees are in regards to, consumers said it has been very difficult to get any answers from UPS, with customer service agents unable to explain why they have received the charges.

When This is Money asked the courier about whether customers should be charged for refusal of delivery, it said it was 'difficult to give a clear answer' without looking at each case individually due to the many different types of shipments it carries.

It added there are some examples when the recipient may be liable for additional charges, even if he or she refuses delivery, for example, where a recipient directs delivery to a third party or in certain circumstances where a third party accepts delivery on behalf of the recipient in the absence of the recipient requesting this.

However, several readers say they never received any communication from UPS so did not know they were due to pay anything.

Meanwhile, in regards to customs charges, UPS said it helps customers move their goods 'smoothly across borders'.

It is not just unknown charges that are proving problematic for customers with other consumers chased by debt collection agencies for not paying their UPS invoices.

Lesley is one such reader who has been contacted by a debt collection agency on behalf of UPS after ordering a gold 1oz Britannia coin from Germany.

She said: 'Shortly after my parcel arrived I got a strange telephone call from a gentleman saying he wanted to assist me with my investment but at no point did he state he was calling from UPS.

'Thinking this to be a scam, I was extremely vague and denied having received a gold coin. Soon after I received a form from UPS, via email asking me to fill in a customs declaration for HMRC.

'Now I have received a letter from a debt collection agency asking for £315 as they say the form was not collected at time of delivery and I had failed to pay the subsequent charge I was billed.

'I have not had a bill from UPS prior to this and I understood that a Gold Brittania is not subject to VAT or import duty and the company I purchased the gold from in Germany had already covered the postage costs.'

Customers said they struggled to get through to anyone at UPS for help understanding bills

This is Money sent this case to UPS which replied: 'Customer satisfaction is important to us. The situation has now been rectified, and we regret any inconvenience this may have caused.'

It confirmed the shipment was incorrectly rated and no charges should have been applied.

Meanwhile, another reader Peter, who is profoundly deaf, also had issues with having fees added after ordering several victorian coins from America.

He was told he was required by UPS to pay £2,480.72, for the 20 per cent VAT on invoice value, before it would deliver the coins.

He made the payment but after investigating realised he had been massively overcharged, as the correct VAT rate for 'collectors items of numismatic interest' is only 5 per cent - meaning he was overcharged by £1,860.54.

As he cannot speak on the phone, he has relied on emails which haven't been answered.

This is Money contacted UPS which said the shipment was rated incorrectly and should have been 5 per cent.

It said it was working to reclaim this payment and will be in touch with Peter on this if it needs additional information.

As reported by This is Money previously, many customers are being charged for investment gold pieces to be delivered, despite the fact they shouldn't have to pay charges.

There should be no VAT on investment gold and no Capital Gains Tax on any British Legal Tender coins, gold or silver.

Despite this, many consumers are still being wrongly charged by UPS when it comes to these deliveries.

Other people have taken to social media to share their frustration with the delivery company.

This Twitter user said his UPS driver expected payment but he wasn't told in advance

Another user said he is not being handed his item until he pays duty but doesn't know how

One UPS customer said his VAT charge was over 20% but he hasn't been told why this is

It is also proving to not just be a UK problem with similar charges being applied to consumers in other European countries receiving parcels from the UK.

Reader, Leny, said: 'My father lives in France and I have sent him parcels containing clothing and dry goods on many occasions.

'Since Brexit I have sent three parcels and each time he has been charged more for import charges, when the goods have a value of £50 and are a gift.

'The most recent charge from UPS is shocking. My dad had to give the driver €30 In cash and received no invoice or receipt at all.'

Overall, every case taken by This is Money to UPS was proven to have incorrect fees attached, highlighting the ongoing problem for consumers.

Courier behaviour has been criticised by Citizens Advice which recently called for fines for delivery companies after saying the way parcels are delivered is not fit for purpose.

It said, despite a large number of people not receiving their deliveries, the majority of couriers receive no penalty for lost or stolen deliveries.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Avon Protection lost almost a quarter of its value after the body armour maker said disruptions in its supply chain would hammer turnover for the next two years.

Around £260million was wiped off Avon's market capitalisation as it slashed revenue forecasts to between £178million and £188million.

This is significantly lower than City forecasts, which put it at more than £200million.

Tough times: Avon Protection lost almost a quarter of its value after the body armour maker said disruptions in its supply chain would hammer turnover for the next two years

The problems will also spill over into the next financial year.

Revenues will be between £231million and £246million – lower than estimates of £258million.

Although the trading updates did not spell out how this would affect profits, the fall in revenues means they will take a hit.

Previously known as Avon Rubber, the company's long history stretches back to the 19th century. It supplied 20million gas masks during the Second World War and floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1949.

Its focus has evolved over the years and it now specialises in body armour and military helmets – as well as gas masks – after selling a dairy division that made tubes and systems to milk and monitor cows.

The FTSE250 defence contractor and American armed forces supplier said there had been a series of order delays, supply chain disruptions and a 'tight' US labour market, which means employers are having to compete for workers.

Hold-ups to a specific order – for M50 gas masks – were blamed on 'procurement bottlenecks'.

Investors also took badly to another warning that there are 'remaining uncertainties' as to when it will receive and ship other orders before the end of the financial year.

Shares in Avon – which has been an outperformer on the stock market in recent years – nosedived by 27.7 per cent, or 818p, to 2132p last night. Avon's day in the doldrums did little to hold back the wider mid-cap index, which rose 0.2 per cent, or 41.68 points, to 23788.45.

The larger FTSE100 also made gains, advancing 0.4 per cent, or 25.48 points, to 7218.71.

The rise saw the Footsie cap off its longest weekly winning streak since November.

Oil prices held steady at $71 a barrel after slides triggered by fears of the spread of the Delta variant, which traders worry could lead to more lockdowns that will lessen demand.

Goldman Sachs analysts said a recent call from the US for Opec nations to increase the amount of oil they produce is unlikely to be heeded in the short term.

BP slipped 0.5 per cent, or 1.6p, to 305.35p, while Shell finished down 1.1 per cent, down 15.4p, to 1438.8p.

Thungela Resources shot higher after turnover skyrocketed by 500 per cent to £490million in its maiden results as an independent company.

The thermal coal group was spun off from Anglo American in June into a separate firm on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges. It swung from a £6million loss in the first half of 2020 to a £17million profit in the same period of this year. Shares rose 6.5 per cent, or 14.7p, or 242.4p.

Traders also snapped up BHP stock, which climbed 1.5 per cent, or 34p, to 2322.5p.

The rise comes as anticipation in the City grows that the world's largest mining company will deliver a verdict on the future of its petrol business in annual results next week.

Elsewhere, Packaging company Essentra has hired Dupsy Abiola, a former Dragons' Den contestant whose father once ran for president in Nigeria, as part of a new scheme of appointing a trainee to the company's board.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The magazine publisher behind The Week is on the verge of being sold to Future, the FTSE 250- listed media group.

Future, which also owns Marie Claire and football magazine FourFourTwo, is in 'advanced' discussions with the private equity owners of Dennis Publishing about a takeover of a large number of the company's most well-known publications.

A report by Sky News suggested a £300million deal could be announced as early as this week.

Hot off the press: Future is in 'advanced' discussions with the private equity owners of Dennis Publishing about a takeover of a large number of the company's most well-known publications

Other Dennis titles that could fall into Future's hands include MoneyWeek and Kiplinger's Personal Finance.

However, the report said Future won't be acquiring Viz, the satirical magazine.

Dennis Publishing is owned by Exponent, a UK-based private equity firm. The buyout shop hired bankers from Liontree Advisors earlier this year to find a buyer for some or all of Dennis Publishing.

Reports suggest that Future has been battling it out for Dennis Publishing with other media giants such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.

Future is led by Zillah Byng-Thorne, under whose leadership the company has expanded rapidly into a digitally-led media business and launched a series of daring takeovers.

Last year, it bought price comparison website GoCompare for £594million.

A spokesman for Future declined to comment.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice is set to raise its bid for Morrison's next week following rival Fortress's £6.7bn offer

Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) will start its fightback with a higher bid for Morrisons early next week, after the deadline to raise its offer was extended.

The US private equity firm was left reeling after its rival, a consortium led by Fortress private equity, increased its bid for the supermarket group from £6.3billion to £6.7billion, equivalent to 272p-per-share.

CD&R, whose bid is being headed by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, was said to be blind-sided by the move as it had been hoping to make its first formal offer for around 265p per share by last night’s deadline.

But yesterday insiders said it had the firepower to raise its bid and was preparing to enter the race next week with a higher offer and a fresh slate of pledges to protect the grocer’s legacy.

It was given a boost as the Takeover Panel extended the deadline to 5pm on August 20.

The date for shareholders to vote on Fortress’s offer has also been pushed back to August 27.

Analysts have suggested offers between 270p and 280p are competitive, although one claimed the real price is 314p per share, or £7.7billion.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Money Mail readers today tell ministers loud and clear that laws are needed now to save our cash.

We asked you to contribute to the Government’s crucial consultation on cash — and were overwhelmed by your response.

We have packaged up hundreds of your heartfelt letters and emails and sent them in a powerful dossier to the Treasury to ensure your voices are heard.

Threat: We asked you to contribute to the Government’s crucial consultation on cash - and were overwhelmed by your response.

For years, campaigners have been warning about the decline of coins and notes and how the elderly and vulnerable risked being cut off from cash.

In the meantime, ATMs have been turned off, banks have continued to axe hundreds of branches, Post Offices are under threat and now shops are refusing to accept cash.

Your message to the Government was clear: we must not delay introducing laws to protect cash and those who rely on it.

Grandparents told us how they cherish giving pocket money to their grandchildren, while carers of those with learning disabilities say they could not get by without it.

Others in their 80s and 90s say they do not feel comfortable using cards at this stage of their lives.

Some of the most distressing letters came from people who have lost their local bank branch. They now face long car or bus journeys to the nearest bank, while the most vulnerable say they have been forced to rely on carers to access their own money.

It has been almost 18 months since Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged new laws to protect cash while millions still rely on it.

And last month the Government finally began consulting on new legislation to halt the endless stream of closures.

These may include giving the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) the power to block banks from closing branches in communities which are dependent on them.

And nine in ten neighbourhoods could get the legal right to have somewhere to withdraw cash for free no more than 1km away.

But experts warn new laws could take at least two years to enforce — leaving scores of towns and villages at risk of becoming cash deserts.

I don't know what dad would do without it 'Ignored': World War II veteran George Armitt relies on cash and cheques to pay for everything At 94, World War II veteran George Armitt relies on cash and cheques to pay for everything. But the great-grandfather-of-12 now has to ask his 57-year-old son Jonathan to withdraw cash for him. George (pictured with late wife José) is a NatWest customer and lives in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire — but his nearest branch is two miles away and he is now too frail to make the journey. And while George could visit an ATM to take out cash, he prefers ‘face-to-face’ contact over self-service machines. In fact, Jonathan only helped him apply for his first debit card a few months ago, when George found out he could no longer use his Post Office card to withdraw cash from his pension. Jonathan, his full-time carer, says: ‘I am concerned about what would happen if he used a debit card himself and entered his PIN incorrectly.’ And as he approaches his 95th birthday this month, George feels ignored by the Government and his bank. He says: ‘They only listen to the customers who are comfortable with tech. I don’t trust banks any more, as all they think about is their profit.’ Jonathan believes the Financial Conduct Authority should oversee a transparent consultation process if a bank wants to close a branch. ‘It should intervene if a small community is going to be badly affected.’

Bank branch betrayal

Many readers say bank branches are the only places they feel comfortable taking out cash.

But more than 4,200 have shut for good since 2015 — with 801 closing since the first lockdown and another 103 set to go this year, says consumer group Which?

Under FCA guidelines, banks and building societies have to demonstrate that they have considered the impact axing a branch could have on their customers’ needs.

But there is nothing to stop them going ahead with a closure. And with many banks keen to save on overheads, they often plough ahead, blaming low footfall as more customers sign up for online banking.

Gill Harris, who cares for two sons with learning disabilities, has to drive more than 20 miles to visit her nearest Barclays branch. Steven, 52, and Richard, 50, cannot use cards and rely on coins and notes to pay for activities at their local day centre.

It used to take the former Barclays cashier just nine minutes to get to her nearest branch in Needham Market — five miles from her home in Claydon, Suffolk.

But the branch shut in 2014, forcing her to drive to the next nearest branch in Stowmarket, a 15-minute drive away.

Since that closed last month, Gill, 75, a widow, has to drive to Bury St Edmunds — a one-hour round trip. She says: ‘It makes me so angry — banks aren’t thinking of their customers, only profits.’

Ministers are consulting on giving the FCA powers which could include the ability to fine banks if they axe vital branches — in areas with few places residents can take out cash — or prevent closures.

It’s a proposal Jim Storey, 67, a trustee of the Lions Club of Fleet, supports. The club helps low-income residents in the Hampshire town.

Jim wrote to HSBC when he heard its branch was closing. It meant volunteers would have to drive ten miles away with up to £30,000 in cash after hosting events.

But Jim never got a reply and the branch closed in June.

Lifeline: For years, campaigners have been warning about the decline of coins and notes and how the elderly and vulnerable risked being cut off from cash

He says: ‘If banks are no longer serving customers, then giving a watchdog the legal right to stop them is the only solution.’

Age UK, which campaigns for older people, is one of several charities calling for new laws to strengthen the FCA’s powers.

Director Caroline Abrahams says: ‘The tsunami of branch closures and rapid move towards online and mobile banking, has been detrimental to many older people’s financial independence.

‘The Government must consider new legislation to protect people’s access to their money.’

A Barclays spokesman says it would be in touch with Gill to see how it could support her family.

HSBC says it is sorry if Jim did not receive a reply from the bank.

Withdrawal of the ATMs

Thousands of ATMs were closed during lockdown when the businesses they were based in or near closed their doors.

And just under 4,000 are yet to reopen, according to the UK’s largest ATM network Link.

And of the cash machines left, one in four charge a fee of up to £2 to make a withdrawal.

Link has committed to protecting free ATMs that are more than 1km away from somewhere else customers can access cash fee-free. But some readers say this is not enough.

David Richardson, 77, lives in a Shropshire town with one bank branch, a Post Office and two ATMs. Sometimes, he is unable to take cash out of one ATM because it is empty.

David, a retired IT worker, says: ‘It is obviously over used, so I would think that one free cash machine for every 1km of land would not be enough.’

And while cash machines in bank branches often allow customers to pay in notes, most ATMS do not.

I’ve lost my local branch twice now Retired primary school teacher Jane has to drive six miles to visit her nearest NatWest branch. Jane Prowse, a retired primary school teacher, switched banks twice after branch closures. But three years ago, the last bank in her Devon town of Bovey Tracey closed its doors and now Jane has to drive six miles to Newton Abbott to visit her nearest NatWest branch. Jane (pictured with her dog, Layla) has no idea what she will do if she has to surrender her driving licence. The 77-year-old, who lives with husband Clive, 71, uses cash and cheques to pay for almost everything — and after a friend came close to being scammed, she is keen to stick to what she knows. The former HSBC customer switched to NatWest several years ago, but it later shut its doors and then Lloyds swiftly followed suit in 2018. Jane says: ‘I do feel let down by the Government and the banks — I think a lot of other elderly people feel the same. ‘This consultation comes too late for people like me, when all of the banks have already left us.’ She adds: ‘Ideally, the banks will start bringing back branches to where they are needed, rather than just sticking to the status quo.’

Protect our post offices

Countless readers hailed their local Post Office as a safe and convenient place to access cash.Customers of most banks have been able to withdraw and deposit coins and notes there since 2017.

Around 95 per cent of the population lives within a mile of a Post Office, so most should have one within walking distance.

A retired nurse told us her Post Office in Stanton, a village near Bury St Edmunds, is ‘vital to all’.

Beryl, 76, says: ‘The Post Office is a valued service because so many of us rely on cash.’

However, the services provided at the Post Office rely on the banks to subsidise them, and in 2019 Barclays tried to pull out of its Banking Framework agreement.

It gave in to a hard-fought campaign by Money Mail and reversed the decision. However, the agreement remains voluntary.

Time to act is running out

Cash use has been declining for some time, as more people rely on cards and contactless payments methods instead.

The pandemic accelerated this trend further, with many shops refusing to accept cash for fear of spreading the virus through contaminated notes and coins.

A Money Mail poll earlier this year found one in five shoppers had been barred from paying this way since non-essential retailers re-opened in April.

This is despite research published by the Bank of England last year stating that shoppers were at low risk of catching the virus from touching cash.

Priceless: Your message for the Government over its crucial consultation on cash was clear -we cannot afford to delay introducing laws to protect it and those who rely on it

Many readers say they fear being left behind. Cliff Gilbert, 66, is the treasurer of his village hall in Gayton, Staffordshire.

He helps to run around 20 events each year, including pop-up cafes and community bar nights.

But as the hall has no broadband and a very poor mobile signal, Cliff and his colleagues are not able to process card payments.

‘The removal of cash as a payment option for the future would threaten the survival of our village hall,’ he writes.

Natalie Ceeney, author of the Access To Cash Review, says: ‘We know that between five and eight million people still need cash.

‘The infrastructure needed to support it is already starting to crumble.’

Last year, just 17 per cent of payments were made with cash, down from 35 per cent in 2019.

The Treasury’s consultation on cash closes on September 23. But campaigners warn we need to make faster progress.

Ministers have known that Britain is at risk of sleepwalking into a cashless society since Ms Ceeney’s Access to Cash Review in 2019.

And Baroness (Ros) Altmann, a former pensions minister, says: ‘It is very unlikely that these laws will come into place for at least two years — that would be 2023 at the earliest.

By then, many more bank branches may have closed down, so the Government should make sure we return to the cash access we have today and not how it will be then.’

James Murray, the Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, says: ‘We know this kind of consultation has been needed for years, so why is the Government only starting it now?

‘Even as overall cash use declines, it will still be a vital means of payment for many people.’

A Treasury spokesman says: We know that cash remains vital for millions of people and we are committed to protecting access to cash across the UK.

‘That’s why we are consulting on proposals for new laws to make sure people only need to travel a reasonable distance to pay in or take out cash.’

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Football may not have made it home but you could still find a place for sport in your investment portfolio.

From teams to sponsorship brands and gym equipment, there are plenty of ways to invest in sport.

As with any investments, a diverse portfolio is essential, so don't just back sport related firms - make them part of your wider investing strategy if you are interested.

Here is how to kick off the sports investment part of your portfolio.

Investors could gain exposure by backing sports science businesses or even the companies competing for broadcast rights

How to invest in sport

Sport has become big business. It's no longer just about football matches or races but sponsorship and TV rights.

Take football, for example. Results are important on the pitch but teams rely on revenue from broadcasting deals, sponsorship and media work.

Speaking on a recent eToro webinar, former England and Manchester United defender Gary Neville said there has been a major shift in football during his career, which ran from 1994 to 2011.

Invest in the sports you love webinar This is Money editor Simon Lambert, England legend Gary Neville, Formula E champion Antonio Felix da Costa and eToro analyst Adam Vettese discuss the parallels between investing and sport, while taking a closer look at some of the top sports brands which are making the news and why. Check out the webinar here. The content that will be discussed is intended for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or investment recommendation.

This includes a move towards sports science and nutrition as well as more demand for content.

He says: 'The content demand from football players in the 1990s may have been the odd interview but now there is social media, club channels, magazines. It is continuous and constant.'

Neville says marketing and PR has become a core part of the business of running a football club.

Investors could gain exposure to this area by backing sports science businesses or even the companies competing for broadcast rights such as BT and Amazon.

You can also invest in some of the top football teams.

Manchester United is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and you will also find Scottish Giants Celtic on the London Stock Exchange and Roma, Juventus, and Lazio on Italy’s stockmarket.

Additionally, football fans can invest in Borussia Dortmund in Germany or Ajax in The Netherlands.

The performance of these companies on the stock market will be dictated by more than just how they perform on the pitch.

It will be influenced by sponsorship deals, the talent a team attracts as well as external factors such as the behaviour of players, fans or being unable to welcome crowds such as during the pandemic.

Football players and teams will also have deals with sporting and fashion brands such as Nike and Adidas, both of which are publicly listed companies.

Football isn’t the only sport that investors can make money from, though. Motor racing fans can invest in Formula One.

This could be done by backing car manufacturers behind the teams such as Ferrari, Mercedes (under Daimler AG) and Renault as well as the Liberty Formula One Group, which runs the sport.

Formula E is also growing in popularity. The sport focuses on drivers and teams with electric cars.

Current FIA Formula E Drivers' Champion António Félix da Costa said in the eToro webinar that the sport is showcasing what manufacturers and car brands, such as BMW, are doing with electric vehicles that are now being used in the real world as the UK moves away from petrol and diesel engines.

It's also a chance for emerging electric car brands such as Nio to show what they can do and investors can also back them on the stock market.

Yet there are still more ways to invest beyond the football pitch and the racetrack.

Keep an eye on sport and fitness trends

Adam Vettese, a market analyst for eToro, says investors can try to spot trends early to get the best profits.

For example, Nasdaq-listed exercise bike maker Peloton became a stay-at-home stock during the pandemic as gyms were closed and people took to exercising from home.

Peloton’s share price was $29 when it listed on the Nasdaq in September 2019 and was at $119 as of 22 July. A $100 investment made in September 2019 would now be worth $410- a 310 per cent gain. The stock is up 96.61 per cent based on its one-year performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.

He says: 'Often there is a mental barrier to investing. You don’t need an economics degree. It can be fairly simple, for example, if people are going to be working at home then something like Peloton is going to be successful.

'You just have to work out how that translates into stock market movements.'

How to choose a sporting stock

The same investing rules apply when choosing sporting stocks. Vettese says the main factors are fundamental and technical analysis.

Fundamental analysis means looking at the value of the company, its profits, assets, how its industry is performing and how the stock compares.

The technical side includes looking at the historical share price of a company and assessing if history will repeat itself.

Vettese of eToro says: 'The most important thing is to invest in something you believe in.

'Something that is driving your own consumer decisions can often make good logic for your investor decisions.'

A game of two halves

You wouldn’t fill a football team with attackers and no defensive players.

Similarly, with a sport-focused part of an investment portfolio it helps to be diverse by including different types of businesses.

This way, if one stock does badly, the wider portfolio could be supported by potentially better performance of other investments.

For example, Peloton’s stock performed well during national lockdowns, but it has dropped off as gyms reopened and demand for home workouts reduced.

Vettese adds: 'Diversifying across different industries lets you ride out unforeseen events in the market and it also allows you to account for changes you have no control over such as interest rates.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@England's run to the World Cup semi-finals saw the team do much better than expected.

Already it is being claimed that this will have helped the economy, as fans spent more. Can this be true?

Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, joins Simon Lambert on the Investing Show to discuss whether the World Cup has boosted the UK economy, how long the effect lasts and which companies will do well off the back of it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A highly-anticipated auction to buy inhaler maker Vectura was dramatically called off at the eleventh hour last night.

Tobacco giant Philip Morris International (PMI) and American private equity firm The Carlyle Group had been preparing to go head-to-head in a five-day bidding war, starting today, for FTSE 250-listed company Vectura.

The pair had been putting in offers for the company since May but had reached a deadlock.

Tobacco giant Philip Morris and American private equity firm The Carlyle Group had been preparing to go head-to-head in a five-day bidding war for FTSE 250-listed company Vectura

This led all three groups to agree to a rare auction process, overseen by the Takeover Panel, which aimed to wrap up the saga.

But with just 27 minutes to go before a 5pm deadline, Carlyle withdrew from the battle by declaring its latest offer of 155p per share was the highest that it would go, scuppering the need for an auction.

Carlyle made the approach, which values Vectura at £958million, last Friday. But less than 48 hours later PMI leapfrogged it with a 165p offer, valuing the company at £1.02billion.

All eyes are now on Vectura’s board which will need to weigh up the two bids.

If it goes with Carlyle, the private equity group will need to gain support from 75 per cent of shareholders.

If PMI is successful, it will only need backing from 50 per cent after it changed the structure of its offer.

Based in the Wiltshire town of Chippenham, Vectura specialises in making inhalers and nebulisers.

The company also works with pharmaceutical companies such as Hikma and Glaxosmithkline to convert their medicines into powders that can be inhaled.

Its profile has been raised during the pandemic by its work with Inspira Pharmaceuticals to develop a Covid vaccine.

The race to buy Vectura has been one of the most controversial takeover battles in recent years.

On the one hand fears have been raised in the City that Carlyle’s interest means that it could become the latest in a string of companies to fall prey to a private equity buyout.

But the swoop by Marlboro cigarette maker PMI triggered outrage from health campaigners and politicians.

PMI says it is trying to transform into a health and wellness company as it moves away from tobacco.

The American Lung Association said it was ‘reprehensible’ that a cigarette maker that has profited from damaging people’s lungs could buy a company that treats them.

Health experts have warned that Vectura could be blocked from taking part in research programmes with universities if it is bought by PMI.

Carlyle emphasised these points last night, saying that it believed its lower offer still provided the biggest benefits to ‘Vectura and its broader stakeholders’.

It added that it believed its tie-up would offer ‘significant opportunity to Vectura’s many employees (particularly Vectura’s leading scientists), suppliers, customers and research partners’.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tomorrow, school leavers across the country will find out their A-Level results and, more importantly, where they'll be heading to University.

There are now estimated to be 2.5 million students enrolled at UK higher education institutions, according to Universities UK.

With many learning to manage serious amounts of money for the first time, this is big business for banks.

So as the start of the new academic year draws near, they are once again battling it out to woo freshers and undergraduates alike into opening an account with them.

Do your homework: Young adults starting university are eligible for a student account that often comes with benefits and interest-free overdrafts

They might not be stashing away savings right now, but banks are keen to snap up today's students because, when they hopefully start earning graduate salaries, they can be valuable customers for decades to come.

Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: 'Student account providers have not held back with tweaking their perks this year, which are enticing and could save students some cash.

'Unlike last year, two banks are offering a free cash incentive upon opening, namely HSBC with £80 and NatWest with £50, which was unheard of in 2020 for student accounts.

'Since the last academic year there is a better variety of perks, so students can debate which type of account will give them the most value based on their spending habits.'

Students can therefore find plenty of cost-saving perks - but they would be wise to consider which account best suits their spending habits before committing.

Things like overdraft limits, interest charges and overseas transaction fees can all make a dent in their budget if they are caught unawares.

This is Money has balanced the perks and the terms and conditions to pick out some of the best options for those heading to university next month.

What are the perks?

Students can benefit from a free 12-month subscription to Perlego – an online library containing over 500,000 academic and non-fiction books.

A Perlego subscription usually costs £96 a year, so this could be a considerable bonus for a student looking to save some money on study materials.

Most banks either prevent students from exceeding their arranged overdraft limit or wont charge them for doing so - but it's important to double check to avoid any nasty surprises

The Barclays app also gives you lots of ways to track your spending – for example, allowing you to compare how much you spend at shops and other businesses month by month.

How big is the overdraft?

Barclays provides an interest-free buffer of £500 during the first term.

But this increases up to £1,000 in the first year and then up to £2,000 in Year two and finally up to £3,000 in the third year and beyond.

Barclays does not offer unarranged overdrafts, so you will not be able to exceed your overdraft limit.

What to watch out for

When using your Barclays debit card abroad you'll be hit with a 2.99 per cent transaction fee for any payment or cash withdrawal.

Can I apply?

To apply you'll need to be at least 18 and in full-time higher education, or a higher apprenticeship (level 4+).

What are the perks?

Students can earn up to 15 per cent cashback at selected retailers, including the Co-op, Costa and Sky, simply by registering for Everyday Offers via their online banking.

The account also comes with promotional code that will enable students to enjoy a free TOTUM card for up to three years.

A TOTUM card gives students access to over 350 UK discounts on the high street and online at places like the Co-op, Fender, Halfords, Garmin, Odeon and Grenade.

The card would otherwise cost £24.99 for the same time period.

The account also comes with a free International Student Identity Card, allowing access to over 150,000 international discounts in over 130 countries including numerous London tourist attractions.

How big is the overdraft?

Students can get up to £1,500 in years 1-3 and up to £2,000 in years 4-6.

The overdraft starts at £500 for the first six months, then you can apply to increase it to £1,000 in months seven to nine, and up to £1,500 from month ten.

Unarranged overdraft requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and, where they are authorised, no charges are applied.

What to watch out for

Students may decide to look for the biggest fee-free overdraft they can find if they are set to live on a tight budget

When abroad you will be subject to a foreign currency transaction fee of 2.99 per cent for every payment or cash withdrawal you make.

Can I apply?

You can apply if you're aged 17 or over, but to apply for an arranged overdraft you must be 18 or over.

You also need to have lived at a permanent UK address for the past three years, and be studying on a full-time course that lasts for at least two years, or on a one-year access course leading on to a full-time degree.

What are the perks?

Those who register for Everyday Offers can earn up to 15 per cent cashback at selected retailers, including the Co-op, Costa and Sky, but to benefit they will need to activate the offers they're interested in online.

For keen savers, the account enables students to round up card payments and put the spare change from each purchase into a Halifax savings account.

How big is the overdraft?

It allows for an interest-free arranged overdraft up to £1,500 for the length of the course, plus an extra year after graduation - up to a maximum of 6 years in total.

Unarranged overdraft requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and, where they are authorised, no charges are applied.

HSBC are offering students a £80 cash incentive and the choice of a £20 Uber Eats voucher or a year of unlimited next-day delivery with ASOS Premier

What to watch out for

When abroad you will be subject to a foreign currency transaction fee of 2.99 per cent for every payment or cash withdrawal you make.

Can I apply?

To apply for this account you'll need to be aged 18 or over and on a degree course or equivalent full-time education.

What are the perks?

This HSBC account comes with a tantalising £80 cash bribe, which itself could be enough to sway some students to join.

It also offers the choice of a £20 Uber Eats voucher or a year of unlimited next-day delivery with ASOS Premier, worth £9.95 a year.

To qualify, students need to make five debit card transactions within a month of opening the account.

How big is the overdraft?

Students get an interest-free limit of up to £1,000 in their first year, which could rise to £3,000 by their third year.

Both arranged and unarranged borrowing is charged at 0 per cent on student accounts.

However, if a student does go over their arranged overdraft limit HSBC will consider an unarranged request and will make the payment if it can, subject to status.

What to watch out for

If an account holder pays for something using their HSBC Visa debit card while outside the UK, they'll need to pay a non-sterling transaction fee of 2.75 per cent per transaction.

If they withdraw money from an ATM outside the UK, they'll also need to pay a 'non sterling cash fee' of 2 per cent. This is limited to a minimum and maximum charge of £1.75 and £5.00 respectively.

Can I apply?

To qualify you need to be 18 or over and to have lived in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man for at least three years.

You can't have another student account elsewhere, and you will need proof you've been accepted on to a qualifying course at a UK university or college.

TOTUM offers include 10 per cent off at The Co-op

25 per cent off Odeon student-priced tickets

Discounts from Apple, 16-25 Railcard, LOOKFANTASTIC, Superdrug, New Look, Jack Wills, Zavvi, PizzaExpress, ASOS, CrossCountry Trains, Missguided, Domino's, Thorpe Park and lots more

What are the perks?

Avid savers can round up their card payments to the nearest pound, with the difference being transferred to a Lloyds Bank savings account.

Students can also get up to 15 per cent cashback with Everyday Offers when using the card at selected retailers including the Co-op, Costa and Sky.

Those who open their account by 31 October can also enjoy a free TOTUM card for up to three years.

How big is the overdraft?

With a Lloyds Student Account, customers can apply for an interest-free tiered arranged overdraft of up to £1,500 in years one to three and up to £2,000 in years four to five.

The overdraft starts at £500 for the first six months, then they can apply to increase it to £1,000 in months seven to nine, and up to £1,500 from month ten.

Unarranged overdraft requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and, where they are authorised, no charges are applied.

What to watch out for

When abroad you will be subject to a foreign currency transaction fee of 2.99 per cent for every payment or cash withdrawal you make.

Can I apply?

You can apply for this account if you're 17 or over and have been a resident in the UK for at least three years.

You'll also need to show you'll be studying full-time on a course of at least two years' duration, or a one-year full-time access course leading to a degree.

What are the perks?

This could be a great card for those who expect to travel during their time at university, as Nationwide's card is free to use abroad.

Along with Barclays, it is also one of the best accounts on the market for overdrafts.

By the end of a three-year university course, customers of Nationwide can get up to £3,000 interest-free, provided they request an increase every year.

Watch out for the overdraft trap While many banks will simply block students from exceeding their interest-free buffer, some will charge student borrowers overdraft rates of close to 40 per cent if they borrow too much. For example, TSB - which offers a fee-free overdraft of up to £1,500 - will charge 39.9 per cent if students exceed that. Its account pays 5 per cent interest on balances of up to £500, so it may be better suited to those who plan to keep their account in credit. If it's a large overdraft they are after, students can find higher interest-free limits elsewhere. It is also worth noting banks will not necessarily give applicants the maximum fee-free overdraft they advertise on their websites. The limit can often be based on the student's credit score. Students should check their score before they apply (it is free to do so) and try and improve it if they can. If students don't have any other borrowing, they can try and give their score a boost in other ways, such as by registering to vote, or registering their mobile phone contract in their own name rather than a parent's.

The buffer is £1,000 in year one and £2,000 in year two, and unlike some other accounts, students will get the full amount if they are accepted for an overdraft, rather than a potentially lower limit.

How big is the overdraft?

Students can request up to £1,000 in each year of study, to a maximum of £3,000 in the third year.

FlexStudent is designed to prevent students from going over their arranged overdraft limit.

Can I apply?

Customers need to be 18 or over and not have a student account with another provider - although they can switch an existing student account over to Nationwide.

They must also have been accepted onto a full-time UCAS course of at least 2 years in the UK, and have an unconditional offer.

In addition they will also need to pay in at least £500 each term from the date they open their FlexStudent account.

What are the perks?

Similar to HSBC, both NatWest and RBS are whetting the appetite of students with a cash bribe - though they are only offering £50 rather than £80.

Also on offer is a four-year tastecard membership, giving students the chance to get two meals for the price of one, or 50 per cent off their food bill, at thousands of UK restaurants - as well as discounts at the cinema.

A tastecard membership usually costs £34.99 a year, so this could equate to a total £139.96 saving over four years for someone who is likely to take advantage of this perk.

How big is the overdraft?

Both NatWest and RBS allow for an interest free overdraft up to £2000, although during the first term this is limited to £500.

Both accounts will prevent students from being able to dip into their unarranged overdraft.

Natwest and RBS are offering both a £50 cash bribe and a four year tastecard membership to lure students in.

What to watch out for

The foreign currency conversion fee for payments and withdrawals outside the UK is 2.75 per cent of any transaction.

Can I apply?

Students must be 17 or over and a British Citizen who has been living in the UK for at least 3 years.

They need to be a full time undergraduate student on at least a two year course at a UK University or College, or completing a full-time postgraduate or nursing course lasting a year or more.

What are the perks?

The big money saver with this account is a free, four-year 16-25 Railcard, which will enable students to shave a third off their rail travel in the UK.

A 16-25 Railcard costs £30 each year to renew, so over a four year period it could save a total of £120.

Once they switch on Retailer Offers in online or mobile banking, customers will also be able to choose which offers to save to their card and benefit from up to 15 per cent cashback when they spend in those stores.

How big is the overdraft?

Santanders allow for an interest-free arranged overdraft of £1,500 in the first three years, £1,800 in year four and £2,000 if they stay on to year five.

Santander's 123 Student account has long been seen as one of the best offers around, with a free four-year 16-25 Railcard thrown in.

When a customer tries to make a payment that would take them into an unarranged overdraft, Santander makes the decision on whether to allow or reject the payment based on their individual circumstances.

If it allows a payment, it will take them into an unarranged overdraft, but it does not charge interest or fees for unarranged overdrafts on the account.

What to watch out for

The foreign currency conversion fee for payments and withdrawals outside the UK is 2.95 per cent of any transaction.

However, the bank does not charge a fee for withdrawals from Santander cash machines in Spain.

Can I apply?

Students must be 18 or over, live in the UK permanently, and be able to pay in at least £500 per academic term.

They need to be studying or about to begin an undergraduate course that is at least two years in length, or a level four to seven apprenticeship.

If they are about to begin a course, they must have an unconditional or 'confirmed conditional' offer before they apply.

Customers must not already have an existing Santander current account, and if they do, they will need to transfer it to a student one.

What are the perks?

TSB is one of the only interest-earning accounts, and will pay five per cent interest on balances up to £500.

How big is the overdraft?

Your overdraft starts at £500 for the first six months, then you can apply to increase it to £1,000 in months seven to nine, and up to £1,500 from month ten.

What to watch out for

Those who exceed their arranged overdraft limit, will incur interest rate charges at 39.99 per cent.

There is also a 2.99 per cent foreign transaction fee when using the card abroad.

However, if students have a 'spend and save plus' account there are no transaction fees.

Can I apply?

To have a student account you must be 17 or over (18 or over if it includes an overdraft); have been a resident in the UK for at least three years; and be studying for a full time course that lasts for a minimum of two years, or a one-year access course leading onto a full-time degree.

Simon takes aim at London's low emission zone expansion - it's less than three months away and riddled with inconsistencies.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As if 2020 wasn’t already proving to be a painful enough year, fraud has soared in lockdown.

Fraud victims are now losing at least £11.5million a day but the real total is estimated at £80million, as only about 15 per cent of cases go reported.

Cases are up 43 per cent in lockdown, according to Action Fraud figures, and the amount lost is up a staggering 286 per cent – meaning a victim loses £8,000 of their savings in average every minute.

So could you fall victim to lockdown fraud?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost discuss how people are being conned, the red flags to watch out for, what your rights are if you fall victim and why it’s not enough to think it won’t happen to you.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Canadian company BMO Financial has more than 12million customers worldwide, to whom it offers a range of banking and wealth management services.

Its tentacles extend as far as the UK where it runs a successful investment operation.

Among the many funds it manages is F&C, the country's oldest investment trust, which was formed in 1868 and in more recent times has delivered 50 consecutive years of dividend growth for shareholders.

The manager of F&C is Paul Niven who in the past three years has also overseen the successful formation of a range of low-cost, actively managed funds at BMO.

Labelled Universal MAP (Multi-Asset Portfolio), these 11 funds have just collectively gone through the £1billion barrier.

Niven says the investment funds fill a 'gap' in the market – sitting between low-cost passive funds (which typically replicate the performance of a specific stock market index) and higher cost active funds run by portfolio managers who make stock selection decisions in the hope of stellar returns.

Six of the funds have annual charges of 0.29 per cent, with the five remaining 'sustainable' funds having slightly higher charges of 0.39 per cent.

To put these costs into context, most actively managed investment funds have total annual charges in excess of one per cent.

'The funds have widespread appeal,' says Niven.

'They're attractive to costconscious investors, provide a core investment proposition for many financial advisers and are also popular in the defined contribution pensions market where many investors have to manage their own plans.'

The funds range in risk from 'defensive' to 'adventurous' and all have targeted returns.

So, in the case of Universal MAP Balanced, the most popular fund, the target is an average annual return over five years of inflation plus three per cent – inflation being measured by the consumer prices index.

Although the fund is only three-and-a-half years old, it has so far delivered a respectable return of 31 per cent, comfortably outperforming the FTSE All-Share Index over the same period.

All 11 funds invest in a mix of equities, bonds and cash – there are no holdings in unquoted companies, property or alternative assets such as private equity. The more cautious the fund is, the greater the slice of assets in bonds and cash.

In the case of Balanced, the current asset split is 62.5 per cent (equities), 35.8 per cent (bonds) and 1.7 per cent (cash).

The Universal MAP funds are run by a 15-strong multi-asset team based in London and Edinburgh.

The 'strategic' asset allocation for each fund is reviewed each quarter, thereby enabling shifts to be made to take advantage of any short-term investment opportunities.

Individual stock selections are made by BMO's investment teams who specialise in specific geographic areas and, says Niven, 'are expected to deliver outperformance'.

The Balanced fund has typically had equity exposure in the mid- 50 per cent range.

The current higher exposure, says Niven, reflects BMO's 'confidence' in equities. 'They're not cheap,' he adds, 'but they're more attractive than other assets.'

Although the £355 million Balanced fund is the biggest among the Universal MAP range, Niven says the sustainable fund offerings are in the 'ascendancy'.

There is also an income fund that strives to reward investors with an annual income equivalent to at least four per cent.

The stock market code for Universal MAP Balanced is BF99W06.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Most of those travelling to Europe this summer will be preoccupied with adhering to new Covid restrictions - but holidaymakers are now being urged not to forget the new travel rules introduced after Brexit.

As most have not been abroad since the pandemic hit early last year, only three months after the new Brexit rules came into effect, they may not be aware of the changes to things like health cover, pet travel and driving abroad.

One of the most important rule changes relates to the expiry date on UK passports.

Before Brexit, a UK passport only needed to be valid for the duration of the visit. However, the new rules state that passport holders must have at least six months before expiry to be granted entry.

British holidaymakers should check their passport has at least six months on it before travel

Worryingly, 35 per cent of passport holders are unaware of these new passport requirements, according to new research from Compare the Market.

Of those whose passports are within date, 29 per cent were due to expire in less than a year, while 11 per cent did not know how long they had until their passport expired.

Its survey also found that 26 per cent of those who checked their passport validity, found they needed to update it because of the new requirements.

Those with outdated passports who are looking to travel this summer may already be out of luck.

The standard service for passport renewal currently takes around ten weeks and costs £75.50 or £85 if using a paper form.

There are fast-track options which can get you a passport in as little as two days, but these can cost more than double the standard fee.

Holidaymakers should also check their European Health Insurance Cards (EHICs). Whilst they are valid until their expiry date, after that individuals must apply for a new Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) under the new rules.

Both cards give travellers the right to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another EU country. The GHIC is free and can be applied for via the NHS.

The Compare the Market survey showed that 57 per cent of UK adults were unaware of this new rule, whilst 69 per cent are unsure when their EHIC expired, which could lead to problems if they fell ill while abroad.

Travellers should check how long is left on their EHIC in case they need to apply for a GHIC

Leaving the EU has also changed the requirements for driving abroad. At present, drivers taking their own cars to the continent now need a GB sticker unless their number plate has a GB on it.

As of 28 September, the GB sticker will need to be changed to a UK one. All drivers will need a sticker to drive abroad, even if they have GB on their number plate.

Another change for travellers to be aware of is mobile phone charges.

As a result of Brexit, phone companies are no longer legally bound to offer 'roam like at home' fees, which used to mean that people from the UK could use their phones abroad at no extra cost.

Some 77 per cent of people surveyed had not checked whether their mobile provider has introduced roaming charges – which could see significant costs rack up.

Whilst mobile providers now reserve the right to introduce roaming charges, the majority of networks have made commitments not to.

However, EE has said it will charge those joining the network, or customers upgrading their plan from 7 July 2021, £2 a day to use their allowances in 47 European destinations from January 2022.

After the end of September, drivers will need to replace GB stickers with a new UK alternative

Brexit also means that pet owners can no longer use pet passports issued in the UK to take cats and dogs to an EU country, and will instead need an animal health certificate (AHC).

However, 56 per cent of pet owners are not aware that these rules have changed.

To get an AHC, pet owners must take their pet to the vet and will need to do this no more than 10 days before travelling.

Aside from an AHC, customers will also need a microchip, a valid rabies vaccination and a tapeworm treatment for dogs if travelling directly to Finland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta.

Chris King, head of travel insurance at Compare the Market, said: 'For most holidaymakers planning a trip abroad this year, it will be their first since the Brexit transition period ended on 31 December 2020.

'With new rules and constantly changing restrictions due to the pandemic, research is key.

'It is sensible to take out travel insurance before going to Europe or further afield, to make sure you are covered for medical treatment you may need, since this can be extremely costly.

'As well as medical cover, travel insurance can cover lost or stolen luggage and cancellation costs should you not be able to go on holiday in some circumstances.

'We also strongly advise holidaymakers to be vigilant. Even though the Government has created a traffic light system, your holiday destination will likely have its own Covid rules and restrictions in place.

'This could include quarantine, Covid-19 testing, and additional paperwork, so you must check a country's requirements and whether you are prepared to take on these added checks.'

Travellers are advised to check the latest information on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office website.

The study was based on 2,000 UK consumers and was conducted in May this year.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Winchester is the most expensive city in Britain to buy a home, with an average property price tag of £630,432, an astonishing 14 times higher than average local pay packets, new findings have revealed.

While there has been considerable talk about a mass exodus from urban hubs during the pandemic, some remain as popular as ever - and in many, prices have risen sharply.

The average cost of a city home has swelled by 10.3 per cent to £287,440 in the past year, while the average earnings of people living in them climbed by just 2.1 per cent, mortgage lender Halifax said in a report.

Costly: Winchester is the most expensive city in Britain to buy a home, with property price tags 14 times higher than local people's pay packets

London was outside the top five least affordable cities for the first time in six years.

With its impressive cathedral and quaint river mill, Winchester replaced Oxford as the most unaffordable city to snap up a property when average local earnings were taken into account.

Any prospective buyers looking for a home in Winchester can expect to pay around £630,432, which is 8 per cent more than last year, according to Halifax.

Across the country, the affordability of cities has deteriorated. Last year, house prices in cities typically cost around seven-and-a-half times wages.

There are, however, some more affordable options for buyers wanting a slice of urban life for a fraction of the price.

Londonderry in Northern Ireland held its position as the most affordable city for the third consecutive year, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 4.7. There, a property costs around £155,917.

Housing affordability improved in seven cities compared with a year earlier, namely Oxford, Carlisle, Portsmouth, Durham, Salford, Inverness and Glasgow.

Carlisle and Aberdeen are now more affordable than five years ago, with their house price-to-earnings ratios easing, Halifax said.

Inverness is the only city found to be more affordable than 10 years ago. An average home there costs 5.6 times average earnings, down from 6.2 in 2011, due to wage growth outstripping house price growth.

All of the most affordable cities have house prices below the average for all UK cities (£287,440), expect for Hereford, where property prices are around £316,929.

Halifax said: 'Despite Hereford being the most expensive location in the top 20, affordability there is boosted by average earnings of £48,048, almost £10,000 above the UK average.'

London is now outside the least affordable cities for the first time in six years, yet affordability in the capital has not improved. Average property prices rose by 5 per cent to £564,695 in Greater London, while earnings grew by 4 per cent, pushing London's price to earnings ratio up to 11, up from 10.9 last year.

Russell Galley, managing director, Halifax, said: 'Affordability is significantly better in the north and there are now just two cities – Plymouth and Portsmouth – with better than average affordability in the south.'

Summing up all its findings, Halifax said the average property price tag to earnings ratio in cities was 8.1. It has been increasing for the past eight years, and stood at 5.6 between 2011 and 2013.

Wages in cities are often higher than in rural areas, and during the pandemic a high number of city dwellers have relocated to the countryside, helping to push up house prices in many greener areas.

Across all parts of the country, the house price-to-earnings ratio is 8.5, with property prices at an average of £327,691.

The FTSE 250-listed defence group this month became a takeover target for two US firms.

Aerospace giant Parker-Hannifin put forward a £6.3billion, 800p-per-share bid earlier this month.

FTSE 250-listed defence group Meggitt this month became a takeover target for two US firms

But on Wednesday it was trumped by rival aerospace engineer Transdigm, which barged in on the pre-agreed deal by putting forward an informal offer of 900p per share, worth £7billion.

Transdigm boasts of having a private-equity-style model, which has raised alarm bells in the City about the long-term future for technology and staff.

Independent aerospace and defence analyst Howard Wheeldon said what was important with a buyout is how much a new owner is willing to invest in a firm.

He said: ‘Meggitt is certainly a great company and one that has many long-term strengths.

‘It deserves far better than being ultimately taken over by a company such as Transdigm that is happy to boast it has a private-equity-like structure and culture.

Parker-Hannifin has a culture and forward-looking investment approach very similar to that of Meggitt.’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There could be a mobile price cap put into place in the future, a telecom expert believes, due to the rising cost of phone contracts.

Price is the most important factor for consumers when choosing a provider, according to research from Telness Technologies, a cloud technology company, which is why a cap could potentially be implemented.

Martina Klingvall Holmström, co-founder of Telness Technologies, believes a cap - similar to the energy price cap introduced by the Government - could be good for the industry.

She said: 'A cap is pretty likely to happen and I think it could be good for the market. We need differentiation in the industry and a cap will enhance the market meaning operators can offer customers different things and give consumers more choice.'

A telecoms expert believes that a smartphone price cap could be put in place in the future

What would a cap entail?

If a cap was introduced, it could be implemented in a number of ways, according to Martina.

One suggestion is to put an upper limit in place with consumers not able to pay more than a certain amount a month. The cap would likely affect the airtime and data element of a contract, rather than the cost of the phone itself.

This is due to mobile phone access now becoming a necessity, as opposed to a luxury, with people needing access to one to live and work.

As a result of rising handset prices, prices for mobile phone contracts can even be around £60 or £70 a month for newer models. But while the phones themselves drive prices up, so too does the usage in terms of airtime and data, in particular.

Alternatively, there could be a minimum price put in place in order to ensure vital infrastructure works can be afforded by operators.

Martina said: 'Another suggestion would be to put a cap in place for minimum pricing instead to help operators support an infrastructure for customers.

'At the moment, operators are so similar. There is a constant price wars with costs for consumers too low to support the building of new infrastructure.

'In this scenario, a cap could focus less on price and instead force operators to be more innovative and different to other providers.'

Maintaining and improving infrastructure is very important to the mobile industry but it can be costly.

For example, the 5G rollout that is ongoing in the UK is currently only available in certain towns and cities. But with more infrastructure in place, the more widely available it will become.

Whilst a minimum cap is likely to be shocking to consumers, it could help them in the long term as it would give them more advanced options in the future, according to Martina.

Why is a cap needed?

Ultimately, telecoms is a necessity, like energy, Martina says, as the user needs it in their daily lives and businesses.

Therefore, like energy, it could benefit from a cap, to stop rising prices getting out of hand.

One reason she believes a cap would be beneficial for the industry is because 'mobile services all selling the same sort of products', for example, similar contracts for similar phones.

This means differentiators are hard to come by and, as a result, price is the real battleground.

Martina said about the potential cap: 'Telephone firms are pretty much the same with similar offerings. Therefore, pricing becomes very important.'

As such, instead of rising prices to create competition, having a cap in place will create actual differentiation between providers.

Martina Klingvall Holmström, co-founder of Telness Technologies, believes a mobile cap could be good

Martina says as an example: 'Before the roaming cap, there was one network that said their customers didn't have to pay extra to use their plan abroad. But as a result, other providers started to do this.'

She said once the roaming cap was in place, providers could put other deals on to separate themselves from their rivals, creating more competition.

Another reason to impose a cap is due to the ever growing need for mobile phones and on-the-go internet access.

'Working from home is a major drive to have a cap. Ten years ago, you didn't have to have a phone but now we can't survive without one.

'Due to Covid and the lockdowns, consumers have to do much more online. You have to work from home and use more data. It is a completely different environment to a decade ago – instead of having a phone for fun, it is now a necessity.'

She believes another of the main problems in the industry is the lack of customer satisfaction.

'I would like to see the customer experience being appreciated in order to build up trust and satisfaction within the area.

'There is a customer service baseline with other industries but not in telecoms. It is so important to so many people. Networks need to gain trust and gain good customer experiences.'

Ofcom said as mobile usage has gone up over the years, prices have actually gone down

How realistic is the idea of a cap?

Whilst a cap might seem like a far fetched idea to some, Martina uses the example of data roaming again, to highlight the likelihood of it happening.

Previously, travellers from the UK were able to use their mobile data, minutes and texts within the EU without incurring extra charges, after firms were banned from charging customers extra fees.

After Brexit, this was scrapped and firms have started charging again.

However, Martina says this highlights that it is not a big leap to suggest that caps on your phone bill would be introduced.

'It wouldn't be something that would be very new.'

Despite this, industry regulator, Ofcom, said the price of mobiles has actually gone down as usage has increased.

This suggests the market has already become more competitive over the years - and potentially a cap would not be needed.

It added mobile customers typically pay a lower price if they take a Sim-only deal.

However, at the same time, its latest Pricing Trends report also found that some operators’ prices rose for new, and many existing, customers in 2021.

For example, BT/EE increased prices by 3.9 per cent from March 2021 across landline, broadband, TV, BT Sport and mobile, Three introduced price increases of 4.5 per cent, to be applied each April, and Vodafone has introduced price rises of 3.9 per cent, again to be applied each April.

As more people work from home, they will rely on their smartphones and internet access more

How would this affect the market?

Martina believes there would be more competition in the market if introduced.

She said: 'If caps were announced tomorrow say, you'd have big operators jumping in in an effort to try and attract customers away from rivals, creating an even bigger price war and potentially leading to smaller ones going out of business.'

However, there is a risk that a cap may backfire and 'kill off different segments of the industry', according to Martina.

She said: 'Whilst some firms are too big to fail, they would probably be happy about price caps as it might actually end up making it harder for smaller companies to compete.'

For example, if a cap is set too high, other, smaller firms may not be able to compete and will have to exit the market.

She said: 'However, some of the smaller, more agile networks might be able to respond faster as they're not weighed down by high IT costs.'

Meanwhile, caps often see pricing cluster near the or at the top of the permitted level.

She added that it will also depend on how fast different operators can adapt – if they can at all.

Many larger firms have infrastructure and high costs to keep up with but as they are giants in the industry and have huge existing customer bases, they will likely be able to adapt reasonably well.

Overall, Martina believes a cap would be good for the industry.

She said: 'I actually think a cap could be good. Whilst it depends on the type of cap, it could lead to a more competitive and innovative space.'

What is in place to help customers manage bills?

At present, if someone switches providers, renews their contract or enters into a new contract with their current provider, they can request a bill limit which will be included in their contract.

Those who are in contract can ask their supplier to apply one but they have no obligation to do so.

Most will send texts to customers who are nearing the end of their data, minutes or text usage.

If you feel like you need help with your bills, speak to your provider and see if they can help you set up a limit or a payment plan.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former Yo! Sushi chief executive Vanessa Hall has been drafted in as chairwoman at fast-growing leisure company Gravity Active.

Set up by two childhood friends, Gravity Active has drawn up plans to double in size to at least 30 locations.

This weekend, it opens its largest site in a former, giant Debenhams store inside a London shopping centre which includes bars, restaurants, a host of leisure pursuits and uses augmented reality to enhance traditional activities.

New start: Vanessa Hall is to chair fast-growing leisure firm Gravity Active

Hall has spent nearly 30 years working in leisure and hospitality including as a director at Bass, All Bar One and Mitchells & Butlers.

She said: 'We have an exciting expansion programme as people look for shared leisure experiences with friends and reconnections with colleagues.'

The arrival of the former restaurant boss comes as Gravity Active appoints KPMG to advise on fundraising for the company's next phase of growth.

Harvey Jenkinson, co-founder and chief executive at Gravity, said the company could raise around £10million by early next year, but plans are still to be finalised.

Gravity's centres first opened as trampoline parks but have grown rapidly to include climbing walls, indoor golf, go-karting, bowling alleys, e-sports and new interpretations of pub games such as digital darts and pool.

The company has its eye on ten sites in Saudi Arabia and in October opens its first mainland Europe site, in the German city of Leipzig.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's most popular retail destinations are enjoying a stellar summer thanks to families who scrapped foreign holiday plans.

The trend for staycations has seen visitor numbers at some shopping centres nearing 2019 levels, bosses said.

Bruce Findlay, retail director at property giant and Bluewater owner Landsec, said the performance of stores within the centres has been further boosted by what he called 'committed shoppers' who have returned with a vengeance after a year and a half of interrupted openings.

Stellar sales: The trend for staycations has seen visitor numbers at some shopping centres nearing 2019 levels

He said the White Rose Centre in Leeds had seen visitor numbers rise to 'within 10 per cent' of 2019 levels, giving retailers renewed hope.

Shocking footfall figures for July, from analysts Springboard, had shown visitor numbers across the retail sector down 24 per cent compared with the same month in 2019.

But Findlay's best performing centres – including St David's in Cardiff, Gunwharf Quays in Portsmouth and Trinity in Leeds – have had a strong August.

He said: 'Now the holiday is on, families are coming for a day out again. We've started seeing dedicated shoppers arriving with a real purpose.'

And shoppers arriving to spend, not browse, means sales at some stores are outpacing footfall indicators.

Findlay said the return of university students next month to cities such as Leeds and Manchester would help. But he warned: 'The big unknown is the autumn and the lead-up to Christmas.

'A lot of brands have taken significant steps to prepare for September but others are waiting to see what'll happen. They are saying 'I can't guarantee we'll be open and trading.' It's obviously a very nervous situation for some retailers.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Almost all of Britain's bosses are grappling with the working from home dilemma: how often should staff come to the office?

Since the Government introduced lockdowns in March 2020, at least a quarter of the workforce – more than eight million people – have been working from home.

Many are strongly in favour of continuing this giant, national experiment because they avoid commuting.

Britons have saved at least £50billion in fares and other costs of getting to and from work.

Benefit?: Some research suggests that working from home has boosted productivity, thanks to less wasted time commuting

If workers once again have to travel to the office every weekday, then the commuting costs will feel like a pay cut.

But bosses know that an organisation's culture is essential to its success. Some research suggests that working from home has boosted productivity, thanks to less wasted time commuting.

But the long-term damage to staff motivation and morale in a Zoom universe is hard to gauge.

The risk is that we have reached a historic turning point and, in my view, we are sleepwalking into a decision made more for the sake of cost and convenience than the long-term health of business and the economy.

We are about to lose sight of all the benefits of having groups of people working in close proximity. If we continue, we may not find out the worst of the impact for years – by which time, this flirtation with home working might begin to look like a mis-step.

Most entrepreneurs I know desperately want most of their people in the office most of the time. They know that video conferencing is a poor substitute for face-toface meetings.

Nuance, humour, non-verbal communication and humanity are all lost on a digital screen. I try to do all meetings that matter in person – interviews, key pitches, important discussions.

Creativity and inspiration are hard to generate remotely. Mostly I feel drained after a video meeting, whereas often a positive real meeting raises my spirits and energy levels.

I realise that some people are still fearful of crowded public transport. Moreover, business leaders are worried about litigation from staff who feel they have been bullied into returning to workplaces where they feel unsafe because of Covid.

But I have a suspicion that many who indicate support for lockdowns in surveys do so because they are worried they will have to return to the office full-time when restrictions end for good.

Remember, ten million workers had no choice throughout the pandemic – they had to leave home to do their job.

Refuse collectors, postal staff, courier drivers, construction workers, hospital staff, supermarket staff, factory workers and many others were never offered the choice of sheltering at home. They kept the lights on and the country running.

My observation is that large corporations are the most hesitant about asking their workers to come back to the office, with those in professional service firms, such as lawyers, accountants and bankers, the categories most likely to work from home throughout.

Worse, I suspect bosses are just plain scared of asking their highly-paid and cosseted workers back from their cosy new existences – which smacks a little of cowardice.

For senior and middle management, living settled lives in spacious homes with gardens, working from home is doubtless a pleasant alternative to the office.

But for younger, newer staff without established work connections, who should be keen to learn, and who probably live in less salubrious surroundings, working from home is likely to be much less fun.

For anyone ambitious starting out in their career, I have a single piece of advice – go to the office every day and be in the room.

You will be noticed and you will get ahead.

Now is a great opportunity to take advantage of the fact that some bosses have been hopeless at getting people back to the office – and some workers are too scared or lazy to make the trip.

A reckoning is coming this September after the summer holidays end.

Assuming the pandemic continues to recede, most managers will insist that employees attend their usual place of work two or three days a week as a minimum.

If workers refuse, they may find their job is outsourced to India.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investing in emerging markets is not for the faint-hearted, as recent sharp stock market falls in China have demonstrated.

But it can be hugely rewarding for investors who are prepared to be patient and play the long game.

No emerging market encapsulates this better than India. Over the past decade, the country's stock market index – the BSE Sensex – has tripled in value.

On the move: Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, with a fleet of electric rickshaws, is expanding in India

Yes, its upward trajectory has occasionally been rudely interrupted by big global events such as the 2008 financial crisis and more recently the pandemic, but it has been one of the emerging markets' stronger performers.

Yet there are experts – fund managers and investment advisers – who believe the Indian investment party has only just begun.

They predict another decade of solid investment returns from Indian equities – on the back of a booming economy, a young workforce and greater international investment in the country (in part triggered by big multinational businesses wishing to reduce their dependency on an increasingly belligerent China).

Brian Dennehy, managing director of investment scrutineer FundExpert, has been recommending India to clients since 2008.

Indeed, the stock market remains his top investment recommendation for the coming decade.

He says: 'A young population and a reform minded government headed by Narendra Modi can power the Indian economy for many years and decades to come.'

The latest global economic outlook report from the International Monetary Fund backs Dennehy's view. It believes India will lead the world's economic recovery this year and next.

Although the Indian economy shrank last year by more than five per cent as a result of the pandemic, the IMF says it is on course to rebound strongly – growing by 9.5 per cent this year and 8.5 per cent in 2022.

No other economy, it forecasts, will grow by as much – not even China where the IMF says the respective growth figures will be 8.1 per cent and 5.7 per cent.

David Cornell is chief investment officer of London based Ocean Dial Asset Management which runs India Capital Growth, a £127million trust listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Over the past ten years, the fund has generated shareholder returns of 151 per cent from a portfolio of between 30 and 35 stocks.

He describes India as a 'compelling investment story' as a result of a number of inter-connected factors – none more important than prime minister Modi's determination to free up the economy.

Modi, says Cornell, is leading the way, driving through a series of reforms aimed at removing the bureaucracy which previously inhibited many businesses and discouraged competition.

The PM has also simplified and reduced business taxes while signalling a big increase in infrastructure spending.

The economy, he adds, will also get a boost from the trend which has seen a shift of manufacturing from China to India. 'Foreign investment in India is increasing all the time,' he says.

'Mobile phone giant Apple has said it plans to shift a fifth of its production capacity from China to India.

'Similarly, Samsung is looking to expand its operations at its Noida factory in Uttar Pradesh. Amazon and packaging company Procon Packaging are also investing in India.'

As well as concerns over China's geo-political intentions, low wage costs – a third of those in China – are helping drive this investment in India.

It's a point made by Ramesh Mantri, senior analyst at White Oak Capital Management, a boutique investment house specialising in Indian equities and manager of fund Ashoka India Equity.

He says: 'Anti Chinese sentiment is spreading across Asia and the world is waking up to the fact that it is too reliant on China as a manufacturer of goods. It now sees India as a perfect alternative, a large country with a low cost labour force.'

The composition of India's economy is slowly changing, moving from its dependency on industries such as oil and gas, coal and commodities to embrace new technology – a shift given impetus by the pandemic and the need for the country to digitalise. This is seen as a positive for the equity market.

'India doesn't have well-established, stock market listed technology companies to match those in China such as Tencent and Alibaba,' says Cornell. 'But a new economy is slowly emerging.'

He points to last month's listing of food delivery company Zomato as evidence of investor appetite for technology focused businesses.

A wave of other private companies with a digital bent, among them logistics company Delhivery and online eyewear business Lenskart, are also looking to go public.

A young population – 50 per cent of India's 1.3billion people are aged under 25 – with money to spend will help spur economic growth.

Dzmitry Lipski, head of fund research at wealth manager Interactive Investor, believes the country's young and well educated population is its 'biggest asset'.

He adds: 'India's middle class is expected to grow from around 50million today to 475 million by 2030.

As they move to the cities, their lifestyles will evolve and their aspirations will grow, This in turn will drive consumer spending and generate economic growth.'

Mantri believes the Indian equity market is a dream for stock-picking fund managers.

This is because of its size – there are more than 5,000 listed companies – the diversity of its constituents, and the fact that some companies are poorly researched.

This provides the opportunity to unearth companies that are seriously undervalued. The fund's 65- strong portfolio is correspondingly skewed towards small and mid cap companies where share price inefficiencies are more prevalent.

Over the past three years, the investment trust has generated a return of 66 per cent.

With India's BSE Sensex stock market having enjoyed a good past year (up more than 50 per cent), it could be argued that a lot of good news is already priced into share prices.

It's a point Ocean Dial's Cornell concedes. 'Yes, the market has priced in a sustained economy recovery – and of course that could be stalled if Covid returns with a vengeance,' he says.

'But if you are prepared to take a five to seven-year investment view, and are happy to endure a few bumps along the way, India could be the place to invest a slice of your investment portfolio.'

Ultra, which supplies cutting-edge submarine-hunting technology to the Royal Navy, is being taken over by US-owned Cobham, which said it has agreed to a £2.57billion deal to buy the London-listed firm.

Meanwhile, Coventry-based Meggitt, which makes parts for planes and military aircraft including 'black boxes' for the RAF's Typhoon jets, reconfirmed its plans to accept a £6.3billion bid from US business Parker-Hannifin.

British defence sell-off: Ultra Electronics and Meggitt are set to be taken over by US firms

It also said the stock market's Takeover Panel will set a deadline on another rival bidder, TransDigm to make its own £7billion bid binding.

Transdigm had proposed buying Meggitt for 900p per share, which outweighs the 800p bid from Parker Hannifin. Shares in Meggitt were down 0.2 per cent to 817p just after London stock market close on Monday.

Meggitt shareholders will be asked to vote on Parker Hannifin proposed takeover on September 17 but this could be delayed if TransDigm makes its own bid binding.

This wave of bids for key UK defence assets has seen the Government coming under pressure to step in to block the deals on national security grounds.

Only last week, another key defence business was sold off as Babcock International offloaded its Frazer-Nash Consultancy that does work on nuclear submarines and weaponry for Royal Navy warships to American aerospace group KBR for nearly £300million.

Cobham, which is owned by US private equity firm Advent, said it recognised 'the specific importance of Ultra's contribution to the UK's economy and national security'.

And it pledged to engage with the UK government to agree the detailed terms, duration, nature and form of its binding commitments, which would apply immediately after the closing of the deal to protect Ultra's businesses and stakeholders.

Cobham added it would protect existing jobs and invest in research and development to create new ones in UK manufacturing and engineering positions.

London-based Ultra would also keep its headquarters in the UK, it added, and the Government will have an 'ongoing dialogue, co-operation and monitoring' position to ensure the commitments are upheld.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is said to have ordered officials to launch a national security investigation under the Enterprise Act.

The Act gives the Government the power to intervene in mergers on public interest grounds covering national security.

Ultra-Cobham deal: Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is said to have ordered officials to launch a national security investigation under the Enterprise Act

Shareholders in Ultra will get £35 a share and a 16.2p-a-share dividend under the deal, which was first announced in late July.

Ultra shares were up 4.8 per cent to £33.12 just after London stock market close on Monday.

The board will now ask shareholders to vote on the deal and must secure the support of 75 per cent.

Shonnel Malani, chairman of the Cobham Group, said: 'We believe Cobham and Ultra's complementary capabilities delivering mission critical technology will be significantly enhanced through the combination of the two groups, enabling the development of higher performance solutions for our customers.'

He added: 'We look forward to working with HM Government, and other relevant stakeholders, to agree legally binding commitments which safeguard Ultra's contribution to the UK economy and national security.'

Tony Rice, chairman of Ultra, said: 'The Ultra board has... spent considerable time reviewing the potential impact of Cobham's ownership on Ultra's stakeholders and is comfortable that their stakeholder commitments plus legally binding undertakings to HM Government will protect stakeholder interests appropriately.

'The Ultra board therefore unanimously intends to recommend the Cobham offer to shareholders.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I havea confession to make – please don't hold it against me. I love some of the BBC's current output on Radio Four and television.

I can't get enough of The Archers (I hope alcoholic Alice Carter hasn't done anything silly after going awol), love Celebrity MasterChef (isn't Su Pollard delightfully quirky), and found the second series of crime drama Baptiste utterly absorbing (Fiona Shaw is yet again a revelation).

Yet it doesn't mean I am happy with all things BBC. Far from it. Some of its new 'comedy' programmes on Radio Four make for uncomfortable listening, are not fit for purpose, and frankly should not be aired.

Sign of the times: There is an air of arrogance within the BBC – plus a worrying overload of wokeism

And although I am a long-time listener of the Today programme, its continued aggressive interviewing of guests has made me question whether my regular early morning dalliance with it should be suspended indefinitely.

There is also an air of arrogance within the BBC – plus a worrying overload of wokeism – that I find appalling.

It seems I am not alone in my criticisms. Here, at The Mail on Sunday, we pride ourselves on providing a mouthpiece for readers who are outraged about the actions of a particular company or organisation – or, for that matter, regulator or Government.

Occasionally, we receive a torrent of emails and letters so overwhelming that we have a duty to take heed.

As my colleague Toby Walne reports, such a situation has now arisen with the BBC.

In a nutshell, readers are outraged about the tactics TV Licensing – the payment collection arm of the BBC – is employing to ensure that pensioners over the age of 75 now pay for a TV licence.

This follows the Corporation's controversial decision last August to scrap free licences for four million pensioners aged over 75 (those on low incomes will still no longer have to pay provided they are in receipt of Pension Credit).

Having encouraged pensioners to pay up with gentle reminders, TV Licensing is now ramping up the pressure on the remaining 260,000.

These tactics are unacceptable. It has sent out some letters warning pensioners that they will be visited by an enforcement officer if they do not play ball. 'Our officers visit an address every six seconds. Day. Evening. Even weekends. And if no one answers, they can come back,' the letters say.

It is Orwellian behaviour.

Of course, the BBC was wrong to have removed the right of a free licence for all pensioners over the age of 75.

Although that wrong cannot now be righted, it doesn't mean that the voices of those pensioners who are angry about the BBC's move should not be heard.

Hence our decision to give them a platform to air their opinions, today and last week.

We would also never recommend that readers should refuse to pay for a TV licence because ultimately they will be taken to court and could end up in prison.

But, again, we will report the views of those who remain determined not to pay – and expose the unacceptable tactics the BBC is using via TV Licensing to intimidate them into paying.

You would have thought that a BBC whose motto is 'nation shall speak peace unto nation' would understand this.

But it doesn't. Instead of listening to those who feel aggrieved about the loss of their free TV licence – and accepting that the use of payment enforcement officers is a step too far – it has spent the past seven days in self-denial.

It has attempted to persuade the MoS that its enforcement officers are not being sent out to 'enforce' payment, but to provide some form of customer care. Baloney.

For those pensioners who feel aggrieved over the loss of their free TV licence, they should look at their humble goggle-box sitting in the corner of their living room and ask themselves two simple questions.

One: 'Do I still really need to watch the BBC and live TV on other channels?'

Two: 'Can I live without BBC's online iPlayer service?'

Although there were rumors the post was a dig at Megan, Lala told Access: 'I am not very subtle when I shade people. If I was upset I would have just straight up said it.'

Bruce and Kelly did not attend the premiere either and Kelly was noticeably quiet on his social media about the project.

The day after its release he cryptically tweeted: 'if i don’t talk or tweet about a movie i’m barely in it’s because it’s [trash emoji].'

There they are: She met her beau Machine Gun Kelly on the Puerto Rico set of the film Midnight In The Switchgrass (pictured) which was finally released late last month

Emile posted a screenshot of Kelly's tweet to Instagram and wrote: 'We definitely disagree here, Colson! Nothing but respect to you guys though - especially because you and Megan are so f***ing great in this movie.'

Megan recently revealed to Who What Wear that the film 'was definitely a vehicle - I’ll be honest - for me to meet Colson.'

She dished: 'I knew he was gonna be in the movie, but the universe was just like: "Go do this. There’s something about this experience that’ll be really rewarding for you."'

Megan shares three children - Noah, eight, Bodhi, seven, and Journey, five - with her estranged husband Brian Austin Green whom she is in the process of divorcing.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tony Hetherington is Financial Mail on Sunday's ace investigator, fighting readers corners, revealing the truth that lies behind closed doors and winning victories for those who have been left out-of-pocket. Find out how to contact him below.

R.M. writes: I am a 73-year-old pensioner and purchased one-ounce gold coins from The Royal Mint for my grandchildren. The total cost was £11,000. The Royal Mint said the coins would be delivered by a specialist courier and had to be signed for.

When they did not arrive, I contacted The Royal Mint and some time later a courier came to my door and tried to get me to sign for the coins I never received. When I refused, the courier said he would go to the police, so I told him to do so.

The Royal Mint itself said it would not accept a claim from me unless I filed a crime report, but the police say they cannot accept a report from me without evidence a crime has been committed.

Gift: Coins, worth £11,000, were bought for grandchildren from The Royal Mint

Tony Hetherington replies: You were caught between The Royal Mint and a hard place. How can you prove a crime has been committed?

On the face of it, a failure to supply the gold coins you ordered is a breach of contract, not a crime. So with The Royal Mint insisting it did supply the coins, you have been left going round in circles.

According to The Royal Mint, the gold coins were sent in a package to be delivered by courier company UPS.

But because of Covid, UPS says it has stopped getting signatures when it makes deliveries. So does this mean the package containing £11,000 in gold might simply have been dumped on your doorstep?

UPS refused to say. Did someone from UPS demand that you sign for the delivery days later? Again, UPS refused to say. All it would tell me was this: 'We have contacted and are working with the police as they investigate this shipment.'

At least this does mean that although the police would not deal with you, it has accepted a report from UPS, presumably because UPS does not deny it did have the gold coins and was responsible for their safe delivery.

So where does this leave The Royal Mint? I asked staff there whether UPS was aware the package was very valuable. I asked whether UPS was instructed to get a delivery signature.

I enquired whether The Royal Mint staff were aware that UPS itself was unlikely to get a signature and might leave the package on your doorstep.

And I wondered whether gold coins despatched to customers were insured en route.

The Royal Mint told me the coins were in 'discreet packaging', which fails to say explicitly whether UPS knew the contents.

Was UPS told to get a signature? The Royal Mint simply pointed me towards UPS's own website, saying it had ceased demanding signatures.

Lost?: Due to Covid, UPS says it has stopped getting signatures when it makes deliveries

Could £11,000 in gold have been left on your doorstep? The Royal Mint refused to say, except to tell me: 'We have strict criteria in place for our delivery partners to ensure safe delivery of our products.'

And how about insurance? The Royal Mint said: 'We have all relevant protection in place to provide customers with peace of mind.' Well this was an epic failure, wasn't it!

I let The Royal Mint know that its answers were cop-outs and not answers at all.

Finally, last Thursday, I was told: 'Yes, we have all the relevant insurances for deliveries.' And best of all, after playing a dead bat for days and days, The Royal Mint told me it was contacting you to say it would replace all the missing coins.

I resisted the temptation to ask whether another £11,000 in gold would be sent via UPS, but please let me know when the coins arrive – and whether you are asked to sign for them this time.

Drip feed: Two pensioners have lost £510 due to the incompetence of Southern Water

Why should we pay £510 for Southern Water's mistake?

J.B. writes: We hope you can come to the rescue of two pensioners who have lost £510 due to the incompetence of Southern Water.

It told us excess water was passing through our meter, probably due to a leak – and listened along the route of the pipe and said the leak was probably under our house.

We then employed an outside company to pinpoint the leak and it found that it was not under our house, but outside our property line.

Later, Southern Water dug up the pavement to carry out repairs, but it has failed to respond to repeated requests to pay the £510 charged by the outside company that traced its leak.

Tony Hetherington replies: I asked Southern Water whether its own engineers had wrongly pinpointed the leak, and if so, why you should be expected to pay for its mistake. A few days later, the water company called you to say that payment of the full £510 was on its way.

Southern Water told me: 'We have apologised to Mr B. We wrongly identified this as a leak on his property.' Southern Water has also reduced your water bill to make up for any of the leakage charged to you.

Cruise refund is proving tricky

M.P. writes: We are having problems obtaining a refund of £4,300 that was paid for a holiday with Cruise & Maritime Voyages.

The trip was cancelled by the cruise company, which advised us to claim a refund, but the travel agent told us to claim directly from the company, which by then had folded.

We tried to claim through the bank cards used for booking, but this failed too, so we applied to ABTA, which is where things stand.

Tony Hetherington replies: Like lots of travel customers, you have been sent from pillar to post during lockdowns. You booked through travel agents Althams, which explained it was in pretty much the same position as you.

All the money had gone to Cruise & Maritime, which had collapsed, so Althams was limited to helping with a claim to ABTA.

Its staff, in turn, have been no more protected from Covid than anyone else, so lots have been working from home, which is less efficient.

I asked your bank to comment, but before they could do so, ABTA pulled out all the stops and sent a full refund to your bank account, so it is a happy ending.

If you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing, write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Insurance group Admiral saw its earnings surge by 76 per cent in the first six months of this year, fresh figures have revealed.

In a boost for the group's shareholders, Admiral has also announced it will be dishing out a special dividend later this year.

The company grew its customer base by 850,000 in the period, taking its overall customer numbers to 8.02million.

Surge: Insurance group Admiral saw its earnings surge by 76% in the first six months of 2021

Admiral saw its profits come in at £482.2million in the first half, more than previous forecasts of between £400million and £450million.

The insurer has set its dividend at 115p a share, as the company sweetened a half year dividend of 87.9p with a special dividend of 27.1p, propelling its shares to new highs of around £35.36. Shareholders will receive their dividend payouts on 1 October.

Milena Mondini de Focatiis, the group's chief executive, said: 'A good strategy is a plus; good execution is a must, especially in times of disruption. It’s been a half year of good execution for Admiral. By and large, we’ve done the right things more often and a bit earlier than most.'

She added: 'This included adjusting pricing ahead of the market in the UK to reflect shifting pandemic-related claims trends and providing more self-service and digital options to our customers. These actions have rewarded us with double digit growth in policy numbers in the UK and in international insurance, whilst operating in very competitive markets.'

The group has benefited from lower levels of motor insurance claims during the pandemic, even after most lockdown restrictions were eased in the last few weeks.

In charge: Admiral's boss, Milena Mondini de Focatiis

Admiral said: 'In most markets, whilst road traffic levels have started to return towards more normal levels, this has been slower than expected as lockdown restrictions have persisted longer, resulting in continued lower claims frequency relative to pre-pandemic levels.

'The UK, in particular, saw a longer than expected lockdown in the first half of 2021, with claims frequency taking longer to recover. In contrast, the US has seen a more rapid return towards more normal levels.'

The group announced today that around 10,000 staff will each receive an award worth up to £1,800 based on the company's employee share scheme.

Ms Mondini de Focatiis said: 'I am delighted that we can once again pay a record dividend to our shareholders, including our staff who continued to work hard to provide great service to our customers. I would also like to thank all of our customers for their continued trust in us.'

Shares in FTSE 100-listed Admiral are up 1.54 per cent or 53.00p to 3,502.00p. A year ago the group's share price was 2,525.00p.

Danni Hewson, an analyst at AJ Bell, said Admiral's latest results made the group akin to 'the Rolls Royce of motor insurers.'

She added: 'Compared with its peers the growth in profit and customer numbers the company is chalking up is highly impressive.

'While the industry as a whole benefited from a period with fewer cars on the road, leading to fewer accidents and, in turn, fewer claims, Admiral seems to have managed the situation better than its rival insurers.

'Admiral has won over customers by offering flexibility, boosting its digital capability and paying out customer rebates in a timely fashion, helping to put it ahead of the pack in a highly competitive market.

'These qualities have been rewarded with a double-digit increase in customer numbers at a time when other UK motor insurers are struggling to eke out any growth here at all.

'Shareholders are being richly rewarded with record dividend payments and Admiral’s strong financial position gives it lots of options while it works out what route it wants to take next.

'The road ahead could be a little bumpier for Admiral as the artificially lower levels of traffic and collisions driven by Covid restrictions starts to unwind, however the company has clearly demonstrated its ability to steer the right course.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The rise of DIY investing has delivered a revolution in buying shares, investment trusts and funds - offering investors huge savings through online brokers.

It's easy to invest in a stocks and shares Isa, self invested personal pension, or standard trading account online and start putting your money to work, without the need for a stockbroker or financial adviser.

That means you can invest around the world from the comfort of your computer or smartphone, but picking the right DIY platform or app is crucial and the array of different options has left many investors scratching their heads.

We explain how to decide on a DIY investment platform to invest in the full range of options: from shares, funds and investment trusts, to ETFs and direct retail corporate bonds.

Check the table for the brief details and read our full round-up of each platform's features and who they could be good for below.

Why does an Isa or investing platform matter?

Not so long ago, investing typically required a stockbroker or financial adviser and the willingness to hand over a big chunk of commission.

Now armed with a computer - or just a phone - investors can use a DIY investing platform or online broker and the wealth of research at their fingertips to hopefully build their fortune.

The right Isa wrapper or investing account has the power to boost your investments, helping you to build a portfolio and limiting how your hard-won returns are eaten into by fees.

DIY investing platforms act as a place to buy, sell and hold all your investments and a tax-efficient wrapper around them if you choose to invest in an Isa.

When weighing up the right one for you, it's important to to look at the service that it offers, along with administration charges and dealing fees, plus any other extra costs.

We highlight Isa and non-Isa charges, but don't forget that investing in an Isa makes sense, as it should protect your hopefully growing investments from as much tax as possible.

We've busted the charges of what we consider some of the best (and cheapest) DIY investing platforms, including different fees for buying shares, funds, investment trusts and ETFs. We would advise doing your own research and considering the points below before you choose.

Investing can be as easy as picking up your phone and using it to buy or sell funds or shares - and that's far cheaper than when it involved calling your stock broker

Flat fee vs percentage charge DIY investing platform prices can be chiefly be split into two camps. Some charge a flat administration charge, while others charge a percentage of investors' holdings. The former tend to always charge for buying and selling investment funds, while the latter may bundle this cost in and offer free fund dealing. All charge for buying and selling shares, investment trusts and other products that are not funds, but the dealing fees vary from as low as £5 to about £12. If you are a buy and hold investor putting away a large sum of money then you may benefit from a flat fee rather than percentage-based charging, which can mount up to a hefty amount. But if you plan on buying and selling regularly watch our for dealing charges, as these can also add up substantially and easily erode the gain from a flat fee. Lower charges for regular monthly investing can substantially cut costs.

How we choose the best DIY investing platforms

We have focused on two vital aspects, cost and quality. This is not a collection of all of the absolute cheapest platforms, these are some we think stand out and that also compete keenly on price.

All discount initial fund charges down to zero in most cases. Some funds can still carry an initial charge though - platforms should provide you with a list to check.



We have picked DIY Isa platforms to suit different investors and focus on those that offer a choice of investments - not just funds. Each one will be better for some investors than others and you should choose depending on your needs. Remember there are plenty of others available too.

This list is in no particular order.

Hargreaves Lansdown is the big gun of DIY investing. The website is packed with information from its advisers and analysts, the shares and fund data is comprehensive and there is a very handy app.

Investors pay a 0.45 per cent fee on their total fund investments up to £250,000; 0.25 per cent to £1m, 0.1 per cent to £2m and nothing above that. Shares and investment trusts also incur a 0.45 per cent charge on the entire holding, capped at £45.

Hargreaves has negotiated some reduced annual management charges from fund managers.

Fund dealing is free. Share, investment trust, corporate bond and ETF dealing costs £11.95 per trade. If you trade more than 10 times per month share-dealing costs step down. Regular monthly share and some investment trust investing is £1.50, dividend reinvesting is 1 per cent, with a £1 minimum charge and £10 maximum.

Hargreaves has its very influential Wealth 50, a range of Master Portfolios, and its Portfolio+ service to make investing progressively easier and more hands off

Hargreaves Lansdown recently announced it would remove exit fees and cut a number of its costs.

Standard non-Isa dealing: Hargreaves' non-Isa Vantage account carries the same charges except for removing the fee for holding shares and trusts.

Who is it good for? Those looking for an advice-rich service that is price-competitive but not the cheapest around. It does come with lots of bells and whistles, including a very good app and portfolios for easy investing .

Our tests found Hargreaves platform easy and intuitive to use and its newly revised app is good.

It offers a proven popular service weighted towards funds but with access to investment trusts, ETFs, shares and the corporate bond market under one roof. [ More details on Hargeaves Lansdown ]

Interactive Investor

Interactive Investor has monthly fee plans, ranging from £9.99 to £19.99 per month.

There are three plans that can be chosen according to your investment style: Investor, charging £9.99 a month, Funds Fan charging £13.99 a month, and Super Investor charging £19.99 a month.

With each plan you get £7.99 of trading credit per month, with different charges to buy or sell applying. The trading credit lasts for 90 days.

In the Investor plan, trades in UK shares, funds and investment trusts and US shares are charged at £7.99 each.

For funds fan investors, the same costs apply but trades in funds and investment trusts are charged at £3.99 each.

In the Super Investor plan, trades in UK shares and funds and investment trusts are £3.99 each and £4.99 for US shares.

Trading in other international shares is £19.99 for the Investor and Funds Fan plans and £9.99 for the Super Investor plan. Dividend reinvestment is just 99p for all plans and regular investment is now free.

Sipp investors pay an extra £10 per month on all plans.

Who is it good for? Choose the standard option under Interactive Investor's charging structure and you will pay £119.88 per year and get back £95.88 in trading credits – but you must spend them within 90 days.

The cost of buying and selling UK investments at £7.99 isn't bad, although fund investing costs more than some rivals. Free regular investing is a winner.

In This is Money’s view, Interactive Investor’s charging plan makes it a top contender among investing platforms. Service is good and the fees are keen.

Interactive Investor is a good option for those with larger portfolios who would find percentage-based charges elsewhere mounting up. Someone with £100,000 in funds at Interactive Investor would pay £119.88 per year, or just £24 if they used all their trading credit. At Hargreaves Lansdown, with a 0.45 per cent annual fee, they would pay £450.

Our tests show II to be easy to use, with useful functions such as excel portfolio downloads, and an app that has improved greatly in recent times.

[More details on Interactive Investor]

Five things to consider when picking an investing platform 1. Cheapest is not always best: You need to think about a combination of price and service - it is worth paying for quality but make sure you are actually getting that. 2. What will you invest in: Different dealing fees for shares, investment trusts and funds mean you need to think about how you will invest and tailor your choice accordingly. 3. Tools and information: What level of useful portfolio building tools and information does a platform offer? 4. Overall charges: Don't just look at the admin fee or dealing charges. You need to combine both to get a true cost, along with costs such as dividend reinvestment and regular dealing charges. A low admin fee might look good but if you are an active investor who buys and sells a lot, then dealing charges will soon rack up and send costs soaring. 5. Extra fees: Check for regular monthly investing discounts, dividend reinvestment fees, transfer charges and other elements

Fidelity

Fidelity is one of the big investing names and has a platform packed with useful information, guides, market commentary and videos.

Share dealing has a flat £10 fee and this charge also applies to investment trusts and ETFs.

Holding investment funds carries a 0.35 per cent charge up to £250,000 and 0.20 per cent above that and 0 per cent above £1million.

However, if you are investing small amounts the charging structure is slightly different. Fidelity charges a flat £45 on amounts up to £7,500 before the 0.35 per cent rate kicks in.

There are no fund dealing charges for buying and selling.

Who is it good for? Fidelity offers very useful service. It is one of the big guns, has model portfolios, tools to help you decide how to invest and a wealth of information on offer.

Our tests found the main site easy to read and navigate, with lots of helpful information. [More details on Fidelity]

AJ Bell Youinvest has a 0.25 per cent annual administration charge.

Only one live Isa at a time Remember, you can only pay new money into one Isa wrapper each year, but you can keep an old tax year's Isa wrapper open (with no new payments into it) and open a new tax year one, or transfer all your holdings onto the same platform. Beware exit charges typically apply.

For non-fund holdings in Isas, such as investment trusts, shares and ETFs, this is capped at £3.50 per month. In a Sipp the cap is £10 per quarter.

For fund holdings it steps down to 0.1 per cent from £250,000 to £1million, 0.05 per cent to £2million and then nothing above that.

Fund dealing costs £1.50. Share, ETF and investment trust dealing is £9.95 - or £4.95 if you have traded ten times in the previous month.

Regular investing costs £1.50 into funds, FTSE 350 shares and a limited range of investment trusts.

Who is it good for? Youinvest scores with a low percentage admin charge that is also capped for shares, trusts and ETFs. It does have fund dealing charges, but at just £1.50 these are competitive.

There is cost effective regular monthly investing in funds, shares and selected investment trusts. There is no cheap dividend reinvestment.

Our tests show AJ Bell Youinvest to be simple to use and while it may not look as flashy as some rivals, it competes well on cost.

The Share Centre - Self-Select Isa

The Share Centre has been removed from this article after it was bought by Interactive Investor and no longer takes on new customers.

iWeb run by Halifax sharedealing offers a competitively priced service. Its stocks and shares Isa offers the chance to invest across shares, investment trusts, funds and ETFs, with a £100 one-off set-up charge but then no admin charge beyond that.

It costs just £5 to buy or sell funds, shares, investment trusts or ETFs. Dividend reinvestment is 2% with a £5 maximum charge.

Standard non-Isa dealing: Charges are the same

Who is it good for? iWeb is keenly priced for those looking to regularly buy investment trusts, shares or ETFs thanks to its low £5 dealing fee but the set-up fee of just £25 has now gone up to £100. Bear in mind that you do need to pay for fund-dealing here. [ More details on iWeb ]

Bestinvest Isa and standard investors pay annual charge of 0.40 per cent a year on their portfolios up to £250,000, and 0.2 per cent above that to £1million. No extra charges are added above £1m.

Bestinvest has no dealing charges for funds and standard share and investment trust dealing is decent value £7.50.

There are no reduced regular monthly investing charges for shares and trusts, nor is there cheap dividend reinvesting.

In an unusual step those who invest through a Sipp, as self invested personal pensions are known, see their charges cut to 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.

BestInvest offers a selection of model portfolio funds, rated in an investing risk-style.

Standard non-Isa dealing: Charges are the same.

Who is it good for? BestInvest is a good option for fund investors looking to take advantage of its research and lack of dealing charges.

Those buying shares, investment trusts and ETFs benefit from a £7.50 dealing fee, which is lower than most. The ready-made portfolios offer an easy hands-off route into investing at a reasonable cost.

It's also an interesting offer if you have a small Sipp and want to manage all your investments under one roof, as the Sipp charge is competitive. [More details on BestInvest].

The broker's online platform Charles Stanley Direct platform has a 0.35 per cent annual charge on fund holdings, above £250,000 of fund holdings charges begin to step down.

There is also a 0.25 per cent charge on investment trust or share holdings, with a minimum of £24 and maximum of £240 per year. This is removed monthly if you trade at least once in that month.

A Sipp costs £100 plus VAT per year but this fee is removed if you have more than £30,000 across all the broker's online platform services.

Fund dealing is free, but investment trust and share dealing will cost £11.50 and there is no regular investing option for this.

Investors holding individual bonds and overseas shares must pay £30 per year per holding.



Who is it good for? Active fund investors get a good deal at Charles Stanley with a low annual fee and no buying or selling charges. This is also a decent Sipp option for those with more than £30,000, who can then avoid the extra fee for pensions.

Those buying and holding investment trusts and shares can also do well if they trade each month and lose the platform fee, but that needs to be weighed up against £11.50 dealing charges adding up and the lack of a cut-price regular monthly investing option. [More details on Charles Stanley Direct]

...Or for cheap investing with less choice

US giant Vanguard has set up a UK investing platform but you can only buy its funds.

It is cheap with a 0.15% per year fee and has no costs for buying and selling. You can use this to buy Vanguard's simple and cheap passive funds, its active range, or its all in one LifeStrategy funds that invest in shares and bonds around the world.

Who is it good for? If you are looking for a simple and low cost investment platform, Vanguard is a good choice. You only get its funds but the firm's trackers and ETFs are among the best in the business - this is a particularly good option for those looking to start out with LifeStrategy funds.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's stock market is doing far better this year so far than last, but over the longer term has lagged behind its international rivals.

After the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote initially boosted UK share values, that effect has fizzled out and investors are now reluctant to back British companies.

But Tony Yarrow and Vincent Ropers, of Wise Funds, managers with a value and quality approach - who invest largely in investment trusts and also other funds for their portfolios - believe that when a Brexit solution is found that UK shares will bounce back.

They tell Simon Lambert how they go about choosing investments, why they prefer investment trusts and give their view on the Neil Woodford saga.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Brexit is delayed, companies are delaying investment and there is a consumer and property market slowdown being reported.

On the flipside, wages are rising, inflation is near the 2 per cent target and unemployment is low.

So, where do investors in UK shares stand? The UK stock market looks decent value but is there more bad news to come that will send shares down or an opportunity to share off the Brexit hangover?

On this episode of the Investing Show, we speak to Fidelity UK Opportunities manager Leigh Himsworth.

He says that while there has been a hiatus in company investment, the economic backdrop looks quite positive, with low unemployment and rising wages.

He adds: ‘With the market at the current level it’s actually quite an interesting point to invest in the UK.'

We ask where are the places to profit, where can investors shore against uncertainty and the risk of being hit and what are the companies he is currently backing and why?

Will the US stock market stumble or melt up?

US companies are reporting strong earnings and there has even been talk of a melt up, as shares take a final run up in the bull market.

Yet at the same time President Trump is worrying the world with his trade wars, Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter look at what may happen next.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Financial scams are on the rise. The coronavirus lockdowns have seen a fresh burst of investment cons with fraudsters impersonating legitimate companies to steal tens of thousands of pounds.

Unwitting savers are being lured into fake savings and investments, such as fixed term bonds or share schemes, and falling victim to clone fraud.

What’s behind this burst of crime and how can people protect themselves?

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost and Simon Lambert discuss the rising tide of fraud, how to stay safe and what more can be done to combat it.

Also, on the show, the pair look into the cases of the mortgage prisoners, trapped paying high rates ever since the financial crisis while others have seen their monthly payments slashed.

The Deliveroo float is also on the agenda – why did the shares slump as it hit the stock market?

And finally, campervans are in hot demand, making this a good time for VW to be launching its new mini Caddy California: with sleeping space for two and an optional tent that turns into a home on wheels for all the family. Would you want one?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@'Be greedy when others are fearful.' Warren Buffett's investment adage was tested this year and those who followed it would be quids in.

But as nations went into lockdown, economies nosedived and draconian measures surpassing most seen in living memory were introduced, it was hard for most investors to get up too much of an appetite, however many times they may have heard that line.

There seemed to be no way that markets would recover for some time and the most likely course was down.

Then the rebound came, but still it all looked to good to be true - as if it was just fools and their money being parted in a FOMO rally.

Except, it turned out to have legs. The world's dominant stock market, the US, has been on a tear since late March and many other countries have bounced back too.

So, has the opportunity to go bargain hunting passed? Could our own humble stock market be one of the last places left where you can do it? Are we missing a trick and ignoring the fact the world has changed and there is no point talking about cheap value investments, just get on the tech train?

On this week's podcast, Georgie Frost and Simon Lambert discuss investing bargains: what that means and whether there are any left?

Also, while the stock market has been on the rise, the economy has been taking another lockdown beating. Chancellor Rishi Sunak updated us this week on the state of the UK economy, so how bad was the news?

Also this week, NS&I and Marcus cut rates, so what can savers do now, and finally, is triple glazing worth splashing out on?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It’s been called the Fomo rally, as shares picked themselves up off the floor after a diabolical March and bear markets turned bullish.

The FTSE 100 closed a notch below 5,000 on 23 March, the day it was announced Britain was going into lockdown, but somehow managed to bounce 23 per cent to the middle of this week before slipping back.

In the US, April was even more astonishing – the S&P 500 had its best month since 1987.

So, what’s going on? Is this the stock market signalling the start of a coronavirus recovery, or have investors merely been piling in driven by Fomo – the fear of missing out?

The big US tech names’ star turn has helped drive confidence and in the UK it has been the big names hit hard that have rebounded over the past four weeks, including housebuilders, Next, Cineworld, ITV and the FTSE 100’s top riser is cruise ship firm Carnival – up 63 per cent as brave investors buy in.

But are investors getting ahead of themselves and simply all chasing in the same direction like kids with a football?

The Fomo rally: Shares in the UK and US have jumped since the end of March

On this week’s podcast, we look at the rally, what’s driving it – beyond Fomo – and the history of false dawns in stock market crashes, known as the dreaded dead cat bounce.

Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost also discuss how Britain gets back to business and how the plans might shape up for getting us back into factories, offices, shops, pubs, restaurants and everywhere else.

Plus, would you dare book a holiday now? If so, the podcast duo discuss what you need to consider.

And finally, the clock has have passed by quickly for a generation of cars that some of us grew up with and the Metro, Fiat Panda and early Vauxhall Astra are now 40 years old, tax exempt, and theoretically classic cars… but are they?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Few car firms have had a bigger impact than Elon Musk's Tesla. And with mainstream motor manufacturers now producing some decent electric car competition, there can be no denying the Californian company has shaken up the market.

I have just picked up the 'affordable' and attainable Tesla — a Model 3 Dual Motor Long Range All-Wheel Drive with a base price of £48,490, but costing £49,990 after the addition of £1,500 19in sports wheels.

Customer service was faultless — from the setting up of the drive to the hand-over. I was also sent some 'how to' video links to familiarise myself with the controls.

A delight to drive: Tesla's powerful Model 3 Dual Motor Long Range

The minimalist interior has no traditional dashboard and only a smart-pad-like screen in the middle of the dash. It is through this the car's functions are conducted.

Doing things differently and re-imagining the art of driving is all very well – but if you've spent decades mastering the 'traditional' car set-up you'll need time and patience to adapt. It's like mastering an Apple Mac after a lifetime on Windows PCs.

I know owners who are in seventh heaven with their Teslas – once they get totally familiar with it.

Its 82kWh battery promises a range of 360 miles. But part of Tesla's genius has been to set up a network of more than 750 superchargers in 84 locations across the UK.

I found the Model 3 a delight to drive with great presence and precise handling. And boy does it shift. My family saloon could accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 4.2 seconds, up to a top speed of 145mph.

The more powerful Performance AWD model (priced from £59,990) will cover 0-60mph in 3.1 seconds up to a top speed of 162mph and a range of 352 miles.

The entry level Standard Range Plus rear-wheel drive costs from £40,990 and covers 0-60mph in 5.3 seconds up to a top speed of 140mph with a range of 278 miles.

I tried 'Autopilot' mode — my hands lightly on the steering wheel as the car cornered by itself. But I'm not sure I'd let go at speed.

There was plenty of room for passengers in the back, plus storage in the front trunk.

However, the smart screen settings can be a faff. Yes, they're explained in the 'how to' videos. But you can't watch them when you're in traffic.

Plus the Tesla voice control responds only to U.S. English — they're still working on 'British English'.

On a motorway during a monsoon downpour I wanted to increase the speed of the windscreen wipers. Look left to the screen, search for icon, press icon, adjust setting On a motorway?

Forget it. Too distracting in the deluge. I thought I'd be clever and try voice control. I press the voice command button on the steering wheel and say: 'Wipers fast'. It switched the wipers off altogether.

Thankfully, pressing the one-wipe button on the left stalk kept it going long enough for me to pull in and sort safely (it also causes the wiper-adjust icon to pop up on the screen I belatedly discovered). But it was hairy.

My biggest criticism is the absence of a head-up display, which would overcome the distraction.

Despite the glitches, I really enjoyed the experience and would like to spend longer with a Tesla in the future.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investment fund managers are convinced that the UK stock market still provides opportunities for investors to make some serious long-term gains.

Although the market's bounce back over the past year from the shock of lockdown and economic disruption has been strong – the FTSE All-Share Index is up more than 24 per cent – investment experts believe there is more to come.

Among them is Richard Penny, manager of £110million fund Crux UK Special Situations.

He says that the UK stock market remains 'cheap' and could deliver annual double-digit returns over the next ten years.

'For a long time, the UK was on the naughty step,' he says, referring to Brexit. 'But the UK stock market is now a buyer's market.

'In valuation terms, the UK and European stock markets are cheap while US equities look expensive.'

It's a view shared by Dan Harlow, a fund manager at AXA Investment Managers.

He says the country's successful vaccination programme and lifting of most lockdown restrictions has created 'outstanding opportunities' in 'sold-off, domestic-facing sectors such as retailers and leisure companies'.

He adds: 'We are optimistic about the recovery for UK domestic names as the UK economy opens up.' Favourite holdings include Gym Group and Hollywood Bowl.

Penny's UK Special Situations fund is currently spread across 60 stocks, from all parts of the UK stock market – FTSE100 listed companies through to 'micro' stocks.

The result is an eclectic portfolio, but where the common theme is an opportunity that Penny sees to make money in the next two to five years, often stemming from management change.

At one end of the spectrum are stakes in household names such as insurer Aviva, mining giant Rio Tinto and hotel and restaurant giant Whitbread.

These are companies that Penny believes are mispriced in stock market terms and provide 'upside' over the coming months.

At the other end is a stake in a special-purpose acquisition company (spac) called Advanced ADVT, chaired by British businesswoman Vinodka Murria and set up to purchase private software companies.

Murria is best known for setting up software business Advanced Computer Software in 2008 and transforming it into a £750million company bought by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners in 2014.

Fund managers are convinced the UK stock market still provides opportunities for investors to make some serious long-term gains

'I've backed her business acumen before,' says Penny, 'and I like the fact that she has a personal financial interest in ensuring Advanced ADVT is a success.'

Penny is hoping shares in Advanced ADVT will increase in value once a suitable acquisition is made with the £130million of funds it has at its disposal.

Another key holding is infrastructure specialist Hill & Smith. Penny bought into the company six months ago at £14.50 a share and the shares are now trading at around £16.30.

'The company has benefited from new management brought in from manufacturing group Halma,' he says. 'It's become a core holding for us.'

Since launch in October 2018, the fund has generated profits for investors of 39 per cent.

Over the same period, the FTSE AllShare Index has increased in value by ten per cent.

Annual charges total 0.86 per cent and dividends are paid every six months, albeit on the low side at around one per cent a year. The stock market identification code is BG5Q5X2.

Crux Asset Management has £1.7billion of assets under management. Its flagship fund is the £850million Crux European Situations, managed by Richard Pease (ex Jupiter and New Star).
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It's natural to look at some of the big challenges in our society and want to help out.

Of course, this can be done by volunteering or giving to charity, but there is also another option: investing in social projects.

There is a rising number of investment opportunities to both help out and make a decent investment return. For example, investors can put their money into affordable housing, good healthcare and sustainable food projects.

As always, it's important that investors never put all their eggs in one basket, so social projects should form only a component of a balanced portfolio.

Helping hand: It's natural to look at some of the big challenges in our society and want to help

However, investments in social projects can make a good portfolio diversifier as their shares tend not to rise and fall in line with stock market volatility.

Investors can access social projects through funds and stock market-listed investment trusts.

By holding these funds in an Isa, they can protect their investments from tax. Alternatively, they can invest through an innovative finance Isa.

Investing via funds and investment trusts

There is a limited number of funds and investment trusts that specialise in social projects, although there are likely to be further launches in the future.

One such fund is Schroder BSC Social Impact, an investment trust launched in December last year by investment manager Schroders and social investment institution Big Society Capital.

The £77million trust invests in projects that aim to tackle homelessness, provide support for people with learning disabilities, offer housing for domestic abuse survivors, and address other pressing social challenges.

For example, it recently invested in the Stronger Families programme. This supports young people and families in Norfolk by improving communication between them and thereby enabling young people to stay with their families rather than go into care.

If a young person does not go into care because the programme has been successful, it receives a payment from the council to reflect their improved life chances and reduced care costs.

James Lowe, investment trust business development manager at Schroders, says: 'The trust aims to make a return of two per cent above inflation. It is not just about making a profit – the social impact it brings about is just as important.'

Laith Khalaf is a financial analyst at investment platform AJ Bell. He believes the Schroder trust is innovative, but warns that as it is so new it lacks a credible performance record.

He says the investment trust structure is well suited to this type of investment.

This is because investment trusts are closed-ended, which means that investors can withdraw their money at any time without forcing the fund managers to sell any underlying assets, which may not be easy to do without plenty of notice.

Shares in the trust can be bought at £1.05, although the fact that they stand at a premium to the fund's underlying assets may deter some investors.

Khalaf says that anyone who want a more diversified fund that invests in listed companies providing a positive environmental and social impact might consider Liontrust Sustainable Future Global Growth.

There is a number of investment opportunities to help out & make a decent investment return

This has turned a £1,000 investment into £1,757 over three years and invests in well-run companies around the world whose products are shaping the global economy of the future.

Some property investment trusts also specialise in providing social housing and buildings for essential services.

Susannah Streeter is senior investment and markets analyst at wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown.

She likes Civitas Social Housing, which provides supported living accommodation for tenants with learning disabilities and mental health needs.

'The investments are mainly based on long-term leases with registered providers, so they should provide a stable rental return,' she says.

'There is also likely to be strong demand for the accommodation the trust invests in, given the lack of specialist housing to meet the needs of potential residents. The company has already developed a pipeline of potential acquisitions.'

The trust has turned a £1,000 investment into £1,328 over three years and last week announced a quarterly dividend of 1.3875 pence a share. It also claims it has created 'social value' of £127million in the year to April, through direct cost savings to the public purse and improved wellbeing for its residents.

Streeter also likes Primary Health Properties. This trust invests in community healthcare facilities, earning an income from the leases it negotiates with the tenants (usually Government-backed).

Other trusts with a social impact thrust include Target Healthcare and Triple Point Social Housing.

Investors can access social projects through funds and stock market-listed investment trusts

Investing through an Innovative Finance Isa

The innovative finance Isa is the lesser-known cousin of the stocks and shares Isa and cash Isa. It too is a tax-free wrapper and all UK taxpayers are entitled to put up to £20,000 – their full Isa allowance – into one every tax year.

A number of social projects are available to invest in through an innovative finance Isa.

For example, through its innovative finance Isa, the ethical bank Triodos offers access to a range of social impact investments.

It recently raised £1.5million to support Paces Sheffield, a leading charity for people with cerebral palsy and other neurological motor disorders.

The eight-year bond offered pays six per cent interest per year, with a minimum investment of £50.

Other recent investments include helping the YMCA to develop a community and activity village in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire – and helping charity Thera Trust to provide homes for people with learning disabilities.

Returns are not guaranteed and there is no protection for investors if something goes wrong. It is also not always possible to get money out early, so investors need to be able to invest for the long term.

Abundance Investment also offers access to social projects through an innovative finance Isa.

It has just launched an investment in Sterling Suffolk, a commercial tomato grower which is reducing the environmental cost of growing tomatoes in the UK with cutting-edge glasshouse technology.

Investors will earn eight per cent per year over the bond's 11-year term, although the return is not guaranteed.

Britons consume more than 500,000 tons of fresh tomatoes each year, but four fifths are imported, leading to a high environmental cost.

Bruce Davis, co-founder and managing director of Abundance Investment, says: 'Finding scalable ways to cut the environmental cost of the foods we eat has to be a priority if we want to feed ourselves more sustainably in the transition to a net zero economy.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The 'granny' annexe has deep roots, but now it's annexes of all kinds that are in high demand.

Councils received around 9,000 planning applications for them in 2019/20 — that's 25 a day, according to Churchill Home Insurance.

Around a fifth of these are to convert existing outbuildings like a garage or a shed. But the large majority are for completely new premises in the garden — for childcare, home schooling, office space and shielding, which were cited among the biggest reasons.

A bit on the side: Converting an unused shed could add £91,000 to the value of your home

There's a cash bonus to this. Churchill claims annexes add an average £91,000 to the value of a home and make it a far better proposition when it comes to selling.

'Any property with a purpose-built office or studio gains more interest from purchasers.

It is also a common request from buyers on their wants-list,' says Giles Davidson of Hamptons estate agency.

So how do you go about joining Britain's annexe army? Firstly, decide on size and purpose. If it's serving a single function — like a games space or a home office — it need only be a large room, perhaps with a loo and basic kitchenette.

If it's for use as a home gym it may require stronger floors and walls; and if it's for something like recording music (or playing music in the case of teenagers) consider the best soundproofing you can afford.

By contrast, if the annexe is to host people overnight — whether friends or Airbnb or holiday let guests — most annexes would have at least one bedroom and en suite bathroom, a living space and a modest kitchen.

Large purpose-built annexes are likely to require a full planning application

Secondly, choose whether you buy a kit or get a one-off purpose-built annexe.

Some companies offer flat packs: prices vary according to size and materials, with basic costs topped up by add-ons such as toilets, showers, air conditioning and extra windows. If you're going for a purpose-built annexe, hire an architect or specialised company and expect to pay more.

Thirdly, submit a planning application — if required. It's likely that a simple conversion of a garage or an existing garden house into living quarters may not need planning consent, but larger purpose-built annexes are likely to require a full application. These should take no more than eight weeks to be agreed or rejected.

The Government has relaxed so-called permitted development rules but there are strict limits on height, size and uses for annexes, plus extra controls if the main house is listed or in a conservation area. Check planningportal.co.uk.

Finally, treat the finished annexe as part of the house for insurance purposes.

'Anyone considering constructing or converting a garden annexe needs to inform their insurer that work is taking place and consider the additional building and contents on their policy once it's complete,' says Pritpal Powar of Churchill.

Such is the growing popularity of annexes that many estate agents suggest sellers with sufficiently large gardens or land secure planning permission for one ahead of putting the property on the market — even if they don't build it.

For the buyer, this consent gives a signal that they can build an annexe if they wish, including an idea of size and position. Consent also adds to the value of the property, so both sides of the deal gain.

Some 70 countries have mature stock exchanges, with 16 having a market cap of more than $1trillion. Markets often vary depending on what’s happening in their host country. Last month, for example, saw Chinese shares drop after Beijing signalled a tougher approach to tech and education firms.

Investment bank MSCI (formerly Morgan Stanley) produces comparative data on stock-market performance, and if judged on the past five years, Taiwan - famed for its high-tech economy — comes out on top with a 270 per cent return. Yet the country’s stock-market is seen as an emerging market - a riskier bet.

Investment bank MSCI gives comparative data on stock-market performance. If judged on the past five years, Taiwan comes out on top with a 270% return

The silver medal goes to the Netherlands, whose MSCI index shows an impressive 239 per cent return since 2016. The Dutch stock exchange is deemed a developed market - meaning its considered more suitable for retail investors.

The Gulf state of Kuwait - another emerging market - takes bronze with a return of 228 per cent. Hot on its heels is the U.S. with a 220 per cent return since 2016. Saudi Arabia is next with a 209 per cent return. It’s a disappointing finish for Team GB: 25th place amongst developed and emerging markets.

But it isn’t all bad: the UK market delivered a 128 per cent return. Olympics medal table-leader China finishes 12th, with a 179 per cent return. But what does it mean for investors? First off, a stock-market doesn’t always reflect a country’s wider performance, it’s a measure of the companies listed there. The UK’s FTSE, for example, has been skewed by multinationals such as Shell.

These companies produce billions, but their shares aren’t dynamic. Smaller markets can also be distorted by a few super-performers. It’s telling that both Taiwan and the Netherlands host companies making semiconductors. These materials power smartphones and have seen a surge in demand.

The stock-market Olympics isn’t perfect, but it reminds us why we need a diverse portfolio

Shares in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) are up 235 per cent since 2016, while Dutch producer ASML is up 607 per cent. TSMC was a top ten holding for the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust — until Baillie Gifford reduced its stake in January. The firm makes up 40 per cent of Taiwan’s MSCI Index.

The stock-market Olympics isn’t perfect, but it reminds us why we need a diverse portfolio. Buying foreign shares directly can be complicated. Instead, most investors use funds to get their exposure to foreign markets.

As these funds are UK-registered, they are easier to buy — and can be put in a stocks and shares Isa. Active funds are run by professional stock-pickers who aim to pick companies that can beat the relevant MSCI benchmark. For larger markets, there are
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Growing numbers of UK households are already using satellite broadband, most of them in rural areas, new research has revealed.

Satellite broadband can offer a more reliable service for people in locations that are poorly served by traditional connections and are unlikely to have access to full fibre internet.

However, despite its appeal, set-up costs of about £500 deter two thirds of potential consumers from trying this form of broadband connection, according to data from Uswitch.

This is Money takes a look at exactly what satellite broadband is, if it could be beneficial for you and how expensive it really is.

Some customers are said to be put off having satellite broadband due to the cost of installation

How does satellite broadband work?

Much like satellite TV, satellite broadband is beamed from space to a satellite dish that's installed on the property. It then gets hooked up to a Wi-Fi router like normal broadband.

As it doesn't rely on a network of cables going into every home, it's expected to become a favourable option for people living in rural areas in the years to come.

The new satellite internet technology that's currently being introduced is expected to completely replace the older, slower system that currently exists.

Firms like Tesla billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX and OneWeb are revolutionising the technology with satellites now able to provide internet speeds of up to 300Mbps.

This is much faster than the UK's average speed which currently stands at 64Mbps.

To put this into perspective, you could use satellite broadband to download a two-hour HD film in around four and a half minutes but it would take roughly 18 minutes with a speed of 64Mbps.

Is it expensive?

Customers looking to benefit from satellite broadband will have to pay to have a satellite installed at the side of their home, along with a transmitter.

This costs around £500 but could be even more expensive which might put many off.

However, users of the technology say they pay £29.70 a month on average for the service, compared to an average £33.60 for all broadband customers.

If sticking with satellite broadband, whilst the upfront cost is high, it could mean you make savings over the long term.

Elon Musk's Starlink is one of the two firms in the UK offering consumers satellite broadband

Who would benefit from satellite broadband?

Almost 200,000 UK homes are currently struggling with speeds lower than 10Mbps — the level that Ofcom considers a decent service.

This means for rural households, satellite broadband could be a lifeline due to their unreliable or slow existing connections.

Coverage from satellite broadband is set to become universal with Elon Musk beginning a UK trial of his Starlink satellite broadband system in January.

It is hoped this will have 500,000 users worldwide within a year while BT has joined forces with operator OneWeb to provide connections to people in remote areas.

Other existing UK satellite broadband providers include Broadband Everywhere, Freedomsat, KONNECT and Satellite Internet.

Whilst there is the option of full fibre broadband, which can in some cases provide similar speeds to satellite internet, those in rural areas are unlikely to see any infrastructure built in their area for some years due to the difficulty and expense of the operation.

Holly Cox, head of digital at Compare the Market, said: 'If you live in a remote rural area then satellite broadband could be a good option to get online.

'The main advantage of satellite broadband is that is available wherever you are in the UK, reaching places that cables can't. All you need is an outside wall to install a satellite dish that has a clear view of the sky to the south.

'That makes it ideal for areas where fixed-line broadband is painfully slow or even non-existent.'

According to Ofcom, which received data from providers and estimates for providers who haven’t submitted data to the watchdog, there were around 27,000 fixed satellite broadband connections at the end of 2020.

Satellite broadband could be a 'lifeline' for rural customers struggling to get decent internet

What are the downsides?

Aside from the high set up cost of around £500, extreme weather can also affect a satellite broadband connection with heavy rain and wind potentially reducing speeds or even causing an outage.

Another issue is the latency which is the delay, or lag, between requesting online information and receiving it, according to Compare the Market.

Satellite broadband suffers from high latency because of the time it takes for a broadband signal to travel to Earth from the geostationary orbit, 22,200 miles up in space.

This means it could prove problematic if you're live streaming, gaming or video calling on VoIP services such as Skype.

However, there are plans to launch Low Earth Orbit satellites in the next few years which will orbit closer to Earth and could help resolve the latency issue for satellite broadband users.

Cox added: 'There are some significant drawbacks to using satellite broadband. The biggest issue for most households will be the set-up cost which can be around £600.

'Also, unlike the range of fibre optic packages that offer unlimited data, most satellite broadband packages have a monthly data usage cap or might only give you a certain amount of data at top speed.

'This means you'll need to work out how much you're likely to download each month before taking out a contract. For context, it takes about 1GB of data to stream Netflix at standard definition for an hour.

'Some satellite broadband providers do offer contracts with an unlimited off-peak period, which can be used for larger downloads.

'Prices range from around £20 per month up to around £87, the cost can be higher depending on how much data is needed.'

Satellites now able to provide internet speeds of up to 300Mbps - similar to full fibre options

Are there many good deals?

Whilst there are several firms offering the older, slower version of satellite broadband, there are only two companies giving customers the new, speedier alternative.

Starlink and OneWeb are the two firms offering the service in the UK, however, not everyone will be able to join.

Only customers in select rural locations can access Starlink services with OneWeb still not available to households just yet.

However, consumers will not have long to wait as the expansion is happening rapidly with hopes for OneWeb to launch in October 2021, with a global operation available by June 2022.

Similarly, Starlink is expanding its offerings to more customers as time goes on.

Ernest Doku, broadband expert at Uswitch, said: 'Satellite broadband is improving all the time, and with big players like Starlink entering the UK market, connections are only going to get faster and more reliable.

'Satellite broadband offers hope to residents in rural areas who have struggled to get a decent connection from traditional providers, and we'll be watching to see how BT's partner with OneWeb grows over the coming years.

'While it's tempting to think that one technology can solve the problem of the digital divide, there is no single solution to rural broadband.

'Many households are still on ADSL connections and enduring slow speeds unnecessarily, unaware that in many cases they could upgrade to fibre broadband and still save themselves money.

'Anyone who is still battling with slow broadband should run a speed test to find out how reliable the connection really is.

'If you're not happy with the results, run a comparison online and see if you can get both a better deal and a faster service.'

Cox added: 'Before installing satellite broadband, it is a good idea to check if alternatives options are available, even if you can't get access to fixed line broadband.

'If your area is covered by a 4G mobile network, mobile broadband could offer a cheaper and faster way to get connected.

'It works using the same data networks you connect to on your smartphone, and you'll be able to take your internet connection with you wherever you go.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Easy-access savings rates are nudging upwards with providers seemingly jostling for customers.

Investec has increased the rate on its online flexi saver from 0.45 per cent to 0.58 per cent. It comes after Skipton Building Society increased its easy-access rate last week to 0.6 per cent.

Top rates on these bread and butter accounts have been in the 0.4 to 0.5 per cent range for most of the year, since falling from 1 per cent last summer.

Savers now have three easy access savings providers paying in excess of 0.5 per cent to choose from.

Meanwhile, Coventry Building Society also increased its savings rates last week - its limited access saver account now pays 0.55 per cent.

The average easy-access account pays just 0.18 per cent interest, according to Moneyfacts, suggesting that savers can typically triple their rate by moving their cash.

Many savers will be earning far less than this, often with their cash held with large banks paying between 0.01 per cent and 0.06 per cent interest.

Among the worst is HSBC, along with Lloyds (including Halifax) and NatWest with a rate of just 0.01 per cent - just 10p interest a year on £1,000.

The increases from Coventry, Skipton and Investec is good news for savers, according to James Blower, founder of the Savings Guru.

'Firstly, the rates are a big improvement on the 0.4 per cent to 0.5 per cent range that the best buys have been in for most of 2021, since they started to fall from the 1 per cent level last September.

'Secondly, Coventry, Skipton and Investec are larger savings providers so have bigger balance sheets which can support the strong inflows of customers they will see with these rates.

'Whereas some of the small new entrants could only cope with the inflows these rates will generate for a couple of days, it is likely that these three will hold here for a few weeks and possibly into September.

'This increases the likelihood that other banks and building societies will follow suit and increase their rates to compete.

'I'd be surprised if we didn't see at least one more provider join that group paying 0.55 - 0.6 per cent or even possibly go slightly above.'

What should savers consider when choosing an easy access account?

Savers looking for the best easy-access savings deal would be wise to always double check how accessible their cash will be once in the account.

Investec's easy-access account pays interest on balances between £5,000 and £250,000, provides instant access to savings, and allows unlimited deposits and withdrawals to a linked current account.

However, market leader Skipton's easy-access account limits savers to three withdrawals a year whilst Coventry allows six per year after which savers forfeit 50 days interest.

The minimum balance requirements are also a major consideration for savers.

Investec allows unlimited withdrawals, both it and Skipton require £5,000 to open an account as opposed to just £1 for Coventry.

Rachel Springall, personal finance expert at Moneyfacts said: 'Easy-access accounts are ideal for savers who want a flexible pot.

'But two things to keep in mind is that these rates are variable so can change anytime, plus some easy access accounts limit the number of withdrawals you can take within the year.'

One alternative for savers, who are concerned at the prospect of losing access to their cash for a fixed time period, is to opt for a notice account.

Savers can achieve higher returns albeit having to provide a few month's notice to withdraw their cash.

For example Hampshire Trust Bank is currently offering a rate of 0.85 per cent, although savers will need to give 95 days notice to withdraw funds.

Investec is also currently offering a rate of 0.7 per cent which only requires a 35 days notice period in order to withdraw.

Savers who apply via the savings platform, Raisin can also qualify for a welcome bonus payment of up to £50 depending on how much they put in.

For those savers looking to stash away cash for a year or more and don't require access to their cash, better returns can be achieved by turning to a fixed rate deal, where there has been more competition and subsequently far better rates than instant-access.

The best one year fixed rate account, offered by Gatehouse Bank, is currently paying interest of 1.1 per cent, while the best two-year deal by Zopa Bank is paying 1.26 per cent.

Blower said: 'Easy-access accounts are great for savers who want access to their money, are saving for emergencies or are building a savings pot for an event in the near future such as a holiday or wedding.

'However, if you are saving for something with a longer term horizon, or you don't need access, then it's worth looking at a regular savings account, a fixed rate bond, or a notice account where the rates are significantly higher.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I have been taking my private pension for three years now with the help of a financial adviser who transferred it to a drawdown pension.

I paid him a percentage of my £400,000 pot which I was happy to do, but I'm happy with my pension provider and my returns and I don't foresee it changing anytime soon.

However, I am still paying my financial adviser £4,000 pounds a year. Do I still need to do this or can I cancel him but then just use him if and when I need him and pay a one-off fee instead? Thanks for any advice.

Do you have to keep paying the adviser who set up your pension investments?

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Steve Webb replies: It’s good that you’ve had a positive experience with financial advice around your pension transfer but also entirely proper to challenge whether you are getting good value when it comes to ongoing advice.

Whilst I think there is a case for ongoing advice, especially with a relatively large pension pot, any fee needs to be justified and there are things you can do if you are not satisfied.

Starting with your pension transfer, as you know, for any transfer out of a final salary type pension worth more than £30,000, financial advice about the transfer is mandatory, though it is not if you are moving a pot from a defined contribution work scheme.

There is no legal requirement to take ongoing financial advice once you have transferred. But there are some reasons why it might still be worth doing.

The first is that you are now in a world where all the decisions about how your money is invested are down to you.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

At the very least, your investments need to be reviewed periodically, as the right answer for someone starting to draw down at sixty is unlikely to be the right answer for someone well through retirement.

Second, not only do your needs change but also markets and economic conditions change.

You only have to think back a decade to realise that investment returns can change very quickly, and a financial adviser can help to make sure that your current investment mix is the best fit for current (and expected) market conditions.

Something else which changes is the tax system. In recent years we have seen big changes to pension tax relief and there are regular rumours of further changes to come which could make the system less generous.

A good adviser will keep abreast of the latest changes and will help to make sure you know how best to respond.

Another reason for taking financial advice is that you need to think about much more than just your pension pot.

You need to consider things like the needs of other family members (such as a partner if you were to die, or any children who you want to inherit some of your wealth).

You need to think about your tax position, including any inheritance tax liability. You may also want to look at any wealth tied up in the value of your home and also the possibility of future long-term care costs.

What are defined contribution and final salary pensions? Defined contribution pensions take contributions from both employer and employee and invest them to provide a pot of money at retirement. Unless you work in the public sector, they have now mostly replaced more generous gold-plated defined benefit - or final salary - pensions, which provide a guaranteed income after retirement until you die. Defined contribution pensions are stingier and savers bear the investment risk, rather than employers.

In short, a good financial adviser will be giving you ‘holistic’ advice, not just on how you invest your transferred pension pot but on your wider financial circumstances, on the latest changes in the economy and in the tax system, and on how best to provide for your wider family.

If you cancel all advice and only ask for it when you think you need it, it is possible you may fail to seek advice when you need it most.

But having said all of that, there is no reason to accept a particular fee level without challenge.

Whilst 1 per cent is a ‘nice round number’, there aren’t many things for which you would pay £4,000 without asking a lot of questions first!

Assuming you are with an independent financial adviser then it is highly unlikely that there are any contractual reasons why you could not end the retainer arrangement altogether if you wished.

At the very least you could ask your IFA to set out what work he has done for you in the last year, including how many hours he has spent, and say that you would like a reduced charge for the coming year.

Whilst 1 per cent is a ‘nice round number’, there aren’t many things for which you would pay £4,000 without asking a lot of questions first!

The Financial Conduct Authority, which oversees financial advice, expects advisers to be able to justify ongoing charges of this sort and not just rely on inertia.

The situation is more complex if you have signed up with what is called a ‘vertically integrated’ adviser who has sold you financial products which only their firm offers.

It is possible that when you signed up with them you committed to ongoing advice as part of the deal.

If you say you don’t want advice from them any more you may have to move your money to alternative investments and there could well be exit penalties. You should obviously research this carefully before you make any decisions.

Want one-off financial advice? Find out what you should ask for and expect to get... and how much it might cost here.

Many financial advisers now use in-house or tied funds and platforms when they arrange pension drawdown for clients. So, anyone who has not yet transferred a pension should also research the implications of ongoing fees and exit fees thoroughly when choosing an adviser.

There are financial advisers who will set up pension drawdown portfolios that can be moved easily, or accessed by other advisers in future.

It can also be tricky to ‘switch off’ advice costs if you took out a product before a major rule change in 2012.

Prior to this date financial advice was often ‘free’ up front to the member but paid for out of deductions over the life of the product.

As a result, there can be ‘exit penalties’ on some products to stop people taking their money before the cost of the initial advice has been recouped.

I don’t think this applies in your situation but could be a reason why some people might face a barrier to switching off advice charges.

In short, I think there is a good case for ongoing advice because ‘you don’t know what you don’t know’.

But you are quite right to ensure you are getting value for money and it may well be that you could get similar ongoing advice for less than you are currently paying.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It hasn't taken long for Baltimore-based Chris Berrier to make an impact at Jupiter US Smaller Companies, a fund he was appointed to run in April by its board of directors after the retirement of the previous manager.

For a start, the trust's name has since been changed to Brown Advisory US Smaller Companies in acknowledgement of the US company Berrier has worked for since the early 2000s. The fund's charges have also been tickled down to give shareholders a bigger slice of future returns.

But more importantly, the portfolio has been overhauled with only two of the 37 holdings that Berrier inherited surviving. The result is a £165million trust that today comprises 79 stocks with a strong emphasis on health care and IT companies.

In contrast, exposure to cyclical businesses such as energy and financials have been cut to the bone. The two stocks that survived the cull are outdoor sports equipment supplier Clarus Corporation and biopharmaceutical company Neurocrine Biosciences.

Berrier is unapologetic about the upheaval. 'When the board courted us,' he says, 'they liked our desire to change the portfolio to one with a greater emphasis on growth companies. So when we came on board at the beginning of April, we thought it would be unfair to shareholders if we took a long time to change things. As a result, the portfolio transition was done within three weeks – swift but thoughtfully carried out.'

It means that stocks such as used car dealership America's Car Mart and banking group Home BancShares have been disposed of. In their place have come in waste management company Waste Connections and financial software company Workiva.

The changes mean the trust now reflects the small cap growth equity strategy that Berrier has applied successfully at Brown Advisory since 2006 – managing small cap assets in excess of £5billion. It has also resulted in the trust now being similar in portfolio composition to the longstanding investment fund Brown Advisory US Smaller Companies that has generated five-year returns of 108 per cent.

Unlike this fund, the trust is listed on the stock market and has the ability to borrow if it wants to increase its equity exposure.

Berrier says the companies he targets are those that possess three key 'G' factors – the ability to 'grow' their businesses over the long term; have good 'governance' such as an outstanding management team with financial interests aligned with those of long-term shareholders; and a 'go-to' strategy that means they can ultimately translate business growth into profits.

He adds: 'When these three G factors are present in a company, the business has a better than average chance of going from being a small cap to a mid cap and ultimately a large cap business.'

Although the investment universe he scrutinises comprises more than 2,000 companies, he says that once the 'too small, too big, and don't like' businesses are pushed to one side, there are some 200 stocks his team look at every day.

The trust does not invest in unquoted US stocks although Berrier says he keeps a close eye on them because some will list on the stock market and be investment targets.

Describing his modus operandi, Berrier says: 'I like to buy companies I can hold long term and that will generate investment returns year in and year out. All the time, I try to avoid the two cardinal investment sins – selling winners too soon and running with losers for too long.'

The trust's stock market identification code is 0346340 and the annual management charge is 0.7 per cent.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investing in shares listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) provides a chance to participate in the success of some of the country's – indeed, the world's – fastest growing companies: the likes of drinks mixer producer Fever–Tree and online fashion retailers Asos and Boohoo. But it's not without risk.

For every success story such as Fever-Tree – its share price is up by 265 per cent over the past five years – there is a failure like high street café chain Patisserie Valerie, which collapsed into administration in 2019, leaving investors holding worthless shares.

It explains why many prefer to invest in such businesses through a smaller companies investment fund that has exposure to a broad portfolio of firms, some of which are listed on AIM.

The top performing UK smaller companies fund over the past year – Premier Miton UK Smaller Companies – has 65 per cent of its portfolio invested in companies that form the FTSE AIM All-Share Index. It has delivered a rousing return of nearly 95 per cent.

As its name indicates, Stonehage Fleming AIM is a smaller companies fund primarily focused on AIM-listed stocks.

Although it hasn't matched Premier Miton's returns, it has still recorded a one-year return of 60 per cent.

By comparison, the index has risen by 38 per cent. The £135million fund is jointly managed by Nick Burchett and Paul Mumford, who constantly scour AIM for investment opportunities, analysing daily regulatory news service (RNS) announcements on companies they are either interested in or already invested in.

They also devour any brokers' comments on companies that they are keeping an eye on.

'It's such an exciting market to be invested in,' says Mumford. 'It's about looking under the bonnet of companies and speaking to brokers and the management of companies you're invested in.'

He adds: 'Unlike FTSE100 companies where access to senior people is nigh on impossible, we can pick up the phone and usually speak straightaway to any of the directors who run the businesses we have a stake in.

'Sometimes, we even help companies become better businesses by giving them some advice.'

The managers are also keen advocates of 'capital market days' where companies make presentations about their businesses and investors can ask questions.

These are now often conducted via Zoom although before the pandemic struck, they would often involve a visit to a factory.

'Nick likes to kick tyres,' says Mumford. 'Just by visiting a company site and seeing how the management and workforce interact, you can get a good feel for how a business is run.'

The Stonehage Fleming AIM fund is invested across 70 companies – a strategy designed to minimise any losses if a particular holding turns sour (it was an investor in Patisserie Valerie).

Certain sectors of the market tend to be avoided for risk reasons, such as mining, financials, biotech and hotels. The managers are also not keen on companies that join AIM from overseas. 'A lot can go wrong,' says Mumford.

Recent additions to the portfolio include robotics company Blue Prism and property business Hargreaves Services.

The biggest holding is healthcare company Totally, which accounts for 3.7 per cent of the fund. 'It's rare for a holding to account for more than five per cent of the portfolio,' says Mumford, 'but we do like to run with our winners.'

The fund's ongoing annual charge is 0.68 per cent and the stock market identification number is B0JX3Z5. Stonehage Fleming is a wealth manager that looks after the financial interests of wealthy families.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Avon Protection lost almost a quarter of its value after the body armour maker said disruptions in its supply chain would hammer turnover for the next two years.

Around £260million was wiped off Avon's market capitalisation as it slashed revenue forecasts to between £178million and £188million.

This is significantly lower than City forecasts, which put it at more than £200million.

Tough times: Avon Protection lost almost a quarter of its value after the body armour maker said disruptions in its supply chain would hammer turnover for the next two years

The problems will also spill over into the next financial year.

Revenues will be between £231million and £246million – lower than estimates of £258million.

Although the trading updates did not spell out how this would affect profits, the fall in revenues means they will take a hit.

Previously known as Avon Rubber, the company's long history stretches back to the 19th century. It supplied 20million gas masks during the Second World War and floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1949.

Its focus has evolved over the years and it now specialises in body armour and military helmets – as well as gas masks – after selling a dairy division that made tubes and systems to milk and monitor cows.

The FTSE250 defence contractor and American armed forces supplier said there had been a series of order delays, supply chain disruptions and a 'tight' US labour market, which means employers are having to compete for workers.

Hold-ups to a specific order – for M50 gas masks – were blamed on 'procurement bottlenecks'.

Investors also took badly to another warning that there are 'remaining uncertainties' as to when it will receive and ship other orders before the end of the financial year.

Shares in Avon – which has been an outperformer on the stock market in recent years – nosedived by 27.7 per cent, or 818p, to 2132p last night. Avon's day in the doldrums did little to hold back the wider mid-cap index, which rose 0.2 per cent, or 41.68 points, to 23788.45.

The larger FTSE100 also made gains, advancing 0.4 per cent, or 25.48 points, to 7218.71.

The rise saw the Footsie cap off its longest weekly winning streak since November.

Oil prices held steady at $71 a barrel after slides triggered by fears of the spread of the Delta variant, which traders worry could lead to more lockdowns that will lessen demand.

Goldman Sachs analysts said a recent call from the US for Opec nations to increase the amount of oil they produce is unlikely to be heeded in the short term.

BP slipped 0.5 per cent, or 1.6p, to 305.35p, while Shell finished down 1.1 per cent, down 15.4p, to 1438.8p.

Thungela Resources shot higher after turnover skyrocketed by 500 per cent to £490million in its maiden results as an independent company.

The thermal coal group was spun off from Anglo American in June into a separate firm on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges. It swung from a £6million loss in the first half of 2020 to a £17million profit in the same period of this year. Shares rose 6.5 per cent, or 14.7p, or 242.4p.

Traders also snapped up BHP stock, which climbed 1.5 per cent, or 34p, to 2322.5p.

The rise comes as anticipation in the City grows that the world's largest mining company will deliver a verdict on the future of its petrol business in annual results next week.

Elsewhere, Packaging company Essentra has hired Dupsy Abiola, a former Dragons' Den contestant whose father once ran for president in Nigeria, as part of a new scheme of appointing a trainee to the company's board.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The global shortage of a vital component, found in items as diverse as toasters and MRI scanners, could serve as an alert to update your portfolio – as long as you have a taste for technology and geopolitical risk.

The scarce commodity in question is the microchip, also known as a chip or semiconductor.

Chips are the heart of the ever-increasing array of electronic devices on which our lives depend, including toasters and MRI scanners, but also washing machines, laptops and mobile phones.

Shortage: Chips are the heart of the ever-increasing array of electronic devices on which our lives depend

Chips are also essential for artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics and 5G infrastructure which are all set for vast expansion. As one would-be wit put it: 'It's chips in everything.'

The multiplicity of uses helps explain why the crisis in supply, sparked by the pandemic, was dubbed 'Chipmaggedon'.

As Covid spread, some chip companies cut output, even as people raced to buy new gadgets. Subsequently manufacturers have also been hampered by factors like drought (their processes require lots of water).

The resulting rise in chip prices has been good for shares in semiconductor companies. But the automotive industry has suffered.

Infineon, the German semiconductor group, estimates there is an average of $434 of content in a petrol car and $834 worth of semiconductors in an electric vehicle.

Unable to secure sufficient chips, motor manufacturers may lose an estimated $110billion in sales this year. To offset this, they are raising the cost of some models – one reason why car hire is more expensive this summer.

The availability of chips may be slightly improving, but a fall-off in demand is not expected.

Instead, the mighty Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) forecasts a 'structural and fundamental increase' and is planning $100bn in capital expenditure over the next three years.

TSMC is the world's largest 'fabricator' or manufacturer. It controls 84pc of the market in the most sophisticated chips.

TSMC made its stock market debut in 1997 when there were about 28 other major fabricators, as Michael Flitton co-manager of the Cerno Pacific fund explains: 'As a result of inexorable consolidation, there are three today – TSMC, Samsung in Korea and Intel from the US. We own TSMC and Samsung because these companies have deep economic moats, making it difficult for others compete, given the multi-million cost of lithography machines from ASML.'

Shares in this Dutch group, the world's number one in its field, have soared by 57 per cent this year.

Mounting excitement over the prospects for ASML and TSMC lie behind the 57 per cent rise over the past year in the PHLX Semiconductor Index of companies in every semiconductor activity. Most analysts are bullish. But anyone venturing into the sector must be aware that its geopolitical background is as complicated as any video game (yes, another thing that needs microchips).

The stance of governments is set to have even more of an influence on the direction of share prices: the possible threat posed by China to Taiwan is key to understanding TSMC's strategy, for example.

How and where politicians will become involved is impossible to predict. The fate of Arm, the British semiconductor designer, is a case in point. Arm, owned by the Japanese conglomerate Softbank, is being snapped up by Nvidia, the Californian group. But the Government is yet to intervene, although it is again reviewing another less controversial deal – the Chinese takeover of Newport Wafer Fab, the chip producer.

Chris Ford of the Sanlam AI fund, which holds some semiconductor stocks, warns of the potential impact of tensions between superpowers with the sector becoming 'something of a battleground between the US and China'.

An extra political dimension makes any investment even more interesting for me. Investors who feel the same – and can contemplate a gamble – can gain some exposure to semiconductors through two exchange traded funds: Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor.

US banks are particularly enthusiastic about the prospects for semiconductors. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs rate Samsung and TSMC, while Bank of America likes ASML, Applied Materials, NXP Semiconductors and ON Semiconductor.

The last two supply auto manufacturers which, like so many other industries, can go nowhere without semiconductors since they are the building blocks of our future. If you'd like to know more about the science behind this, ASML's website provides an intelligible guide.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Millions of pounds could be flowing out of the UK every week as a result of private equity firms' reliance on tax havens, analysis shows.

The top ten largest private equity groups operating in Britain all have links to offshore financial hubs, research by the Labour Party found.

Cinven, Paperchase-rescuer Permira, Apax and the recently listed Bridgepoint, which was spun out of Natwest Bank in 2000, all use complicated corporate structures that involves them having funds or holding companies in the likes of Guernsey and Luxembourg.

Offshore: Firms use complicated corporate structures that involves them having funds or holding companies in the likes of Guernsey (pictured) and Luxembourg

Private equity firms claim they use them because it is an easier way to manage the array of companies they often own or fund around the world.

But campaigners and politicians say the structures make it difficult to know how much tax revenue the Treasury is missing out on.

These missing revenues could be used to fund the UK's recovery from Covid, which has seen the Government plough billions into support programmes to keep the country and businesses functioning.

James Murray, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The Treasury are standing by when they should be cracking down on millions leaving their coffers.

'The Chancellor has been turning a blind eye as British businesses face being undermined by tech giants who don't pay their tax, or being taken over by risky private equity companies.

'We want the Government to change course.'

HG and former Rolls-Royce investor Invest Industrial both have links with Luxembourg, BC Partners with Guernsey, and Triton, Vitruvian and IK Invest with Jersey.

Robert Palmer, executive director of campaign group Tax Justice UK, said: 'Private equity companies often asset strip when they buy British businesses, while at the same time finding very clever ways of paying little or no tax.

'This reduces money flowing into the Treasury and can often destroy good companies,' he said.

'The Government should be closing tax loopholes that allow this behaviour.

'Right now the Government is working out how to build back from the pandemic and it seems to me that private equity is ripe to be paying more in tax.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Happy days: Jackie Weaver would give more funding to parish councils if she were made Chancellor of the Exchequer

Jackie Weaver would give more funding to parish councils if she were made Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The 69-year-old shot to fame earlier this year after she kicked argumentative male councillors off an explosive Zoom meeting of Handforth parish council in Cheshire.

As chief officer of the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, she remained cool and unflustered when one man told her: 'You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver.'

Another shouted: 'Read the standing orders! Read them and understand them!'

She says that financially, her new-found fame after the video footage went viral on the internet has made little difference to her life although she can now earn up to £5,000 for half a day's work.

Her book of common sense advice, You Do Have Authority Here, is out next month and her humorous podcast Jackie Weaver Has The Authority is available to listen to now.

What did your parents teach you about money?

To save it. They were cautious with money and thought you should put it away for a rainy day.

I come from a working class background. My dad worked at a steelworks in Stoke-onTrent. He started off as a boltmaker and worked his way up to manager.

My mother did various jobs. She nursed people in a care home, ran an antiques business, and even worked as a taxi driver. I think she never really found out what she wanted to do.

I knew money was tight when I was growing up because my school uniform was second-hand. We didn't go short of food, but there wasn't a lot of money to go around. That was a source of stress for my parents.

They always argued about money. Having grown up with angry parents, I hate arguments and I don't like displays of aggression.

Have you ever struggled to make ends meet?

Yes, when I was in my late teens. I left home at 17 and got my first job working for a computing company, showing people how to use its software. I was suddenly eligible for all these credit and store cards and used them to buy lots of stuff. I felt really flush.

I then realised my repayments were not making any impression on my debts and I didn't earn enough money to make bigger payments.

Eventually, I confessed to my dad I'd run up all this debt. I think it was £1,000 – which was a lot of money in those days. He paid it off as a 21st birthday present.

That was a turning point. Afterwards, I became more careful with money. Nowadays, I pay off my credit cards in full each month.

Have you ever been paid silly money?

Yes. I have done the odd social media advert over the past year.

The most I was paid was £5,000 for about half a day's work.

This was a few weeks after the Handforth parish council meeting went viral. All I had to do was read a script.

Companies and organisations now approach me and say: 'We need someone to talk about this, you'd be ideal.' I tell them I don't know anything about it. 'Yes,' they say, 'but you'd still be ideal'.

How has your viral fame affected you?

Financially, it hasn't made much difference. Most of what I do is either for free or I donate my fee to charity.

I am in a comfortable financial position and live a frugal life. For example, it would never occur to me and my husband to go out to eat, although we do treat ourselves to fish and chips occasionally.

The big difference is that I am a lot busier.

I have met all sorts of interesting people through my podcast and most importantly I have been able to witter on to anyone who will listen about how important town and parish councils are.

I now have 30,000 Twitter followers which I see as an opportunity to reach more people and hopefully encourage them, young and old, to get involved.

What was the best financial year of your life?

It was 2006, the first year I worked full-time. I took a ten-year career break when I had my three children. I think I lost my confidence.

Then I started working part-time for the Cheshire Association of Local Councils which provides training and guidance to town and parish councils in Cheshire.

Back then, we weren't offering a proper training programme and only 50 per cent of councils in Cheshire were members.

I helped to build the organisation until, six years later, it was able to support paying me a full-time wage.

At that point, I started earning a little bit more than my husband. That felt significant.

In charge: Jackie holding the famous Handforth parish council online meeting

The most expensive thing you have bought for fun?

It was an embossed black leather handbag for £585. I bought it five years ago and I still remember how much it cost. I really wanted it at the time, but I haven't used it in a while.

The best money decision you have made?

Taking out a timeshare. My husband and I used to be really bad at taking holidays. If left to our own devices, a whole year could slip by and we'd never quite get round to organising one.

Since we got our timeshare ten years ago, we have been on holiday every year because you have to pay the management fees whether you go or not.

We usually go to Tenerife for three weeks. We like the timeshare resorts – they are good value and it's an easy way to choose where to go on holiday. I'm not good with too much choice.

Do you save into a pension?

Not any more. I used to when I was in my 30s. I then realised that because we were going to inherit a farm in Cheshire from my husband's family, that would become our pension.

We sold the farm and invested the proceeds in the stock market. Since then, neither of us have needed to work, but I wouldn't know what to do with my life if I wasn't working.

Why do you invest in the stock market?

Banks are tight-fisted robbers. I don't appreciate the piddling rates of interest they magnanimously offer savers compared to what they charge borrowers.

Do you own any property?

Yes, a five-bedroom house in rural Shropshire.

We bought it seven years ago for £325,000 and have made lots of improvements, but I have no idea what it's worth now. I don't keep track of that.

If you were Chancellor what would you do?

I would give more funding to parish councils and offer their officers free training. The Government has reduced the funding to principal local authorities while setting the maximum amount they can raise through council tax.

Town and parish councils are picking up the slack for their local communities – funding anything from libraries to swimming pools and adult and children's social care. Yet they still don't get recognised for it.

What is your number one financial priority?

To make sure my children, who are now all in their 30s, are financially secure. I want to be able to leave them an inheritance – the way my parents and my husband's parents left us one.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's biggest banks are thrashing out a major deal to create hundreds of shared branches in towns and villages they have left behind, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Banks are in advanced talks about setting up community banking hubs to protect swathes of the country from being cut off and unable to access cash or stay on top of their day-to-day finances.

Sources said the banks are set to agree to a five-year deal to cover the costs of shared sites where customers of any large bank can pay in or withdraw cash and carry out transactions.

New beginning?: It is thought that every branch closure can save a bank up to £1million over five years

The only significant sticking point is a row over how much each bank will pay, an insider has revealed.

The Mail on Sunday has for decades called on banks to share sites as they have shut an increasing number of their least profitable branches across the country. Our Keep Our Cash campaign is calling for every town to have at least one bank.

Last night one source close to the discussions warned that banks may seize on the initiative and trigger a huge new wave of individual branch closures.

The source said it could give banks the perfect cover to reduce their overall networks closer to around 400 branches each. This is seen in the industry as the ideal size because it gives banks an outpost in all major population centres in Britain, the source said.

It is thought that every branch closure can save a bank up to £1million over five years. Lloyds currently has 1,567 branches, Barclays has 755, NatWest has 833, HSBC has 540 and Santander has 452.

If they slashed their networks to just 400 each, it would mean shutting as many as 2,147 branches between them.

They could then tell customers to use a much smaller number of shared banking hubs.

The MoS understands that the Financial Conduct Authority regulator is putting huge pressure on lenders to sign up to an agreement by Christmas – or potentially face tough legislation banning branch closures entirely.

The Post Office is overseeing a trial of shared bank branches, which ends next month.

Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, who sits on the influential Treasury Select Committee of MPs, said: 'When banks are in trouble, the taxpayers help them out, but when times are good they aren't there for their customers. Banks have recently announced a huge improvement in profits and I think it's time they stump up.'

Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays, Santander and NatWest have all been steadily chipping away at the size of their networks in recent years and Chancellor Rishi Sunak has promised to pass laws aimed at ensuring that everyone who relies on cash can access it.

Officials are understood to believe that a new generation of shared banking hubs is vital to protect vulnerable people from being left without access to banking altogether.

EY and Pinsent Masons have been advising banks in discussions. There are around 500 towns across the country that only have one bank branch left, according to research shared with the banks in discussions. The analysis found that between 150 and 200 locations would be severely cut off if the last branch in town was axed.

As a result, these areas are most likely to be in line for a shared banking hub.

The MoS understands that a community might qualify for a shared branch if it has a large population within about a mile and a quarter of the proposed site. There would also need to be a large number of people who rely on branches for banking.

Research provided to the banks by consultancy firm Frontier Economics has estimated that each shared branch would cost £250,000 to set up and run over five years.

The customers' banks might have to pay transaction fees estimated to be about £50,000 per year.

This would create a total cost of £100million for 200 sites, which the Treasury is calling on the big banks to fund.

But the banks are arguing about their share of the costs amid fears that these could spiral if more communities are later awarded a shared branch. Sparsely populated rural areas might fail to qualify for access to a banking hub as there may be too little demand to justify the running costs.

People in those places may instead be encouraged to access banking services through the 11,500-strong Post Office branch network.

A Treasury spokesman said it was consulting on new laws 'to make sure people only need to travel a reasonable distance to pay in or take out cash'. The spokesman said 'industry initiatives' would 'need to be compatible' with the legislation.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@British citizens, either born in America or to American parents, have been dealt a blow after a large wealth manager withdrew its services to 'US tax residents'.

Nutmeg, which has more than 140,000 clients, emailed affected customers last month, warning them it was closing their accounts.

The term 'US tax resident' includes people who live in the UK but were born in the US, and those who may never have set foot in the US, but have American parents.

Blow: Nutmeg, which has more than 140,000 clients, emailed affected customers last month, warning them it was closing their accounts

Nutmeg told The Mail on Sunday it was pulling out from providing Isas, pensions and investment accounts to about 350 people due to 'legal and regulatory complexities'.

The US is the only country in the world besides Eritrea that taxes non-resident citizens on their global income.

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), introduced in 2010, requires institutions to report the financial details of all their American clients – or risk being hit with large fines.

Nutmeg was one of the few remaining wealth managers offering accounts to US citizens living in the UK.

In 2018 it stopped accepting US tax residents as new customers, but continued to service existing accounts.

Now, though, it has also pulled the plug on these existing customers. The wealth manager said it was a 'very difficult decision' and was helping clients find an alternative investment provider.

It added that any customers who have renounced their US citizenship should get in touch about keeping their investments with them.

Nutmeg clients have reacted angrily to the news. Daniel Duckett, a pastry chef in Belfast – and a US tax resident – tweeted: 'I've been with Nutmeg for four years and suddenly they decide to stop me being a client.

'Why are banks able to discriminate in this way and get away with it? And what's nuts? The parent company is none other than US-based JPMorgan and [Nutmeg] recently embraced Fatca to attract more expats.'

JPMorgan Chase bought Nutmeg in June as part of its expansion into the UK banking and investment market. In 2016, Nutmeg declared it would accept US citizens living in the UK as clients.

Another customer, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was 'very surprised' to receive the email from Nutmeg.

The woman, who lives in the UK and has British and American nationality, opened a lifetime Isa with Nutmeg in 2017 as part of her retirement plan.

'It seemed the best option for me as I'm self-employed,' she said. 'I liked the fact that the Government put £1,000 in for every £4,000 I put in,' she said.

However, she now feels 'back at square one' and doesn't know how best to save for her retirement. She describes living in the UK with American citizenship as 'a minefield' due to the tax rules.

The US taxes people based on their citizenship rather than residence. Even green card holders, and socalled accidental Americans – those born in the US but who left as babies or toddlers – do not escape the reach of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), America's taxation authority.

Boris Johnson, who was born in New York but left when he was aged five, gave up his American citizenship after the US tried to tax him on the sale of his home in Islington, North London, in 2014 – a move he described at the time as 'absolutely outrageous'.

Those deemed to be US tax resident are liable for tax in America, regardless of where they live, and where the money is earned.

A double tax treaty means people won't be taxed twice, for example if they pay income tax on their earnings here, they won't have to pay a second lot of tax to the IRS.

However, it means that while Isas are tax-free in this country, they will be subject to tax on the other side of the Atlantic.

Alex Straight, a partner at accountant Blick Rothenberg, explained: 'The US won't care that your investments are wrapped up in a stocks and shares Isa.

'It just sees it as an investment account that you hold overseas and will tax you on it. This tax burden creates a real headache for Americans living here.'

According to Straight, investors holding certain funds in their Isas could be subject to punitive amounts of tax: 37 per cent plus interest depending on how long the investment has been held.

A source close to Three said the company was deliberating on whether to bring back the fees. The source said: 'They haven't committed either way at the moment.' Three could not be reached for comment.

Roaming charges were dropped when the UK was part of the EU, meaning customers could use their monthly allowance of calls, data and texts at no extra cost.

On the move: A source close to Three said the company was deliberating on whether to bring back roaming fees

Rival provider Vodafone announced last week that it would be reintroducing charges from January.

New and upgrading Vodafone customers travelling in the EU will be charged at least £1 a day to use their phone, with a maximum fee of £2.

Rival O2 said it 'currently has no plans' to change roaming charges across Europe.

The firm said earlier this year that customers travelling to the EU would be charged £3.50 for every gigabyte of data above 25GB.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sarah Ferguson has described her former mother-in-law the Queen as more of a mother to her than her own while speaking on a podcast.

The Duchess of York, 61, who divorced the Duke of York in 1996, has sparked a raft of royal scandals over the years, but said the monarch was her 'greatest mentor' and had always believed in her.

Speaking on the Tea with Twiggy podcast as she promoted her Mills & Boon romance novel Her Heart For A Compass, the duchess paid tribute to the Queen for being 'modern, flexible and forgiving.'

Sarah compared their relationship to the one she had with her own mother Susan Barrantes, who passed away in September 1998, saying: 'I think to myself that honestly my mother-in-law has been more of a mother to me than my mother.'

Her comments come days after she joined her ex-husband Prince Andrew at Balmoral to spend time with the Queen.

Fergie said: 'My greatest mentor and... person who believes in me is the Queen - and has never faltered.

'I absolutely admire the incredible way Her Majesty is so modern... and how flexible, and how understanding, and how forgiving and how generous.'

The duchess and ex-husband Andrew were said to have joined the Queen on holiday at Balmoral last week, hours after a civil lawsuit was filed against the duke over allegations of sexual abuse.

Andrew, who stepped down from royal duties in 2019, is being sued by Virginia Giuffre, who accuses him of sexually abusing her when she was a minor under US law after she was trafficked by billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Her comments come days after she joined her ex-husband Prince Andrew at Balmoral to spend time with the Queen

It is the duchess's first proper summer break at Balmoral since she was cast out of the royal family amid a toe-sucking scandal in the 1990s.

The Duke of Edinburgh, who died in April, reportedly refused to let his former daughter-in-law stay at the castle at the same time as him.

Sarah, in the podcast released on Monday, referred to Andrew as her 'lovely ex-husband' who 'always believes in me'.

She told model Twiggy, whose real name is Dame Lesley Lawson: 'I absolutely think there is no greater mentor because, from a little girl to now, the consistency of Her Majesty has been a great honour, it's a huge honour - makes me want to cry.'

The Duchess of York's mother (pictured) earned the nickname 'the bolter' and caused a stir in British social circles when she eloped with Argentinian polo player Hector Barrantes in 1975

The Duchess of York's mother earned the nickname 'the bolter' and caused a stir in British social circles when she eloped with Argentinian polo player Hector Barrantes in 1975, a year after her divorce from Fergie's father Sir Ronald Ferguson.

She was killed in a car crash in 1998 - the year after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.

Sir Ronald died in 2003 following a heart attack in Basingstoke, Hampshire.

But Emma Harrison has revealed she's firmly put her 'It girl' days behind her, after welcoming a daughter and finding a 'lovely new partner' to share her life with.

The actress and model, 47, told New Idea that while she has 'no regrets' about her past, she's now happier than ever raising a family and working as a property manager on the Gold Coast.

'Those were really fun days': Former Neighbours actress Emma Harrison says she has no regrets about her past modelling for lads' mags. Pictured in Los Angeles on February 7, 2006

'Those were really fun, exciting days... but at this stage in my life, family and being a mum are more important to me,' she said.

'I did have a fun time overseas and I don't have any regrets by any means, but everything happens for a reason and that reason ended.'

Emma starred on Neighbours from 1995 to 1997, before landing small roles in Hollywood movies such as Intolerable Cruelty, The Company and Street Fighter.

Emma got engaged to her partner Cade in June last year, announcing the happy news on Facebook.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Comedian Larry David says he was thrilled to be axed from Barack Obama's 60th birthday party guest list over fears he'd be asked to perform a live routine.

The Curb Your Enthusiasm star, 74, shared how he surprised the party planner by reacting with delight on being told he'd been cut from the guest list.

In Maureen Dowd's latest column for The New York Times, the Seinfeld co-creator shared why he was so glad when Obama's assistant cancelled his invitation to the party.

'I was pretty glum when I finally called back his assistant,'

'When he told me I was eighty-sixed from the party, I was so relieved I screamed, 'Thank you! Thank you!' He must have thought I was insane,'

'Then I hung up the phone, poured myself a drink and finished my crossword puzzle,' Dowd quoted him saying.

David, who was at his home on the island, went on to say that he figured he was going to be asked to perform comedy at the bash.

Dreading to prepare a routine just three days before the party, David said news that he was no longer welcome at the party were music to his ears.

Obama's birthday bash, which boasted A-list celebrity guests such as John Legend, Jay-Z and Beyoncé and was celebrated at the Obamas' $12million compound in Martha's Vineyard, was initially planned to have a 600-person guest list.

But amid backlash that his party would be a 'super-spreader' event as the country saw a rise on cases of the Delta Variant, Obama scaled back his invitations.

Many were reportedly hurt by the decision and David was perhaps the only uninvited guest who reacted not only relieved, but thrilled, to have been left out.

Comedian Larry Kennedy (pictured) told NYT columnist Maureen Dowd that he was relived to have been uninvited to president Obama's controversial 60th birthday bash

In her column 'Behold Barack Antoinette,' Dowd was critical of Obama for axing people who helped him to the top from his lavish 60th birthday guest list in favor of A-list stars

Talk-show hosts such as Stephen Colbert, Conan O'Brien and David Letterman, and Obama's former advisors such as his campaign chief strategist David Axelrod and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel were erased from the final list. But Dowd focuses her criticism on Obama's treatment of the latter group, arguing that he chose celebrities over administration staff and politicians who helped him rise to become the 44th president of the United States.

Dowd compares Obama to F Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby, arguing that while the fictional character wanted to impress Daisy, his love interest, with a lavish celebration, Obama threw a party because 'being cool is important to him.'

'One difference is that Gatsby opened his house to the uninvited. Obama closed his house to many of the invited after getting flak for hosting 'a celebrity mosh pit,' as Stephen Colbert called it, while officials were telling people to mask back up.'

Dowd went on to condemn Obama's passive nature throughout his presidency, and his current seemingly fascination with the entertainment industry, citing the deal between his production company and Netflix to work on several documents and movies, his podcast with Bruce Springsteen and the book adaptation.

David (pictured) told Dowd that he feared he was going to be asked to perform a comedy routine

Dreading to prepare a routine just three days before the party, the assistant's call was sweet as honey to his ears

The former president disinvited his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel and chief campaign strategist David Axelrod. Dowd argues they were fundamental during his presidency and yet were replaced on his party by A-list celebrities

She also called Obama 'Barack Antoinette,' likening his ostentatious and 'new-rich' celebration to those of the infamous fallen queen of France.

Former staff who were disinvited are reportedly extremely hurt to have seen VIP personalities like John Legend and George Clooney, celebrating with who once was their boss, and close friend.

Dowd saying the lavish display was also damaging to the Democrat party as a whole.

She explained: 'The party crystallized the caricature of the Democratic Party that Joe Biden had to fight against in order to get elected,

'It was as far from Flint and Scranton as you can imagine: an orgy of the 1 percent — private jets, Martha’s Vineyard, limousine liberals and Hollywood whoring.'

Some guests cracked jokes about being cut from the guest list, with Caroline Kennedy telling the Times: 'I would have disinvited me if I was him.'

Dowd speculated that some of the wisecracks had been deployed in a bid to mask guests' hurt feelings.

According to a statement obtained by Fox, the Obamas reduced the guest list to include 'only family and close friends.'

'President Obama is appreciative of others sending their birthday wishes from afar and looks forward to seeing people soon,' said Hannah Hankins, a spokeswoman for Obama.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's biggest wind turbine factory in Hull will double in size following a £186million upgrade.

The investment by Siemens in Alexandra Dock, Hull, means the facility can make next-generation turbines, as well as blades more than 330 feet long.

These will be used in huge wind farms currently under construction in the North Sea and at other sites abroad.

The Alexander Dock factory in Hull is to build next generation turbines for windfarms currently being built in the North Sea (pictured) after owner Siemens announced a £186m upgrade

It is a major boost to the UK's green power industry and will create about 200 jobs, while supporting a further 1,000 existing roles.

Manufacturer GRI Renewable Industries yesterday also announced plans for a £78million wind turbine tower factory in Hull, taking the total of new investments to £264million. GRI's factory is expected to create another 260 jobs.

The companies are both set to receive grant funding from a £160million Government pot to support offshore wind, although details of how much each will get have yet to be finalised.

The deals come as Government is driving a nationwide push to transition to greener sources of energy and make Britain a world leader in the field. It is hoped they will also support the Government's levelling up agenda.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said yesterday's announcement was part of the UK's 'green industrial revolution'.

Alexandra Dock is already the UK's biggest wind turbine factory and opened in 2016.

Under the plans, the factory will more than double in size, from almost 120,000 sq ft to nearly 260,000 sq ft.

Construction work for its Hull factory's expansion is expected to begin within weeks and finish in 2023.

Last month SeAH Wind and Smulders Projects UK announced separate investments in Hull and Newcastle, respectively.

SeAH will build a £117million factory to build foundations known as 'monopiles' for wind turbines, while Smulders has announced a £70million upgrade of their site that makes 'transition' pieces for foundations.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Standing half-way up the staircase, I looked down at my husband, Rob, who was ankle-deep in water in our hallway.

Fearful the rising water could affect the electrics at any moment, I realised it was time to evacuate our children.

It was late June on a Friday night and our home in Solihull, West Midlands, had been flooded by a freak storm. The battle to prevent it zapped all our energy. But our fight was far from over, and no one dared exhale until we knew what our insurer had to say.

Escape: Laura Shannon and daughters Orlagh, left, and Maddie, were forced to flee their home in Solihull after a freak storm sparked flash floods

Every pound of damage needed to be meticulously totted up.

I have no idea exactly how much it will cost to replace each item lost and every square foot of damaged flooring, but we’re looking at a five-figure bill.

And I have learned to my cost (literally) that even with home insurance, you can still end up thousands of pounds out of pocket.

Every year, scores of homeowners are caught out by insurance quirks, often buried in the small print. This was my year to be snared.

I had paid about £300 for home contents and buildings cover with HomeProtect. As a personal finance journalist, I was careful to check the policy for glaring loopholes.

I knew the excess (what we’d have to pay before our insurer stepped in) was a couple of hundred pounds. But, in fact, there was also a separate £2,500 compulsory flooding excess, which, when added to the £250 voluntary excess for the building cover, meant I was down £2,750 before we even started the clean-up.

This figure is perfectly visible on my policy document, but I hadn’t given it a second thought. We don’t live near water, our home is raised above ground level, and it has never flooded before.

Yet floods are becoming increasingly common, with one in six homes in the UK now at risk. Just last month the Government announced a record £5.2 billion investment in flood defences over the next six years. A new flood insurance directory will also be launched this autumn to help more homeowners find cover.

The Met Office says that rainfall exceeding 30mm per hour means flash flooding is likely. At its worst moment, rainfall reached 165 mm per hour over my house. Later, in just one hour, 60 mm cascaded down.

Our daughters, Orlagh, four, and Maddie, one, were asleep upstairs at the time, unaware of their parents’ frantic bid to save the family belongings.

We put every towel we own against doors and moved stores of fresh water and food upstairs in case we became trapped with an infected water supply.

Swamped: The property, which had never flooded before and is not near any rivers, lakes or the sea, and raised above ground level, was left under several feet of water

My husband fought valiantly against a tide — strong enough to carry a tree stump from the back of our garden to our driveway — to rip off the side-gate and alleviate pressure from the swell in our garden.

With cut and bruised legs, he then waded through waist-height water to check on elderly neighbours.

The fire service and police arrived. One neighbour had to be rescued by boat.

We had sprung into action a little before 9pm. By midnight, with my toddler strapped to my back, I was wading out to my parents’ car on higher ground.

It was a surreal moment. Another came soon after, when I fell victim to yet more insurance small print.

The definition of ‘outbuilding’, which in my mind meant the shed, also includes garden fences, driveways and patios, we were told.

This meant the £7,500 of cover we had deemed more than adequate left us under-insured.

As a result, our insurer will only cover about half of any claim for a deck clean or a new shed, leaving us further out of pocket.

The house always wins, it seems. The insurer’s that is.

Our separate flood excess of £2,500 is also deemed very high compared with other policies.

Even homes in flood risk areas covered under the Government’s Flood Re scheme, which aims to make cover affordable, are typically charged an excess of about £250, according to Brian Brown, of data analysts Defaqto.

Yet we were fortunate in some ways as many cheaper insurers do not cover flooding at all.

Others are caught out because they fail to tell their insurers about the flood immediately, and before carrying out repairs. Thankfully I did this.

It’s also important to take photos of damage as it happens. But even having done things right, I almost certainly face a costly renewal premium.

Customers can pay nearly a fifth more for home insurance for living close to water. An average policy is about £193 a year for living within 150 metres of water, according to price comparison website GoCompare. Those more than 400 metres away pay an average £161.

And once a flood has occurred, the average policy can more than double from £132 to £313 a year, Moneysupermarket says.

Roger Flaxman, of insurance disputes specialist Flaxman Partners, adds: ‘We’re going to go through a winter where flooding could become more prolific. Check whether flooding is included or excluded in your policy. If not, you need to buy it.’

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Money Mail readers today tell ministers loud and clear that laws are needed now to save our cash.

We asked you to contribute to the Government’s crucial consultation on cash — and were overwhelmed by your response.

We have packaged up hundreds of your heartfelt letters and emails and sent them in a powerful dossier to the Treasury to ensure your voices are heard.

Threat: We asked you to contribute to the Government’s crucial consultation on cash - and were overwhelmed by your response.

For years, campaigners have been warning about the decline of coins and notes and how the elderly and vulnerable risked being cut off from cash.

In the meantime, ATMs have been turned off, banks have continued to axe hundreds of branches, Post Offices are under threat and now shops are refusing to accept cash.

Your message to the Government was clear: we must not delay introducing laws to protect cash and those who rely on it.

Grandparents told us how they cherish giving pocket money to their grandchildren, while carers of those with learning disabilities say they could not get by without it.

Others in their 80s and 90s say they do not feel comfortable using cards at this stage of their lives.

Some of the most distressing letters came from people who have lost their local bank branch. They now face long car or bus journeys to the nearest bank, while the most vulnerable say they have been forced to rely on carers to access their own money.

It has been almost 18 months since Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged new laws to protect cash while millions still rely on it.

And last month the Government finally began consulting on new legislation to halt the endless stream of closures.

These may include giving the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) the power to block banks from closing branches in communities which are dependent on them.

And nine in ten neighbourhoods could get the legal right to have somewhere to withdraw cash for free no more than 1km away.

But experts warn new laws could take at least two years to enforce — leaving scores of towns and villages at risk of becoming cash deserts.

I don't know what dad would do without it 'Ignored': World War II veteran George Armitt relies on cash and cheques to pay for everything At 94, World War II veteran George Armitt relies on cash and cheques to pay for everything. But the great-grandfather-of-12 now has to ask his 57-year-old son Jonathan to withdraw cash for him. George (pictured with late wife José) is a NatWest customer and lives in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire — but his nearest branch is two miles away and he is now too frail to make the journey. And while George could visit an ATM to take out cash, he prefers ‘face-to-face’ contact over self-service machines. In fact, Jonathan only helped him apply for his first debit card a few months ago, when George found out he could no longer use his Post Office card to withdraw cash from his pension. Jonathan, his full-time carer, says: ‘I am concerned about what would happen if he used a debit card himself and entered his PIN incorrectly.’ And as he approaches his 95th birthday this month, George feels ignored by the Government and his bank. He says: ‘They only listen to the customers who are comfortable with tech. I don’t trust banks any more, as all they think about is their profit.’ Jonathan believes the Financial Conduct Authority should oversee a transparent consultation process if a bank wants to close a branch. ‘It should intervene if a small community is going to be badly affected.’

Bank branch betrayal

Many readers say bank branches are the only places they feel comfortable taking out cash.

But more than 4,200 have shut for good since 2015 — with 801 closing since the first lockdown and another 103 set to go this year, says consumer group Which?

Under FCA guidelines, banks and building societies have to demonstrate that they have considered the impact axing a branch could have on their customers’ needs.

But there is nothing to stop them going ahead with a closure. And with many banks keen to save on overheads, they often plough ahead, blaming low footfall as more customers sign up for online banking.

Gill Harris, who cares for two sons with learning disabilities, has to drive more than 20 miles to visit her nearest Barclays branch. Steven, 52, and Richard, 50, cannot use cards and rely on coins and notes to pay for activities at their local day centre.

It used to take the former Barclays cashier just nine minutes to get to her nearest branch in Needham Market — five miles from her home in Claydon, Suffolk.

But the branch shut in 2014, forcing her to drive to the next nearest branch in Stowmarket, a 15-minute drive away.

Since that closed last month, Gill, 75, a widow, has to drive to Bury St Edmunds — a one-hour round trip. She says: ‘It makes me so angry — banks aren’t thinking of their customers, only profits.’

Ministers are consulting on giving the FCA powers which could include the ability to fine banks if they axe vital branches — in areas with few places residents can take out cash — or prevent closures.

It’s a proposal Jim Storey, 67, a trustee of the Lions Club of Fleet, supports. The club helps low-income residents in the Hampshire town.

Jim wrote to HSBC when he heard its branch was closing. It meant volunteers would have to drive ten miles away with up to £30,000 in cash after hosting events.

But Jim never got a reply and the branch closed in June.

Lifeline: For years, campaigners have been warning about the decline of coins and notes and how the elderly and vulnerable risked being cut off from cash

He says: ‘If banks are no longer serving customers, then giving a watchdog the legal right to stop them is the only solution.’

Age UK, which campaigns for older people, is one of several charities calling for new laws to strengthen the FCA’s powers.

Director Caroline Abrahams says: ‘The tsunami of branch closures and rapid move towards online and mobile banking, has been detrimental to many older people’s financial independence.

‘The Government must consider new legislation to protect people’s access to their money.’

A Barclays spokesman says it would be in touch with Gill to see how it could support her family.

HSBC says it is sorry if Jim did not receive a reply from the bank.

Withdrawal of the ATMs

Thousands of ATMs were closed during lockdown when the businesses they were based in or near closed their doors.

And just under 4,000 are yet to reopen, according to the UK’s largest ATM network Link.

And of the cash machines left, one in four charge a fee of up to £2 to make a withdrawal.

Link has committed to protecting free ATMs that are more than 1km away from somewhere else customers can access cash fee-free. But some readers say this is not enough.

David Richardson, 77, lives in a Shropshire town with one bank branch, a Post Office and two ATMs. Sometimes, he is unable to take cash out of one ATM because it is empty.

David, a retired IT worker, says: ‘It is obviously over used, so I would think that one free cash machine for every 1km of land would not be enough.’

And while cash machines in bank branches often allow customers to pay in notes, most ATMS do not.

I’ve lost my local branch twice now Retired primary school teacher Jane has to drive six miles to visit her nearest NatWest branch. Jane Prowse, a retired primary school teacher, switched banks twice after branch closures. But three years ago, the last bank in her Devon town of Bovey Tracey closed its doors and now Jane has to drive six miles to Newton Abbott to visit her nearest NatWest branch. Jane (pictured with her dog, Layla) has no idea what she will do if she has to surrender her driving licence. The 77-year-old, who lives with husband Clive, 71, uses cash and cheques to pay for almost everything — and after a friend came close to being scammed, she is keen to stick to what she knows. The former HSBC customer switched to NatWest several years ago, but it later shut its doors and then Lloyds swiftly followed suit in 2018. Jane says: ‘I do feel let down by the Government and the banks — I think a lot of other elderly people feel the same. ‘This consultation comes too late for people like me, when all of the banks have already left us.’ She adds: ‘Ideally, the banks will start bringing back branches to where they are needed, rather than just sticking to the status quo.’

Protect our post offices

Countless readers hailed their local Post Office as a safe and convenient place to access cash.Customers of most banks have been able to withdraw and deposit coins and notes there since 2017.

Around 95 per cent of the population lives within a mile of a Post Office, so most should have one within walking distance.

A retired nurse told us her Post Office in Stanton, a village near Bury St Edmunds, is ‘vital to all’.

Beryl, 76, says: ‘The Post Office is a valued service because so many of us rely on cash.’

However, the services provided at the Post Office rely on the banks to subsidise them, and in 2019 Barclays tried to pull out of its Banking Framework agreement.

It gave in to a hard-fought campaign by Money Mail and reversed the decision. However, the agreement remains voluntary.

Time to act is running out

Cash use has been declining for some time, as more people rely on cards and contactless payments methods instead.

The pandemic accelerated this trend further, with many shops refusing to accept cash for fear of spreading the virus through contaminated notes and coins.

A Money Mail poll earlier this year found one in five shoppers had been barred from paying this way since non-essential retailers re-opened in April.

This is despite research published by the Bank of England last year stating that shoppers were at low risk of catching the virus from touching cash.

Priceless: Your message for the Government over its crucial consultation on cash was clear -we cannot afford to delay introducing laws to protect it and those who rely on it

Many readers say they fear being left behind. Cliff Gilbert, 66, is the treasurer of his village hall in Gayton, Staffordshire.

He helps to run around 20 events each year, including pop-up cafes and community bar nights.

But as the hall has no broadband and a very poor mobile signal, Cliff and his colleagues are not able to process card payments.

‘The removal of cash as a payment option for the future would threaten the survival of our village hall,’ he writes.

Natalie Ceeney, author of the Access To Cash Review, says: ‘We know that between five and eight million people still need cash.

‘The infrastructure needed to support it is already starting to crumble.’

Last year, just 17 per cent of payments were made with cash, down from 35 per cent in 2019.

The Treasury’s consultation on cash closes on September 23. But campaigners warn we need to make faster progress.

Ministers have known that Britain is at risk of sleepwalking into a cashless society since Ms Ceeney’s Access to Cash Review in 2019.

And Baroness (Ros) Altmann, a former pensions minister, says: ‘It is very unlikely that these laws will come into place for at least two years — that would be 2023 at the earliest.

By then, many more bank branches may have closed down, so the Government should make sure we return to the cash access we have today and not how it will be then.’

James Murray, the Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, says: ‘We know this kind of consultation has been needed for years, so why is the Government only starting it now?

‘Even as overall cash use declines, it will still be a vital means of payment for many people.’

A Treasury spokesman says: We know that cash remains vital for millions of people and we are committed to protecting access to cash across the UK.

‘That’s why we are consulting on proposals for new laws to make sure people only need to travel a reasonable distance to pay in or take out cash.’

On the face of things, this 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa looks good value with an asking price of £95,000. But all is not as it seems.

That's because this is the new Testa Rossa J - 'J' standing for Junior - produced by The British Little Car Company and it is a three-quarter scale replica with an electric motor.

It's fully endorsed by the fabled exotic car brand with the rampaging stallion badge and comes with an electric motor with a top speed of 'over' 37mph.

Aimed at teenagers with super-rich parents, it rings in at the same price as a number of used Ferraris from the last 30 years, including barely-used examples of the F355, 360 Modena and 599 GTB.

The £95,000 Ferrari for teenagers: The Italian brand has this week unveiled one of the most expensive toys on the planet - a replica 1957 250 Testa Rossa electric car

This is possibly not the first time you've seen a scale replica electric car for kids from The Little Car Company, as they've collaborated with a number of exotic car makers on supremely-pricey junior models in recent years.

This Ferrari Testa Rossa J is said to be aimed at young drivers over the age of 14.

It has been jointly designed by the Italian manufacturer’s Maranello styling centre in partnership with the British specialist firm using original design drawings held by Ferrari’s Classiche department.

It measures in at 3,100mm long, 1,100mm wide and 700mm tall. That means it's longer than a Smart ForTwo, so you'll definitely need a garage or large shed to keep it (not that anyone who can afford a £95,000 electric toy car doesn't have one of those).

Mini me: The model, built in Bicester, is a three-quarter replica of the real thing, though without the thumping V12 engine

Ferrari has partnered with British junior-model specialists, The Little Car Company, to produce 299 of the like-for-like replicas

The 250 Testa Rossa J is powered by an electric motor and three batteries at the front. They combine to provide 55 miles of driving range

Customers will be able to choose a selection of race liveries or certified Ferrari body colours - as well as a heap of extra features

Out goes the roaring 3.0-litre V12 engine from the genuine race car and in comes an electric motor powered by three batteries located at the front of the car.

Like other junior creations from The Little Car Company, it has different driving modes: Novice, Comfort, Sport and Race.

Even in its most aggressive set-up the maximum speed is restricted to 'over 60kmh, so around 37mph, and driving around 56 miles will empty a fully-charged battery.

The batteries can be recharged via the replica fuel filler car.

Inside, the car gets full leather upholstery and a vintage-style steering wheel produced by Nardi, which is the same supplier for the original 250 Testa Rossa some 64 years ago. The pedal box is from the F8 Tributo supercar

The Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa J has four driving modes - the least powerful setting is 'Novice', which offer a limited top speed of 12mph. Both the 'Sport' and 'Race' settings provide maximum power and a top speed in excess of 37mph

Ferrari says even drivers as young as 14 should be as safe as houses driving one.

'Safety has been a priority throughout the car’s development: the metal side panels were reinforced and an optional roll-bar can be anchored to the chassis,' it said.

Will it fit in my play room? The Little Car Company Ferrari Testa Rossa J Price: from €93,000 before tax (approx £95,000 UK) Production: 299 units built in Bicester, UK Dimensions: Length: 3.1 metres Width: 1.1 metres Height: 700cm Powertrain: Single electric motor, 3x batteries Range: 90km (56 miles) Driving modes and top speed Novice: 20kmh (12mph) Comfort: 45kmh (28mph) Sport: over 60kmh (37mph) Race: over 60 kmh (37mph) Tyres and wheels: 12 inch wheels based on the original Borrani rims (genuine Borrani rims also available at extra cost) and Pirelli Cinturato

'Brembo disc brakes replace the original drum system to maximize braking performance, and these are complemented by a hydraulic handbrake.'

Why is it so expensive, you might ask?

As well as sporting the Ferrari badge and having a hand-beaten alumimium body, it also shares some of its components with the legendary maker's full-size cars.

The pedal box - consisting of a throttle and brake - is the same as that fitted to the F8 Tributo supercar, while the tyres wrapping its 12-inch wheels are supplied by Ferrari's type partner Pirelli.

Suspension is taken care of with Bilstein coilover dampers and custom springs which were fine-tuned and signed off by Ferrari’s test divers at the Fiorano test track.

Like most electric and hybrid cars on the market today, it has regenerative brakes that pump a little energy back into the battery when the car is decellerating.

The cabin also gets full leather upholstering and a classic steering wheel made by Nardi - the same company that supplied the part for the original 1957 model.

There's a vintage instrument cluster redesigned to display EV information, such as remaining driving range and temperatures for the battery and electric motor.

Just 299 examples are due to be produced with customers able to customise their cars, with a choice of 14 historic race liveries and 53 bodywork colours that have graced Ferrari vehicles over the generations.

Prices start from €93,000 before taxes, shipping and optional features are included.

That works out today at around £78,600. With VAT, that's almost £95,000.

It's certainly a lot of money to pay for what is essentially a toy but it's nowhere near as expensive as the real thing.

With just 34 examples built, the 250 TR genuine article will be a prize car in any collection.

The most expensive sold at auction went for £9million in 2011 and £8million in 2009 - the latter of which the Daily Mail had an exclusive drive in. Inflation adjusted, that works out at £11.8million and £11million respectively.

This is the second most expensive genuine Ferrari 250 TR sold at auction. It went under the hammer in 2009 with a winning bid of £8million. Inflation adjusted, that works out at £11million today. (Picture courtesy of RM Sotheby's and Darin Schnabel)

The vintage-style clocks in the toy version have been modified to provide electric vehicle information, such as remaining range and battery temperature

Suspension is taken care of with Bilstein coilover dampers and custom springs which were fine-tuned and signed off by Ferrari’s test divers at the Fiorano test track

Five used Ferraris you can grab for the same price as the Testa Rossa J

If you chose to spend your £95,000 on a full-size second-hand Ferrari instead, you could get your hands on some impressive motors indeed.

To see which Italian stallions were listed for the same price, This is Money took to used car listings.

A quick scan of Auto Trader showed the same outlay could land you a 2008 599 GTB F1 Fiorano with a six-litre V12 motor under the bonnet that produces 612bhp and has just over 28,000 miles on the clock.

Or how about a 2007 F430 Spider F1? You can grab a V8-powered, 4.3-litre, 193mph open-top beauty for £95,000 with a mere 11,000 miles on the clock.

Which used Ferraris could you pick up for £95,000? How about this 2008 599 GTB F1 Fiorano (left) or how about a 2007 F430 Spider F1 (right) with a mere 11,000 miles on the clock?

Also for a similar price you can travel back three decades in time to pick up a 1988 328 3.2 GTS convertible with just less than 26,000 miles covered in its lifetime.

Our top picks, if given £95,000 to spend on a second-hand Ferrari, would be one of these next two cars.

The first is a one-owner-from-new 360 Modena F1 currently for sale with less than 3,000 miles covered since 2000.

Or, if we wanted to live out our Out Run arcade fantasies from the nineties, a 1998 R-reg F355 Berlinetta GTB with 34,000 miles clocked in 23 years.

Whichever one of these five cars you choose, they will definitely offer more than 37mph flat out.

An outlay of £95k will get you a 1988 328 3.2 GTS convertible with just less than 26,000 miles covered in its lifetime (left). This 1998 R-reg F355 Berlinetta GTB (right) with 34,000 miles clocked in 23 years also costs the same as the new toy replica
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Football may not have made it home but you could still find a place for sport in your investment portfolio.

From teams to sponsorship brands and gym equipment, there are plenty of ways to invest in sport.

As with any investments, a diverse portfolio is essential, so don't just back sport related firms - make them part of your wider investing strategy if you are interested.

Here is how to kick off the sports investment part of your portfolio.

Investors could gain exposure by backing sports science businesses or even the companies competing for broadcast rights

How to invest in sport

Sport has become big business. It's no longer just about football matches or races but sponsorship and TV rights.

Take football, for example. Results are important on the pitch but teams rely on revenue from broadcasting deals, sponsorship and media work.

Speaking on a recent eToro webinar, former England and Manchester United defender Gary Neville said there has been a major shift in football during his career, which ran from 1994 to 2011.

Invest in the sports you love webinar This is Money editor Simon Lambert, England legend Gary Neville, Formula E champion Antonio Felix da Costa and eToro analyst Adam Vettese discuss the parallels between investing and sport, while taking a closer look at some of the top sports brands which are making the news and why. Check out the webinar here. The content that will be discussed is intended for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or investment recommendation.

This includes a move towards sports science and nutrition as well as more demand for content.

He says: 'The content demand from football players in the 1990s may have been the odd interview but now there is social media, club channels, magazines. It is continuous and constant.'

Neville says marketing and PR has become a core part of the business of running a football club.

Investors could gain exposure to this area by backing sports science businesses or even the companies competing for broadcast rights such as BT and Amazon.

You can also invest in some of the top football teams.

Manchester United is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and you will also find Scottish Giants Celtic on the London Stock Exchange and Roma, Juventus, and Lazio on Italy’s stockmarket.

Additionally, football fans can invest in Borussia Dortmund in Germany or Ajax in The Netherlands.

The performance of these companies on the stock market will be dictated by more than just how they perform on the pitch.

It will be influenced by sponsorship deals, the talent a team attracts as well as external factors such as the behaviour of players, fans or being unable to welcome crowds such as during the pandemic.

Football players and teams will also have deals with sporting and fashion brands such as Nike and Adidas, both of which are publicly listed companies.

Football isn’t the only sport that investors can make money from, though. Motor racing fans can invest in Formula One.

This could be done by backing car manufacturers behind the teams such as Ferrari, Mercedes (under Daimler AG) and Renault as well as the Liberty Formula One Group, which runs the sport.

Formula E is also growing in popularity. The sport focuses on drivers and teams with electric cars.

Current FIA Formula E Drivers' Champion António Félix da Costa said in the eToro webinar that the sport is showcasing what manufacturers and car brands, such as BMW, are doing with electric vehicles that are now being used in the real world as the UK moves away from petrol and diesel engines.

It's also a chance for emerging electric car brands such as Nio to show what they can do and investors can also back them on the stock market.

Yet there are still more ways to invest beyond the football pitch and the racetrack.

Keep an eye on sport and fitness trends

Adam Vettese, a market analyst for eToro, says investors can try to spot trends early to get the best profits.

For example, Nasdaq-listed exercise bike maker Peloton became a stay-at-home stock during the pandemic as gyms were closed and people took to exercising from home.

Peloton’s share price was $29 when it listed on the Nasdaq in September 2019 and was at $119 as of 22 July. A $100 investment made in September 2019 would now be worth $410- a 310 per cent gain. The stock is up 96.61 per cent based on its one-year performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.

He says: 'Often there is a mental barrier to investing. You don’t need an economics degree. It can be fairly simple, for example, if people are going to be working at home then something like Peloton is going to be successful.

'You just have to work out how that translates into stock market movements.'

How to choose a sporting stock

The same investing rules apply when choosing sporting stocks. Vettese says the main factors are fundamental and technical analysis.

Fundamental analysis means looking at the value of the company, its profits, assets, how its industry is performing and how the stock compares.

The technical side includes looking at the historical share price of a company and assessing if history will repeat itself.

Vettese of eToro says: 'The most important thing is to invest in something you believe in.

'Something that is driving your own consumer decisions can often make good logic for your investor decisions.'

A game of two halves

You wouldn’t fill a football team with attackers and no defensive players.

Similarly, with a sport-focused part of an investment portfolio it helps to be diverse by including different types of businesses.

This way, if one stock does badly, the wider portfolio could be supported by potentially better performance of other investments.

For example, Peloton’s stock performed well during national lockdowns, but it has dropped off as gyms reopened and demand for home workouts reduced.

Vettese adds: 'Diversifying across different industries lets you ride out unforeseen events in the market and it also allows you to account for changes you have no control over such as interest rates.

'It is really important at an industry level to have a spread of stocks including those that grow and others that generate an income through a dividend.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A highly-anticipated auction to buy inhaler maker Vectura was dramatically called off at the eleventh hour last night.

Tobacco giant Philip Morris International (PMI) and American private equity firm The Carlyle Group had been preparing to go head-to-head in a five-day bidding war, starting today, for FTSE 250-listed company Vectura.

The pair had been putting in offers for the company since May but had reached a deadlock.

Tobacco giant Philip Morris and American private equity firm The Carlyle Group had been preparing to go head-to-head in a five-day bidding war for FTSE 250-listed company Vectura

This led all three groups to agree to a rare auction process, overseen by the Takeover Panel, which aimed to wrap up the saga.

But with just 27 minutes to go before a 5pm deadline, Carlyle withdrew from the battle by declaring its latest offer of 155p per share was the highest that it would go, scuppering the need for an auction.

Carlyle made the approach, which values Vectura at £958million, last Friday. But less than 48 hours later PMI leapfrogged it with a 165p offer, valuing the company at £1.02billion.

All eyes are now on Vectura’s board which will need to weigh up the two bids.

If it goes with Carlyle, the private equity group will need to gain support from 75 per cent of shareholders.

If PMI is successful, it will only need backing from 50 per cent after it changed the structure of its offer.

Based in the Wiltshire town of Chippenham, Vectura specialises in making inhalers and nebulisers.

The company also works with pharmaceutical companies such as Hikma and Glaxosmithkline to convert their medicines into powders that can be inhaled.

Its profile has been raised during the pandemic by its work with Inspira Pharmaceuticals to develop a Covid vaccine.

The race to buy Vectura has been one of the most controversial takeover battles in recent years.

On the one hand fears have been raised in the City that Carlyle’s interest means that it could become the latest in a string of companies to fall prey to a private equity buyout.

But the swoop by Marlboro cigarette maker PMI triggered outrage from health campaigners and politicians.

PMI says it is trying to transform into a health and wellness company as it moves away from tobacco.

The American Lung Association said it was ‘reprehensible’ that a cigarette maker that has profited from damaging people’s lungs could buy a company that treats them.

Health experts have warned that Vectura could be blocked from taking part in research programmes with universities if it is bought by PMI.

Carlyle emphasised these points last night, saying that it believed its lower offer still provided the biggest benefits to ‘Vectura and its broader stakeholders’.

It added that it believed its tie-up would offer ‘significant opportunity to Vectura’s many employees (particularly Vectura’s leading scientists), suppliers, customers and research partners’.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tomorrow, school leavers across the country will find out their A-Level results and, more importantly, where they'll be heading to University.

There are now estimated to be 2.5 million students enrolled at UK higher education institutions, according to Universities UK.

With many learning to manage serious amounts of money for the first time, this is big business for banks.

So as the start of the new academic year draws near, they are once again battling it out to woo freshers and undergraduates alike into opening an account with them.

Do your homework: Young adults starting university are eligible for a student account that often comes with benefits and interest-free overdrafts

They might not be stashing away savings right now, but banks are keen to snap up today's students because, when they hopefully start earning graduate salaries, they can be valuable customers for decades to come.

Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: 'Student account providers have not held back with tweaking their perks this year, which are enticing and could save students some cash.

'Unlike last year, two banks are offering a free cash incentive upon opening, namely HSBC with £80 and NatWest with £50, which was unheard of in 2020 for student accounts.

'Since the last academic year there is a better variety of perks, so students can debate which type of account will give them the most value based on their spending habits.'

Students can therefore find plenty of cost-saving perks - but they would be wise to consider which account best suits their spending habits before committing.

Things like overdraft limits, interest charges and overseas transaction fees can all make a dent in their budget if they are caught unawares.

This is Money has balanced the perks and the terms and conditions to pick out some of the best options for those heading to university next month.

What are the perks?

Students can benefit from a free 12-month subscription to Perlego – an online library containing over 500,000 academic and non-fiction books.

A Perlego subscription usually costs £96 a year, so this could be a considerable bonus for a student looking to save some money on study materials.

Most banks either prevent students from exceeding their arranged overdraft limit or wont charge them for doing so - but it's important to double check to avoid any nasty surprises

The Barclays app also gives you lots of ways to track your spending – for example, allowing you to compare how much you spend at shops and other businesses month by month.

How big is the overdraft?

Barclays provides an interest-free buffer of £500 during the first term.

But this increases up to £1,000 in the first year and then up to £2,000 in Year two and finally up to £3,000 in the third year and beyond.

Barclays does not offer unarranged overdrafts, so you will not be able to exceed your overdraft limit.

What to watch out for

When using your Barclays debit card abroad you'll be hit with a 2.99 per cent transaction fee for any payment or cash withdrawal.

Can I apply?

To apply you'll need to be at least 18 and in full-time higher education, or a higher apprenticeship (level 4+).

What are the perks?

Students can earn up to 15 per cent cashback at selected retailers, including the Co-op, Costa and Sky, simply by registering for Everyday Offers via their online banking.

The account also comes with promotional code that will enable students to enjoy a free TOTUM card for up to three years.

A TOTUM card gives students access to over 350 UK discounts on the high street and online at places like the Co-op, Fender, Halfords, Garmin, Odeon and Grenade.

The card would otherwise cost £24.99 for the same time period.

The account also comes with a free International Student Identity Card, allowing access to over 150,000 international discounts in over 130 countries including numerous London tourist attractions.

How big is the overdraft?

Students can get up to £1,500 in years 1-3 and up to £2,000 in years 4-6.

The overdraft starts at £500 for the first six months, then you can apply to increase it to £1,000 in months seven to nine, and up to £1,500 from month ten.

Unarranged overdraft requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and, where they are authorised, no charges are applied.

What to watch out for

Students may decide to look for the biggest fee-free overdraft they can find if they are set to live on a tight budget

When abroad you will be subject to a foreign currency transaction fee of 2.99 per cent for every payment or cash withdrawal you make.

Can I apply?

You can apply if you're aged 17 or over, but to apply for an arranged overdraft you must be 18 or over.

You also need to have lived at a permanent UK address for the past three years, and be studying on a full-time course that lasts for at least two years, or on a one-year access course leading on to a full-time degree.

What are the perks?

Those who register for Everyday Offers can earn up to 15 per cent cashback at selected retailers, including the Co-op, Costa and Sky, but to benefit they will need to activate the offers they're interested in online.

For keen savers, the account enables students to round up card payments and put the spare change from each purchase into a Halifax savings account.

How big is the overdraft?

It allows for an interest-free arranged overdraft up to £1,500 for the length of the course, plus an extra year after graduation - up to a maximum of 6 years in total.

Unarranged overdraft requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and, where they are authorised, no charges are applied.

HSBC are offering students a £80 cash incentive and the choice of a £20 Uber Eats voucher or a year of unlimited next-day delivery with ASOS Premier

What to watch out for

When abroad you will be subject to a foreign currency transaction fee of 2.99 per cent for every payment or cash withdrawal you make.

Can I apply?

To apply for this account you'll need to be aged 18 or over and on a degree course or equivalent full-time education.

What are the perks?

This HSBC account comes with a tantalising £80 cash bribe, which itself could be enough to sway some students to join.

It also offers the choice of a £20 Uber Eats voucher or a year of unlimited next-day delivery with ASOS Premier, worth £9.95 a year.

To qualify, students need to make five debit card transactions within a month of opening the account.

How big is the overdraft?

Students get an interest-free limit of up to £1,000 in their first year, which could rise to £3,000 by their third year.

Both arranged and unarranged borrowing is charged at 0 per cent on student accounts.

However, if a student does go over their arranged overdraft limit HSBC will consider an unarranged request and will make the payment if it can, subject to status.

What to watch out for

If an account holder pays for something using their HSBC Visa debit card while outside the UK, they'll need to pay a non-sterling transaction fee of 2.75 per cent per transaction.

If they withdraw money from an ATM outside the UK, they'll also need to pay a 'non sterling cash fee' of 2 per cent. This is limited to a minimum and maximum charge of £1.75 and £5.00 respectively.

Can I apply?

To qualify you need to be 18 or over and to have lived in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man for at least three years.

You can't have another student account elsewhere, and you will need proof you've been accepted on to a qualifying course at a UK university or college.

TOTUM offers include 10 per cent off at The Co-op

25 per cent off Odeon student-priced tickets

Discounts from Apple, 16-25 Railcard, LOOKFANTASTIC, Superdrug, New Look, Jack Wills, Zavvi, PizzaExpress, ASOS, CrossCountry Trains, Missguided, Domino's, Thorpe Park and lots more

What are the perks?

Avid savers can round up their card payments to the nearest pound, with the difference being transferred to a Lloyds Bank savings account.

Students can also get up to 15 per cent cashback with Everyday Offers when using the card at selected retailers including the Co-op, Costa and Sky.

Those who open their account by 31 October can also enjoy a free TOTUM card for up to three years.

How big is the overdraft?

With a Lloyds Student Account, customers can apply for an interest-free tiered arranged overdraft of up to £1,500 in years one to three and up to £2,000 in years four to five.

The overdraft starts at £500 for the first six months, then they can apply to increase it to £1,000 in months seven to nine, and up to £1,500 from month ten.

Unarranged overdraft requests are reviewed on a case by case basis and, where they are authorised, no charges are applied.

What to watch out for

When abroad you will be subject to a foreign currency transaction fee of 2.99 per cent for every payment or cash withdrawal you make.

Can I apply?

You can apply for this account if you're 17 or over and have been a resident in the UK for at least three years.

You'll also need to show you'll be studying full-time on a course of at least two years' duration, or a one-year full-time access course leading to a degree.

What are the perks?

This could be a great card for those who expect to travel during their time at university, as Nationwide's card is free to use abroad.

Along with Barclays, it is also one of the best accounts on the market for overdrafts.

By the end of a three-year university course, customers of Nationwide can get up to £3,000 interest-free, provided they request an increase every year.

Watch out for the overdraft trap While many banks will simply block students from exceeding their interest-free buffer, some will charge student borrowers overdraft rates of close to 40 per cent if they borrow too much. For example, TSB - which offers a fee-free overdraft of up to £1,500 - will charge 39.9 per cent if students exceed that. Its account pays 5 per cent interest on balances of up to £500, so it may be better suited to those who plan to keep their account in credit. If it's a large overdraft they are after, students can find higher interest-free limits elsewhere. It is also worth noting banks will not necessarily give applicants the maximum fee-free overdraft they advertise on their websites. The limit can often be based on the student's credit score. Students should check their score before they apply (it is free to do so) and try and improve it if they can. If students don't have any other borrowing, they can try and give their score a boost in other ways, such as by registering to vote, or registering their mobile phone contract in their own name rather than a parent's.

The buffer is £1,000 in year one and £2,000 in year two, and unlike some other accounts, students will get the full amount if they are accepted for an overdraft, rather than a potentially lower limit.

How big is the overdraft?

Students can request up to £1,000 in each year of study, to a maximum of £3,000 in the third year.

FlexStudent is designed to prevent students from going over their arranged overdraft limit.

Can I apply?

Customers need to be 18 or over and not have a student account with another provider - although they can switch an existing student account over to Nationwide.

They must also have been accepted onto a full-time UCAS course of at least 2 years in the UK, and have an unconditional offer.

In addition they will also need to pay in at least £500 each term from the date they open their FlexStudent account.

What are the perks?

Similar to HSBC, both NatWest and RBS are whetting the appetite of students with a cash bribe - though they are only offering £50 rather than £80.

Also on offer is a four-year tastecard membership, giving students the chance to get two meals for the price of one, or 50 per cent off their food bill, at thousands of UK restaurants - as well as discounts at the cinema.

A tastecard membership usually costs £34.99 a year, so this could equate to a total £139.96 saving over four years for someone who is likely to take advantage of this perk.

How big is the overdraft?

Both NatWest and RBS allow for an interest free overdraft up to £2000, although during the first term this is limited to £500.

Both accounts will prevent students from being able to dip into their unarranged overdraft.

Natwest and RBS are offering both a £50 cash bribe and a four year tastecard membership to lure students in.

What to watch out for

The foreign currency conversion fee for payments and withdrawals outside the UK is 2.75 per cent of any transaction.

Can I apply?

Students must be 17 or over and a British Citizen who has been living in the UK for at least 3 years.

They need to be a full time undergraduate student on at least a two year course at a UK University or College, or completing a full-time postgraduate or nursing course lasting a year or more.

What are the perks?

The big money saver with this account is a free, four-year 16-25 Railcard, which will enable students to shave a third off their rail travel in the UK.

A 16-25 Railcard costs £30 each year to renew, so over a four year period it could save a total of £120.

Once they switch on Retailer Offers in online or mobile banking, customers will also be able to choose which offers to save to their card and benefit from up to 15 per cent cashback when they spend in those stores.

How big is the overdraft?

Santanders allow for an interest-free arranged overdraft of £1,500 in the first three years, £1,800 in year four and £2,000 if they stay on to year five.

Santander's 123 Student account has long been seen as one of the best offers around, with a free four-year 16-25 Railcard thrown in.

When a customer tries to make a payment that would take them into an unarranged overdraft, Santander makes the decision on whether to allow or reject the payment based on their individual circumstances.

If it allows a payment, it will take them into an unarranged overdraft, but it does not charge interest or fees for unarranged overdrafts on the account.

What to watch out for

The foreign currency conversion fee for payments and withdrawals outside the UK is 2.95 per cent of any transaction.

However, the bank does not charge a fee for withdrawals from Santander cash machines in Spain.

Can I apply?

Students must be 18 or over, live in the UK permanently, and be able to pay in at least £500 per academic term.

They need to be studying or about to begin an undergraduate course that is at least two years in length, or a level four to seven apprenticeship.

If they are about to begin a course, they must have an unconditional or 'confirmed conditional' offer before they apply.

Customers must not already have an existing Santander current account, and if they do, they will need to transfer it to a student one.

What are the perks?

TSB is one of the only interest-earning accounts, and will pay five per cent interest on balances up to £500.

How big is the overdraft?

Your overdraft starts at £500 for the first six months, then you can apply to increase it to £1,000 in months seven to nine, and up to £1,500 from month ten.

What to watch out for

Those who exceed their arranged overdraft limit, will incur interest rate charges at 39.99 per cent.

There is also a 2.99 per cent foreign transaction fee when using the card abroad.

However, if students have a 'spend and save plus' account there are no transaction fees.

Can I apply?

To have a student account you must be 17 or over (18 or over if it includes an overdraft); have been a resident in the UK for at least three years; and be studying for a full time course that lasts for a minimum of two years, or a one-year access course leading onto a full-time degree.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sneaker investing – those in the know don’t call them trainers, apparently – has become a big thing in recent years and as values have risen, so has the volume of fakes.

It’s not just knock-offs apeing standard sneakers anymore, some of the counterfeiters are dabbling in shoes that could go on to be worth thousands of pounds.

Can anything be done, does it matter and what’s the attraction if investing in sneakers anyway?

This is Money’s Grace Gausden went behind the curtain with eBay, which has its own crack team of fake sneaker spotters, to find out more and tells podcast listeners all about it here.

Alongside, Georgie Frost and Simon Lambert, Grace discusses the tests that can spot a fake and why eBay is cracking down.

Meanwhile, Simon looks at the comparisons between sneaker investing and other more established alternatives, such as art, wine and classic cars and, of course, the new kid on the block, crypto.

Also, on this week’s show the team discuss the courses for those who haven’t driven in years and the best cars to insure new drivers on.

Simon looks at why smart Chancellors can’t help inflating house prices and why the holiday part was the problem with the stamp duty cut.

And back on an investing tip, if sneakers are a bit too down to earth for you, how about backing a space investment trust?

Profit: Nike Yeezy 2 shoes originally retailed for £130 but are now selling for around £9,000
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The double dip recession is off... for now.

The GDP figures are in for the final three months of 2020 and the UK economy grew by 1 per cent, according to the ONS, despite widespread expectations that it would shrink again.

This means that even if the latest – and hopefully last – lockdown shrinks the economy in the first quarter of 2021 then we will avoid the dreaded double-dip – as you need two consecutive quarters of negative growth (forgive the economics speak) for a recession.

Of course, we don’t know when this lockdown will end or how heavy an impact it will have on the economy, so what happens in the first half of 2021 is up in the air.

But why didn’t GDP fall in the final stretch of last year, is there any way we could we claw our way to growth in the first chunk of this year, and how bad was the coronavirus year of 2020 for the UK?

The health sector was a a big contributor to growth in the last quarter of 2020 after being involved with running coronavirus testing and tracing schemes across the UK

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, George Nixon and Simon Lambert dive into the GDP numbers to take a look at what this all means.

Also on the show, are we finally going to see an end to the scam refund lottery from banks for those conned into sending money to fraudsters? George explains what people need to know about that and also the issue of disabled children child trust funds.

Plus, why has Tesla bought bitcoin, what does it mean and what on earth is Elon Musk playing at with his crypto tweets at the moment?

And finally, should you head for Oxbury Bank – the farmer-focussed lender with a new top savings rate?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lockdown Britain has produced a nation of savers, ONS figures showed this week, with people salting away almost 30 per cent of their disposable income on average.

But for those hoping that we might finally have got the savings habit, there’s a catch.

Those figures cover April to June, a three-month period when most shops were shut, along with pubs, restaurants, hotels and B&Bs, and going on holiday was a near-impossible task.

Deprived of the opportunity to spend, Britain put money aside instead – but is not spending the same as saving?

Code: Insert

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert, Lee Boyce and Georgie Frost dive into the lockdown saving phenomenon and look at what triggered it, whether there was anything other than an inability to spend that drove saving so much higher than in previous recessions and how the paradox of thrift plays out.

They also look at where people can put the money they have set aside – with interest on savings deals negligible – and whether the sudden imposition of a savings habit bodes well for people building up better nest eggs when life gets back to normal.

Some won’t have been so lucky in lockdown, however, with job losses mounting. The team look at how this affects those already committed to moving home.

And finally, are brand new mobile phones a waste of money? Chasing the latest handset is an expensive game, but a new breed of cheap but high quality phones are changing the minds of some of those committed to holding onto old ones.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@We are in the worst recession in living memory for the UK with GDP plummeting by 22.1 per cent in the first six months of 2020.

But strange as it may sound, does that matter?

We knew things would be terrible as the coronavirus lockdown pressed the pause button on the economy and people’s lives.

Shops were shut, businesses were shuttered, everyone who could worked from home, almost 10million people were furloughed, international travel was halted, property sales were frozen and children didn’t go to school for four months.

If you’d have predicted that was what 2020 would bring last New Year’s Eve, nobody would have believed you and they might even have called for help.

So, it should come as no surprise that the ONS released figures this week showing that this year’s astonishing actions crashed the economy – although the fact that the UK suffered more than any other major economy other than Spain is a cause for concern.

The question is, what next?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost dig into the GDP figures to find out why the UK was hit so hard, whether we can read anything into the ONS’s figures and what to watch out for to identify if the economy is recovering better or worse than expected.

The first six months of 2020 have wiped more than a fifth off the UK's GDP

Also on this week’s show, they discuss how amid all that carnage some households are getting their finances on track, how to buy a property in pandemic if you are an aspiring first-time buyer and how to keep your pension on track.

And finally, the Government in its wisdom has decided to push on with getting Brexit fully done - even if it means no trade deal by the end of the year – and that will mean imported cars get more expensive.

But fear not, new car buyers, because we’ve got the best British-built options instead – from a Nissan Juke shopping cart, to a gorgeous McLaren and the wonderfully bonkers Ariel Atom.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I'm 71 and drawing a company pension. I didn't realise that I may also be entitled to a state pension.

I 'contracted out' of SERPS in 1987 when I was offered a pension on a promotion which was free from contributions.

I started work and paying National Insurance continuously in 1966/7.

If I am entitled please 'guesstimate' how much, and also whether I can have it backdated to my pensionable date and whether I can ask for the backdated amount to be paid in one lump sum.

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Retirement finances: I didn't know I was entitled to a state pension - can I have it now? (Stock image)

Steve Webb replies: I hope to be the bearer of good news.

Many people assume that once they reach state pension age they will automatically be paid any state pension that they are entitled to. But this is not the case.

It is necessary to put in a claim to get your state pension started. The good news is that if you do not claim at first and then claim later you will usually be treated as having 'deferred' your pension and can make up for lost time.

In your case, you reached state pension age before 6 April 2016 so you come under the old state pension system.

I will deal first with the rules for those, such as yourself, who 'defer' under the old system before explaining how it works for those who come under the new system.

From what you have said it seems likely that if you had claimed on time you would have had a full basic state pension.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

In 2014/15 the standard rate was £113.10 per week.

You may also have built up a modest amount of earnings-related (SERPS) pension for the period from when it was introduced in 1978 to when you opted out in 1987.

I don't know all your circumstances, so please do not rely on the following 'guesstimate'.

But at a very rough calculation based on the information you have given, I would say you have probably missed out on around £40,000 in state pension to date, and possibly more depending on any SERPS entitlement.

If this is correct, you now have two options.

One is to take all of this as a lump sum. You also get a very small amount of interest on top. You should note that this lump sum is taxable at whatever income tax rate you currently pay.

For example, if you are a non-taxpayer you would pay no tax on the lump sum, if you pay tax at 20 per cent you would pay 20 per cent of the lump sum and so on.

The other option is to start drawing your pension now and simply receive a (much) higher rate from now on.

For each year of deferral you get an extra 10.4 per cent, so by deferring over six years, you would get more than 60 per cent on your pension rate.

With a current basic pension rate of £137.60 per week, I would expect you to be able to draw over £200 per week going forward.

It is obviously your choice as to whether you go for a lump sum or an enhanced pension.

The enhanced pension could turn out to be worth more if you have a long retirement (because you get the uplift for longer), but the older you are, the more attractive the lump sum is likely to be.

Turning to those who come under the new state pension (who reached pension age from 6 April 2016), the situation is much simpler.

The option of taking a lump sum has been abolished and the 'reward' for deferring has been reduced.

When you finally take your deferred state pension you simply get an increased rate, boosted by 5.8 per cent for each year of deferral.

Your experiences are a reminder of a wider point that anyone who is over pension age and has never claimed a state pension should consider doing so, even if they think they may not be entitled.

Following a recent report I wrote on 'missing pensioners' – people over pension age with zero pension – I have heard from people in diverse circumstances who all assumed they were not entitled but who have actually been missing out on pension, in some cases for years.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Last autumn, as the Government wrestled with surging coronavirus rates and the FTSE100 index fell to new lows for the year, something began to stir within the UK stock market – takeover action.

Starting back in October and picking up pace ever since, UK companies have been snapped up, largely by private equity firms and big corporations from the US. More than 30 stock market-listed businesses have been acquired over the past eight months, more are on the way and about a quarter of them, with a collective value of about £11billion, have been Midas recommendations.

The bids have varied in size from the £31million takeout of biotech firm LiDCO to the £3.8billion acquisition of security giant G4S and are spread across sectors – healthcare, financial services, property, manufacturing, even private jets and video games.

Rising returns: We tipped private jet specialist Signature Aviation when shares were £2.48 and the price soared to £4.11 on takeover

In every case however, bidders were prepared to be generous, on average paying 40 per cent above the stock market price to secure the deals they wanted.

To many investors, that might seem like good news. Their shares have come up trumps and they are now flush with cash from deep-pocketed Americans.

Midas recommended adhesives specialist Scapa in 2011 at 51p, for example. Ten years later, it was acquired for £2.15 so shareholders earned a fourfold return on their investment. In a far quicker turnaround, Codemasters, which makes Formula One video games, was recommended at £2.20 in January 2020. A year later, it was taken out by a US rival for an eye-catching £6.04.

TOO CHEAP: US FIRMS SNAP UP BARGAINS

And yet, the sheer volume of takeovers raises several worrying questions. Is the London stock market seriously undervalued? Are US firms seeing something in UK businesses that homegrown investors are missing? And are British savers in danger of losing out as a result?

The answer, in every case, is yes.

According to data from City broker Liberum, the UK market is almost 30 per cent cheaper than its US counterpart, and certain sectors fare even worse. Energy and property stocks are valued at a 45 per cent discount to their American peers, while travel and hospitality firms are some 40 per cent cheaper here than in the States.

The statistics are even more dire on a global basis, with the UK stock market a good 40 per cent cheaper than other world markets, a discount not seen since the 1970s.

Some of this valuation gap dates back to the Brexit referendum. When the UK voted to leave the European Union, investors were unnerved and share prices tumbled. They have recovered since but other markets have done better, even in recent months, as economic recovery has kicked in and the threat of the coronavirus pandemic has receded.

Brexit hit sterling too, which sank dramatically against the dollar back in 2016 and is still trading at less than $1.40, lower than historic rates.

That makes British companies look cheap to overseas bidders, especially American ones. Of the ten Midas recommendations that are set to leave the stock market, nine have been bought by US firms, while another Midas stock, Vectura, has just recommended a £1 billion bid from American tobacco giant Philip Morris.

These US bargain-seekers do not only benefit from the relative strength of the dollar, they are also weighed down with cash, having spent virtually nothing during the pandemic.

They are looking for juicy investments and Britain is a happy hunting ground. But there is more to it than Americans being 'overpaid, overdressed and over here' – as people used to say during the Second World War. The comments made by UK boards reveal that many have felt disappointed by the UK stock market.

Firms such as build-to-rent group Sigma Capital and asset manager AFH Financial wanted to expand at a pace and claimed it was hard to raise the money they needed on the UK market.

Healthcare groups Horizon Discovery and LiDCO have both been bought by US firms that seem to value developing businesses in this sector much more highly than UK investors.

And bidders for companies such as Scapa and financial group Equiniti highlighted these firms' innovation and their long-term growth prospects, indirectly suggesting they admired these businesses more than UK investors do.

The figures suggest that they are right. Individual UK shareholders are taking money out of the stock market and putting it into overseas markets instead.

MISSING OUT:CASH DRAINS FROM UK

Between January and May of this year, retail investors withdrew more than £2billion from the UK market, even as they poured hundreds of millions of pounds into global markets, including Japan, America and Europe.

As money comes out of the UK market, share prices fall, investors grow nervous, they continue to sell and a vicious circle can develop. British shares lose value and canny American buyers are able to pick them up at low-ball prices.

That means US savers reap the benefits when these businesses go on to flourish and grow, while UK investors lose out. For instance, four companies among our Midas recommendations – asset manager AFH Financial, pensions administrator Equiniti, Sigma Capital and airlines services group Signature Aviation – are being acquired by private equity firms, which are funded primarily by American investors.

With Brexit negotiated, with our vaccination programme among the best in the world, with our economy growing faster than anyone predicted, now is surely the time to keep UK shares at home, not just for patriotic reasons but because holding on to shares over the long term is the best way to generate value for your savings and for UK industry at large.

Encouragingly too, overseas institutions, which have steered clear of the London market for years, are creeping back, recognising that our shares are cheap and looking more closely at the UK than other parts of the world.

When investors find their bank balances bolstered by takeover cash therefore, they should follow suit and buy British. Assess companies in the way that American prospectors do, seeking out businesses with key characteristics, such as valuable assets, loyal customers and the ability to create high-quality goods and services.

So many of the recent takeovers have been for companies with better technology, better design or better ideas than others in the field. That is no accident. The UK has a talent for innovation and US firms have worked that out. UK investors will be rewarded by recognising it too.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nicky Foulston was just 18 when her father acquired racing circuit Brands Hatch. A multi-millionaire businessman, John Foulston had developed a love of motor sports and wanted to rescue the Kent-based venue from being turned into a housing estate by property developers.

Just one year later, in 1987, Foulston died in a high-speed crash at Silverstone and his daughter became her family's eyes and ears on the track, ensuring that managers pursued the strategy her father would have wanted.

A fall-out with management ensued within months and, at the age of 22, Nicky borrowed £6million and took control of Brands Hatch.

The year was 1990, Foulston made a phenomenal success of the business, and in 1999 it was sold for $195 million (£140million).

Well judged: RBG helped Simon Cowell, second from right, buy out the X Factor and Britain's Got Talent

Now, she is chief executive of an altogether different business, listed law group RBG Holdings. Foulston helped to bring RBG to the London Stock Exchange's junior AIM market in 2018 at a price of 90p. The shares are now £1.35 and should increase considerably in value over the next few years.

Foulston, a 12 per cent shareholder, is a great believer in dividends too, so payouts should become increasingly generous, even as the business grows.

RBG started out as Rosenblatt Ltd, a highly regarded law firm founded by Ian Rosenblatt, a solicitor who first met Foulston when her father died. Having become a client soon after, Foulston remained in contact with Rosenblatt. In 2016, he asked her to help him make his firm less like a legal partnership and more like a business.

Since then, RBG has become more efficient in the way it bills for work, and fees are collected more promptly from clients, sending profits substantially higher.

There have been some high-profile cases too. Only last year, it acted for Simon Cowell when he successfully bid for full ownership of Britain's Got Talent and the X Factor.

RBG has been on an expansion drive since listing, acquiring corporate finance boutique Convex Capital in 2019 and prestigious law firm Memery Crystal two months ago.

Foulston has also set up a litigation finance business, LionFish, run by former investment banker Tets Ishikawa, a specialist in the field.

Litigation finance centres on lending money to companies or individuals so they can fight litigation cases. Finance providers then receive a share of the proceeds if their customers win. It is a growing field but LionFish is designed to be different from its peers, offering nimbler pricing, more flexible funding structures and faster turnaround times.

Having started in May last year, the business has already received more than 250 requests for finance. Several cases have been accepted and success should result in some hefty returns, which may well translate into special dividends for shareholders.

Brokers are optimistic about RBG, even excluding potential returns from LionFish. The Memery Crystal transaction was well received by big investors and should drive growth this year and beyond, especially as Foulston and her team help the firm to become more profitable.

Convex Capital advises entrepreneurs when they are looking to sell their businesses and it was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic last year. However, the business has bounced back in recent months and dozens of deals are in the pipeline.

Analysts expect RBG to deliver a 78 per cent increase in turnover to £46million this year, with profits up 57 per cent to just over £9million.

A dividend of 4.75p has been pencilled in for 2021, rising to 6.6p next year, with further strong growth expected thereafter.

Midas verdict: Nicky Foulston is shrewd, ambitious and determined to repeat the success she had with Brands Hatch in her youth. Progress to date has been encouraging, however the best is almost certainly yet to come. At £1.35 the shares are a buy and rising dividends represent a further attraction.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Holidaymakers searching for a summer break have a tough challenge this year. Foreign travel restrictions due to Covid have thrown plans into disarray and UK accommodation is filling up quickly.

But for those looking for a cheap getaway as Covid restrictions are lifted from tomorrow, a house swap might be just the answer. Such an arrangement allows you to stay at someone else's home at no cost while over the same time period they stay at yours.

The concept is built on trust: you look after their home as if it were your own, knowing they are doing the same for yours.

Saving: Simon and Jane Perkin (pictured) – swapping their home in the Midlands for stays in Bath, Edinburgh and the Brecon Beacons

You do not need to live in a fancy mansion or penthouse to do a house swap. In fact, so many are looking for a change of scenery after months of restrictions, that we are simply happy to be somewhere – anywhere – different.

A key appeal of swapping homes is that it need not be like-for-like. A humble rural retreat might be just the ticket for someone living in a property close to lots of amenities – and vice versa.

To find a house swap, start by asking family and friends if they would consider a week or two in your home in exchange for the same length of time at theirs.

If nothing suits, you could consider using a specialist website such as HomeLink UK, Love Home Swap or HomeExchange.

These charge an annual subscription to share details among thousands of like-minded people looking for a swap.

No money changes hands. You both agree to use each other's household energy and internet, as well as a few extras, perhaps such as access to bikes and games.

It's more fun than a hotel Simon and Jane Perkin have planned four free holidays this year Simon and Jane Perkin have planned four free holidays this year – thanks to house swaps. They are swapping stays at their four-bedroom house in Warwickshire for holidays in the Brecon Beacons, Peak District, Bath and Edinburgh. Simon, Jane and their son Ed have enjoyed house swaps through HomeLink UK for more than a decade. Simon, a business and wellbeing consultant, says: 'It has opened up a wonderful world of luxury holidays and fabulous short city breaks – saving us thousands of pounds. We find it is often more relaxing and fun than staying in an impersonal hotel.' He adds that house swaps have a few hidden benefits. 'Having someone in your home can help deter burglars, and guests can sometimes help out with watering the garden and even feeding pets,' he says.

Household buildings and contents insurance should cover for any accidental breakages or damage.

However, to be extra safe it might be worth considering additional cover using a specialist insurer such as Guardhog, where you typically pay from £1.50 a day to protect against guest damage and public liability.

Caroline Connolly, a director at HomeLink UK, says house swaps are built on friendship and trust, and as such can be a much happier arrangement than paying for accommodation. 'There is no dreaded Tripadvisor critical customer mentality because both sides want nothing more than to be a good guest,' she says.

HomeLink UK has seen twice the number of homeowners signing up this year. The most sought-after destinations include Cornwall, and coastal areas around North Yorkshire, Norfolk and the South of England.

However, there is also strong demand for a modest change of scenery, which means you do not have to live in a palace to enjoy trading places with a likeminded family.

Subscription fees for an outfit such as HomeLink, with 8,000 properties on its books, are usually £115 a year.

This year, HomeLink UK has offered a special discount of a £50 subscription for new members who only want a break in Britain and are happy limiting themselves to a choice from 700 homes. HomeExchange charges $150 a year (£110) and Love Home Swap starts at £96 a year.

While you do not have to live in a show home to do a swap, it is important to keep it clean, comfortable and welcoming.

Because of the pandemic, it is essential to clean all work surfaces and make sanitisers available throughout.

It also helps to be flexible in these challenging times. 'It has been wonderful to see how understanding people have been over the past few months,' says Connolly. 'But because of the pandemic it might be necessary to cancel or rearrange at short notice.'

A few simple ground rules should also be set to avoid any confusion or problems occurring.

When agreeing a house swap, you should sign a contract laying out rules and a clear understanding of what to do in the event of a problem, such as a last-minute change of dates or if something valuable is accidentally broken. You might also like to exchange references through a house swap agency.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investors snapped up shares in British Airways-owner IAG yesterday as the City enthusiastically upgraded the airlines group.

Its stock is a steal after another washout summer hit travel firms hard, according to analyst Gerald Khoo at Liberum, who bumped IAG from ‘hold’ to ‘buy’.

He believes the current price is an ‘attractive entry point’ and urged investors get behind the FTSE 100 giant. Its shares rose 1.3 per cent, or 2.12p, to 168.98p.

Ready for take-off: Analysts at Liberium say they are confident air travel will make a convincing recovery and have tipped BA owner IAG is being tipped as a good long-term bet

IAG gains helped push the FTSE 100 to a fresh 18- month high, rising 0.8 per cent, up 59.1 points, to 7220.14.

British Airways is IAG’s major earner, but it has a stable of carriers including Aer Lingus and Iberia, which has helped it survive the slump in transatlantic flights since the pandemic broke out.

Liberum had been conservative about airlines this summer – but Khoo said it has been even more disappointing than feared.

However IAG could be a good long-term bet. Khoo said: ‘The path to recovery from the pandemic will be neither straight nor simple, but we are confident air travel will make a convincing recovery in the medium term, and IAG remains a structural winner.’

Stock Watch - Xeros Xeros Technology Group tumbled as the washing machine maker said the rampant spread of the Delta Covid variant in India would hold back product launches. Machines will not go on sale until next year, a delay of a few months from a previous schedule of late 2021. AIM-listed Xeros said it was ‘not expected to reduce the medium and long-term prospects for success’, but warned that licensing revenues would be hit this year. Shares in the group, which recently sold its first commercial washing machine in the country, fell 7.6 per cent, or 15.75p, to 191.75p.

In the short term it has lots of cash available and the strongest slot position at Heathrow, which is still one of the world’s major hubs and the ‘largest and most attractive origin and destination in Europe’.

Liberum’s deep-dive came as Heathrow said more people had travelled through the airport. Its terminals handled 1.5m people in July, though this is still far below the start of the pandemic.

Hostelworld also said it was seeing the green shoots of recovery.

Revenue was down a bruising 76 per cent in the six months to June 30, compared with the same period of last year. Bookings fell 73 per cent from 1.1m to around 300,000.

But boss Gary Morrison said customers were booking beds and rooms at places where travel restrictions had been lifted, such as southern Europe, and in the US, where people are opting for staycations.

Shares rose in early trading but closed flat at 95p. The Irish holiday group was one of a slew of firms to give financial updates.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@British police chiefs claim a recent crackdown on catalytic converter thefts in recent months has already seen cases in the crimewave fall by more than half.

Thefts of the emission-reducing devices - which in many cases are sawn off the underside of vehicles - peaked in March 2021, with 3,245 recorded instances in the UK that month.

However, thefts have steadily declined since, with 1,378 reported cases in July.

A calculated sting on gangs behind the the spate of thefts, as well as increased efforts to watermark the valuable parts, are said to have put a stranglehold on the crime epidemic.

Police crackdown on catalytic crimewave is having an impact: Cases of stolen devices from cars peaked at 3,245 in March but fell to just 1,378 instances in July following a sting on criminal gangs spearheading the thefts and the introduction of covert tracking of devices

A surge in the price of precious metals saw the theft of catalytic converters become a national issue earlier this year, and police across the UK joined forces to combat the growing trend.

The devices - which are fitted to all petrol cars manufactured from 1993 - are there to reduce the harmful pollutants emitted from vehicle exhaust pipes.

They do this by taking the gases produced and converting them into water vapour and less harmful emissions, via a series of chemical reactions triggered by metals, including palladium, rhodium and platinum.

These materials have shot up in value in recent years - and criminal gangs have become all too aware of this small fortune stored beneath your vehicle.

Not only have thefts caused significant headaches for motorists facing big repair bills, but they have also written off many older vehicles.

Prime targets have been older hybrid cars, like the Toyota Prius, Honda Jazz Hybrid and Lexus RX, which have catalytic converters with a higher concentration of these precious metals.

If significant damage is caused when criminals saw the emission devices from the exhaust system, insurer may deem the cost to fix the issue 'uneconomical' due to the value of the motor, thus writing it off entirely.

Catalytic converters have been marked with a uniquely formulated and heat-resistant solution created by SmartWater, which is linked on the database to a specific vehicle. SmartWater scientists can identify the vehicle it came from with just a fragment of the solution, increasing the chance of thieves being caught

A surge in the price of precious metals that can be extracted from catalytic converters has seen thefts become a national issue earlier this year, and police across the UK joined forces to combat the growing trend

In April, British Transport Police (BTP) coordinated a multi-agency operation to tackle to problem.

More than a thousand stolen catalytic converters were recovered and more than 50 people were arrested as part of increased efforts to accost the gangs behind the crimewave, which is most prominent in the capital.

During the week, over a thousand vehicles were also forensically marked by officers and partner agencies.

Toyota also announced in May it was to spend £1million water-marking the parts on 100,000 older vehicles serviced via its franchised garages this year.

Car makers generally have also reduced the amount of the premium materials in the devices in a bid to make them less attractive to thieves.

Toyota's bid to catch cat burglars red handed: The car maker's UK arm has been handed £1million to watermark catalytic converters on over 100,000 used models as part of increased efforts to help police catch criminal gangs behind the spike in robberies in recent years

Police set up a national asset database to register catalytic converters, allowing a specialist team to identify whether recovered devices are stolen.

The portal, operated by the Centre for Infrastructure and Asset Protection (CIAP), an intelligence unit made up of analysts who are accredited police contractors, has allowed for the tracking of organised crime groups around the UK by following the covertly-marked parts and where they are being sold to metal dealers.

Rachael Oakley, director of CIAP is spearheading a new a national scheme for MOT test centres to come onboard to help protect the remaining 26 million unprotected vehicles on the UK’s roads.

Number of catalytic converter thefts reported in 2021 January: 2,217 February: 3,200 March: 3,245 April: 2,083 May: 2,320 June: 1,940 July: 1,378 Source: Figures revealed by National Police Chiefs' Council

'We’re delighted but not surprised that this police initiative is deterring theft of catalytic converters, as criminals avoid traceable property, whether it’s vehicle parts, copper cable or jewellery,' she said.

'We are now calling on the UK’s aftermarket industry to join us, get involved and help roll this out nationwide.'

National Police Chiefs' Council lead for vehicle crime, Cheshire Police assistant chief constable Jenny Simms, said: 'It's pleasing to see that we are already seeing positive results from this multi-agency operation, however we know that there is still a long way to go.

'Policing and law enforcement agencies will continue to work with manufacturers and other partners to focus on catalytic converter theft and ensure that this crime, perceived as low risk/high-reward is relentlessly targeted, and offenders are brought to justice.'

National Police Chiefs' Council lead for metal crime, BTP assistant chief constable Charlie Doyle, added: 'We recognise the disruptive and costly impact catalytic converter theft has on victims, so we're very pleased that we are starting to see it decreasing.

'This positive reduction is testament to why it's vital we join forces to share information and specialist knowledge to disrupt those operating in this area of crime.'

Police officials says reports of catalytic converter theft should be made as soon as possible to increase the chances of detection.

People are encouraged to report any suspicious activity to the police by calling 101, or 999 if an offence is in progress. If you spot something at a railway station, contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40.

Alternatively, anonymous reports can be made to Crimestoppers online or by calling 0800 555111.

The Scrap Metal Dealers Act was introduced in 2013 to force scrap-metal businesses to better vet sellers and not accept cash sales. However, abuse of the system means thieves still have an easy means of benefiting from the sale of valuable catalytic converters

Edmund King, AA president, said catalytic converter theft is a major problem that has caused 'immense financial hardship and personal trauma' for vehicle owners.

He added: 'The AA has been working with the police and manufacturers such as Toyota to reduce the number of thefts by water-marking catalytic converters and providing intelligence on where offences have been occurring.

'Ten per cent of AA members know someone who has suffered from this crime and 35 per cent are worried but have not taken action to protect their vehicle, whereas 21 per cent have taken action.

'The drop in cases is a combination of police targeting of organised gangs and drivers, manufacturers and the AA taking preventative action. However, drivers need to be wary that some of these gangs may shift their tactics away from the larger urban conurbations to more remote areas.

'Drivers need to remain vigilant and consider remedial action such as fitting catalytic converter cages and being careful where they park.'

Organised criminals are scouring the streets for vehicles that are easy targets, carrying car jacks and tools to quickly remove the exhaust devices in another vehicle so they can make a quick getaway

Ham-fisted catalytic converter thieves are writing motors off

Organised gangs use jacks to lift vehicles off the ground to allow for easy access to the valuable devices.

While more skilled thieves are unscrewing them from the underside of cars, others are taking a more ham-fisted approach and sawing them off the exhaust system, causing irreversible damage and resulting in some owners having to replace entire exhaust systems.

Devices to secure your catalytic converter Concerned drivers can can purchase devices that lock in around the converter to make it more difficult to remove. Providers include Catloc and Catclamp, which can be installed on a number of different vehicles. However, they're not cheap, with prices as high as £250 for some models.

And because there is often no third party to claim against, drivers using their polices to cover repair costs are also losing their No Claims Discount, unless otherwise protected.

Some of those who have had the device stolen can face long waits to obtain a new one and get their car back on the road, thanks to the increase in thefts and fast-developing supply issues with parts.

This means they are unable to use their cars until a replacement part is fitted, else face fines.

Motoring association MotorEasy analysed 10,000 garage bills for This is Money in 2020 and found the average cost to replace a catalytic converter is up to £1,300, with over £900 of the cost being parts.

Zurich, based on claims by its customers, said the average payout for damages caused by catalytic converter thieves is over £1,200.

However, the AA says claims have amounted to anything between £2,000 and £3,000 when the devices have been sawed away from the exhaust.

Previous research by AA Insurance identified a marked increase in claims made by motorists who had catalytic converters pinched from their parked cars - some having had them stolen twice from the same motor.

The catalytic converter is part of a vehicle's exhaust system. Criminals in a hurry are sawing them off, causing irreversible damage that can result in repair bills of up to £3,000

Innocent drivers who fall victim to this crime also face punishment if they are caught driving their cars without a cat.

Motorists caught by police driving a vehicle knowing the catalytic converter has been removed can be fined up to £1,000, because the car will be producing higher levels of pollution than they are allowed to.

However, the additional sound the exhaust makes when a catalytic converter has been removed and not replaced will be so loud that motorists will be well aware there's something amiss.

While the vehicle will still be driveable, removal of the device will trigger a warning light on the dashboard, reduce fuel economy and cause plenty of headaches from extra exhaust roar.

Toyota cars in particular have been targeted, with the devices fitted to the exhaust systems of the Japanese brands' hybrid models containing a higher concentration of precious metals and being generally less corroded.

Hybrid cars are ripe for thieves as the catalytic converters contain a higher concentration of precious metals and are generally less corroded. It's no surprise then that the Toyota Prius - the most-bought hybrid in the UK - is among the list of cars criminals are preying on

The Toyota Auris hybrid (left) - the sister car to the Prius - has also been identified as a prime target. The Lexus RX hybrid SUV (right) is another model that's often preyed on by thieves of catalytic converters
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There could be a mobile price cap put into place in the future, a telecom expert believes, due to the rising cost of phone contracts.

Price is the most important factor for consumers when choosing a provider, according to research from Telness Technologies, a cloud technology company, which is why a cap could potentially be implemented.

Martina Klingvall Holmström, co-founder of Telness Technologies, believes a cap - similar to the energy price cap introduced by the Government - could be good for the industry.

She said: 'A cap is pretty likely to happen and I think it could be good for the market. We need differentiation in the industry and a cap will enhance the market meaning operators can offer customers different things and give consumers more choice.'

A telecoms expert believes that a smartphone price cap could be put in place in the future

What would a cap entail?

If a cap was introduced, it could be implemented in a number of ways, according to Martina.

One suggestion is to put an upper limit in place with consumers not able to pay more than a certain amount a month. The cap would likely affect the airtime and data element of a contract, rather than the cost of the phone itself.

This is due to mobile phone access now becoming a necessity, as opposed to a luxury, with people needing access to one to live and work.

As a result of rising handset prices, prices for mobile phone contracts can even be around £60 or £70 a month for newer models. But while the phones themselves drive prices up, so too does the usage in terms of airtime and data, in particular.

Alternatively, there could be a minimum price put in place in order to ensure vital infrastructure works can be afforded by operators.

Martina said: 'Another suggestion would be to put a cap in place for minimum pricing instead to help operators support an infrastructure for customers.

'At the moment, operators are so similar. There is a constant price wars with costs for consumers too low to support the building of new infrastructure.

'In this scenario, a cap could focus less on price and instead force operators to be more innovative and different to other providers.'

Maintaining and improving infrastructure is very important to the mobile industry but it can be costly.

For example, the 5G rollout that is ongoing in the UK is currently only available in certain towns and cities. But with more infrastructure in place, the more widely available it will become.

Whilst a minimum cap is likely to be shocking to consumers, it could help them in the long term as it would give them more advanced options in the future, according to Martina.

Why is a cap needed?

Ultimately, telecoms is a necessity, like energy, Martina says, as the user needs it in their daily lives and businesses.

Therefore, like energy, it could benefit from a cap, to stop rising prices getting out of hand.

One reason she believes a cap would be beneficial for the industry is because 'mobile services all selling the same sort of products', for example, similar contracts for similar phones.

This means differentiators are hard to come by and, as a result, price is the real battleground.

Martina said about the potential cap: 'Telephone firms are pretty much the same with similar offerings. Therefore, pricing becomes very important.'

As such, instead of rising prices to create competition, having a cap in place will create actual differentiation between providers.

Martina Klingvall Holmström, co-founder of Telness Technologies, believes a mobile cap could be good

Martina says as an example: 'Before the roaming cap, there was one network that said their customers didn't have to pay extra to use their plan abroad. But as a result, other providers started to do this.'

She said once the roaming cap was in place, providers could put other deals on to separate themselves from their rivals, creating more competition.

Another reason to impose a cap is due to the ever growing need for mobile phones and on-the-go internet access.

'Working from home is a major drive to have a cap. Ten years ago, you didn't have to have a phone but now we can't survive without one.

'Due to Covid and the lockdowns, consumers have to do much more online. You have to work from home and use more data. It is a completely different environment to a decade ago – instead of having a phone for fun, it is now a necessity.'

She believes another of the main problems in the industry is the lack of customer satisfaction.

'I would like to see the customer experience being appreciated in order to build up trust and satisfaction within the area.

'There is a customer service baseline with other industries but not in telecoms. It is so important to so many people. Networks need to gain trust and gain good customer experiences.'

Ofcom said as mobile usage has gone up over the years, prices have actually gone down

How realistic is the idea of a cap?

Whilst a cap might seem like a far fetched idea to some, Martina uses the example of data roaming again, to highlight the likelihood of it happening.

Previously, travellers from the UK were able to use their mobile data, minutes and texts within the EU without incurring extra charges, after firms were banned from charging customers extra fees.

After Brexit, this was scrapped and firms have started charging again.

However, Martina says this highlights that it is not a big leap to suggest that caps on your phone bill would be introduced.

'It wouldn't be something that would be very new.'

Despite this, industry regulator, Ofcom, said the price of mobiles has actually gone down as usage has increased.

This suggests the market has already become more competitive over the years - and potentially a cap would not be needed.

It added mobile customers typically pay a lower price if they take a Sim-only deal.

However, at the same time, its latest Pricing Trends report also found that some operators’ prices rose for new, and many existing, customers in 2021.

For example, BT/EE increased prices by 3.9 per cent from March 2021 across landline, broadband, TV, BT Sport and mobile, Three introduced price increases of 4.5 per cent, to be applied each April, and Vodafone has introduced price rises of 3.9 per cent, again to be applied each April.

As more people work from home, they will rely on their smartphones and internet access more

How would this affect the market?

Martina believes there would be more competition in the market if introduced.

She said: 'If caps were announced tomorrow say, you'd have big operators jumping in in an effort to try and attract customers away from rivals, creating an even bigger price war and potentially leading to smaller ones going out of business.'

However, there is a risk that a cap may backfire and 'kill off different segments of the industry', according to Martina.

She said: 'Whilst some firms are too big to fail, they would probably be happy about price caps as it might actually end up making it harder for smaller companies to compete.'

For example, if a cap is set too high, other, smaller firms may not be able to compete and will have to exit the market.

She said: 'However, some of the smaller, more agile networks might be able to respond faster as they're not weighed down by high IT costs.'

Meanwhile, caps often see pricing cluster near the or at the top of the permitted level.

She added that it will also depend on how fast different operators can adapt – if they can at all.

Many larger firms have infrastructure and high costs to keep up with but as they are giants in the industry and have huge existing customer bases, they will likely be able to adapt reasonably well.

Overall, Martina believes a cap would be good for the industry.

She said: 'I actually think a cap could be good. Whilst it depends on the type of cap, it could lead to a more competitive and innovative space.'

What is in place to help customers manage bills?

At present, if someone switches providers, renews their contract or enters into a new contract with their current provider, they can request a bill limit which will be included in their contract.

Those who are in contract can ask their supplier to apply one but they have no obligation to do so.

Most will send texts to customers who are nearing the end of their data, minutes or text usage.

If you feel like you need help with your bills, speak to your provider and see if they can help you set up a limit or a payment plan.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marks & Spencer is about to announce six guest brands in clothing and footwear as part of the drive by chief executive Steve Rowe to transform the business after the pandemic.

A selection of items from popular labels including Cornish-based Celtic & Co, sustainable fashion company Albaray and outdoor gear specialist Craghoppers will feature on M&S.com.

The other signings are Fat Face, Jones Bootmaker, and kidswear brand Frugi.

A sign of the times: The retailer is spicing up its fashion by curating a selection of brands it feels are relevant to its customers

The retailer is spicing up its fashion by curating a selection of brands it feels are relevant to its customers. These include Hobbs and Phase Eight, both popular for smart frocks and 'occasionwear'.

Dresses from Ghost, where M&S has a collaboration agreement, and Nobody's Child, have proved a hit with fashionistas.

Marks is also offering lingerie from Sloggi and Triumph alongside its own underwear.

The initiative to act as a platfom for other labels is known as 'Brands at M&S' and was launched in the spring.

As well as clothing, Marks is expanding its beauty offer to include brands such as Boucleme. It has also done deals with kids' stationery brand Smiggle and Clarks shoes.

'Brands at M&S' is mainly online with an in-store trial in Stratford in east London, but is being rolled out on an experimental basis in Argyle Street in Glasgow, Bluewater, Cheshire Oaks, Manchester and the Metro Centre in Gateshead.

Transformation: Boss Steve Rowe

M&S is also showcasing its own brands and in the autumn will be boosting its in-house labels Autograph, athletic wear Goodmove and Per Una, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary. It will later this year launch its first collection from Jaeger, after buying the renowned British fashion name in January for £6m.

The much-loved store chain has seen its market value tumble in the past five years as it has been hit by competition from high street rivals such as Zara, as well as from online operators.

Over the past three years, Rowe and chairman Archie Norman have been engaged in a plan to restore the business to sustainable growth by 'facing the facts' the company had previously failed to address.

Their strategy includes revitalising clothing and home, a £750million food delivery deal with Ocado and the reshaping of the store estate, shutting down shops that are in the wrong places and opening new ones.

M&S shares have risen by 12 per cent this year and the top team hope a recovery is now in their sights. The most recent annual results show that clothing and home was badly affected by lockdown, with net revenues down by 31.5 per cent and an operating loss of £129.4million.

However, online growth of 53.9 per cent was very strong and the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digital. Nearly 2million new customers last summer clicked on M&S. com, which has 13.5million visitors a week. There was a 200 per cent increase in the numbers downloading the M&S app last year.

Early evidence suggests the guest brands attract new customers and encourage people to shop more frequently. Rowe's aim is to deliver an 'omnichannel' clothing and home business, so that the stores and the website work together in tandem, bringing benefits to customers not available from online only retailers.

Another innovation is digital click-and-collect, so customers no longer have to wait at a desk but can instead use self-service digital screens. A trial in 22 shops is being rolled out to a total of 78 branches by Christmas.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tony Hetherington is Financial Mail on Sunday's ace investigator, fighting readers corners, revealing the truth that lies behind closed doors and winning victories for those who have been left out-of-pocket. Find out how to contact him below.

P.L. writes: I have reached an impasse with Nectar, Sainsbury's and Action Fraud over the loss of Nectar points worth more than £500.

I found that points worth £525 were missing from my account, having been spent at three Sainsbury's branches over three days while my wife and I were out of the country.

My local Sainsbury's tried to help, and said the purchases were not typical of our shopping.

But letters to Sainsbury's bosses go unanswered and Nectar has offered no explanation, apology or refund.

Shopping spree: Points were spent at a Sainsbury's store in Pimlico, London, when Nectar card owner was abroad

Tony Hetherington replies: Over the past several months, I have received dozens of complaints from Sainsbury's customers who say their Nectar points have been stolen.

After publishing some of these and warning that Sainsbury's – which owns the Nectar card scheme – was far from helpful, I had not intended to investigate any more.

However, if someone were mugged in the street and robbed of more than £500 I would expect the theft to be taken seriously, so I decided to look closely into what happened to you.

When you made a complaint about the theft, Sainsbury's rejected it, saying there were no suspicious circumstances.

So, since you say you were abroad when your Nectar points were spent, I asked the supermarket what it would take to make it regard the spending as suspicious.

You were also told that the goods bought with your £525 were not out of keeping with your normal shopping.

However, helpful staff at your local Sainsbury's at Balham, in South-West London, flatly contradicted this, so I asked Sainsbury's to say exactly what was bought.

I also asked where your Nectar points were spent. You were told that all the spending was at the Balham store, yet further enquiries show that this was not true and your points were also cashed at two Sainsbury's branches in central London, at Rochester Row and Pimlico.

On top of all this, the real shock came when I realised you had been robbed not once, but twice.

Since you were abroad when your £525 was stolen, and your Nectar cards were with you, this indicated there was a fake Nectar card in existence showing your account details.

You might have expected Sainsbury's to realise this, replace your cards, and flag up the fake card at its tills. Instead, someone clearly holding a party used your recently earned Nectar points to purchase 20 steaks and a large quantity of beer.

Again, I asked Sainsbury's whether this was your typical shopping.

Sainsbury's has now reconsidered and has told me the purchases made with your points do not match your usual shopping.

It admits your claim was turned down because nobody took into account that you were out of the country and not going from branch to branch using up your Nectar points.

However, it dug itself deeper into difficulty by telling me you had failed to report the second theft. In fact, you were able to produce email after email between you and Sainsbury's proving the exact opposite.

Sainsbury's has now cancelled your existing cards and opened a new account for you, with a complete refund of all your stolen points. Ungraciously though, it describes this as 'a gesture of goodwill', rather than treating a theft victim fairly.

I did ask Sainsbury's to say whether a fake card was used by the thief, and how long in-store CCTV recordings were kept.

Since the company claims to have its own Nectar fraud team, I also asked how many people it had prosecuted for stealing points, as the only such record I can find is of the prosecution of a Sainsbury's employee.

Sainsbury's told me it deletes recordings after 31 days, but it refused to say whether your thief used a fake Nectar card, or to reveal how many prosecutions it had brought, if any.

Lack of connection: Vodafone refused to talk to Mrs L.W. as the contract was with her late husband

Vodafone will only talk with my late husband

Mrs L.W. writes: My husband took out a 24-month contract with Vodafone for our grandson. This ended in November last year, but Vodafone collected two further payments of £46.

I complained and was first told it would continue collecting payments unless told to stop. Vodafone then refused to say more as the contract was with my husband. I explained that he had died in 2019, and that I would continue the payments.

But my grandson's phone suddenly stopped working and Vodafone told me his phone number does not exist.

Tony Hetherington replies: You have told me you kept being assured by Vodafone that someone would sort this out but no one did. At one point, Vodafone collected an unexpected £24 from your bank account, but told you that you owed £1.49, which you also paid.

I asked officials at Vodafone's head office to look into what had happened, and two days later you were offered a refund of charges plus a further £50 as a goodwill gesture. Vodafone told me it was normal to continue an expired contract unless the customer instructed otherwise.

It added: 'Unfortunately, we were not aware that the account holder, Mr W, had passed away.'

WE'RE WATCHING YOU The Financial Conduct Authority has warned customers of mini-bonds firm Northern Provident Investments that they may be contacted by fraudsters following the firm's decision ten days ago to put itself into liquidation. 'Rescue deals' that involve handing over more money may well be scams. The Belfast business was fully authorised by the watchdog and used its status to allow investors to put their savings into high-risk bonds. NPI also vetted and approved advertising issued by other companies that marketed these risky IOUs, including Blackmore Bond, which collapsed last year, owing £46million. I warned in April this year that the unlicensed investment firm Your Options Ltd was using NPI's authorised status to give false reassurance to customers tempted by the 7per cent yield on its Choices Bond. The Halifax company claimed NPI had 'all of the relevant protections and permissions', but failed to spell out that these did not include cover under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Almost all of Britain's bosses are grappling with the working from home dilemma: how often should staff come to the office?

Since the Government introduced lockdowns in March 2020, at least a quarter of the workforce – more than eight million people – have been working from home.

Many are strongly in favour of continuing this giant, national experiment because they avoid commuting.

Britons have saved at least £50billion in fares and other costs of getting to and from work.

Benefit?: Some research suggests that working from home has boosted productivity, thanks to less wasted time commuting

If workers once again have to travel to the office every weekday, then the commuting costs will feel like a pay cut.

But bosses know that an organisation's culture is essential to its success. Some research suggests that working from home has boosted productivity, thanks to less wasted time commuting.

But the long-term damage to staff motivation and morale in a Zoom universe is hard to gauge.

The risk is that we have reached a historic turning point and, in my view, we are sleepwalking into a decision made more for the sake of cost and convenience than the long-term health of business and the economy.

We are about to lose sight of all the benefits of having groups of people working in close proximity. If we continue, we may not find out the worst of the impact for years – by which time, this flirtation with home working might begin to look like a mis-step.

Most entrepreneurs I know desperately want most of their people in the office most of the time. They know that video conferencing is a poor substitute for face-toface meetings.

Nuance, humour, non-verbal communication and humanity are all lost on a digital screen. I try to do all meetings that matter in person – interviews, key pitches, important discussions.

Creativity and inspiration are hard to generate remotely. Mostly I feel drained after a video meeting, whereas often a positive real meeting raises my spirits and energy levels.

I realise that some people are still fearful of crowded public transport. Moreover, business leaders are worried about litigation from staff who feel they have been bullied into returning to workplaces where they feel unsafe because of Covid.

But I have a suspicion that many who indicate support for lockdowns in surveys do so because they are worried they will have to return to the office full-time when restrictions end for good.

Remember, ten million workers had no choice throughout the pandemic – they had to leave home to do their job.

Refuse collectors, postal staff, courier drivers, construction workers, hospital staff, supermarket staff, factory workers and many others were never offered the choice of sheltering at home. They kept the lights on and the country running.

My observation is that large corporations are the most hesitant about asking their workers to come back to the office, with those in professional service firms, such as lawyers, accountants and bankers, the categories most likely to work from home throughout.

Worse, I suspect bosses are just plain scared of asking their highly-paid and cosseted workers back from their cosy new existences – which smacks a little of cowardice.

For senior and middle management, living settled lives in spacious homes with gardens, working from home is doubtless a pleasant alternative to the office.

But for younger, newer staff without established work connections, who should be keen to learn, and who probably live in less salubrious surroundings, working from home is likely to be much less fun.

For anyone ambitious starting out in their career, I have a single piece of advice – go to the office every day and be in the room.

You will be noticed and you will get ahead.

Now is a great opportunity to take advantage of the fact that some bosses have been hopeless at getting people back to the office – and some workers are too scared or lazy to make the trip.

A reckoning is coming this September after the summer holidays end.

Assuming the pandemic continues to recede, most managers will insist that employees attend their usual place of work two or three days a week as a minimum.

If workers refuse, they may find their job is outsourced to India.

He's got his eye on some of the country's biggest empty shops with a plan to fill them with activities you'd normally expect to find miles from town centres and cities: climbing walls, trampolines, bowling alleys, 'street golf', fitness classes, e-sports and a growing menu of other activities.

The latest giant venue, which includes a go-kart track, opens this weekend in the old 85,000 square foot Debenhams in a shopping centre in Wandsworth, South-West London, taking the total number of Gravity Active centres around the country to 15.

Another 15 are in the pipeline, including more former Debenhams stores as well as clusters of vacant units left by the collapse of Topshop and others casualties.

'It had been a dream of ours to do a really prominent site,' Jenkinson, 39, says from his home in Pocklington, East Yorkshire. 'We'd been telling landlords for a while that's what we wanted, and it's taken the strain of the high street to give us the opportunity.'

What began with one trampoline centre back 2015 with his business partners Michael Harrison and Simon Whicker – a former senior partner at accountancy giant KPMG whom he met while sailing – has already grown significantly in scale and broadened in ambition.

Jenkinson says: 'The next three to five years is about families and having fun and enjoying the time they've got together. Our mindset has always been that we wanted to be a high street name.

'Other similar companies back then were one-site industrial estate businesses. But we set out from the beginning to look to the future. We knew we wanted five and then ten and kept asking 'what can we do that's different?'

Both he and Michael grew up in the seaside town of Bridlington, not far from where he now lives. His family ran fishing boats and excursions, and even a toy shop.

He says: 'I've known Michael since we were kids. We grew up together. He's from a travelling funfair originally and his family decided to settle in our little seaside town. He's been involved in leisure and hospitality his whole life.'

Jenkinson and his wife had just returned from more than a decade in the Caribbean and America working on private sailing yachts.

'One thing that industry does is create a good work ethic because you can never quite switch off – lots of really good skills that you can utilise in business,' he says. He recounts, on their return: 'Tracy saw an episode of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills – or something like that – and one of their husbands had opened a trampoline Skyzone trampoline franchise.

'She said it could be a fantastic venture, so we talked about it. We knew nothing about any of it but it seemed like quite a good idea.'

Harrison – the operations driver of the business to Jenkinson's legal and financial side – was determined to negotiate their way into top retail and leisure destinations rather than far cheaper alternatives.

'Looking back, that was definitely the right call,' he says, pointing out that has sharpened their competitive edge while also putting them in the right place at the right time as retail retreats.

'The plan was very different to what everyone else was doing. We wanted town centre locations and shopping malls and we questioned that strategy for a long time. Other trampoline parks were getting built out of town and they were paying very cheap rents. But we stuck to our guns, focused more on diversifying as we went and on being best in class – the best standards, cleanliness. We knew in the long term that would allow us to stay profitable when others fell away – which is what has happened.

'We were very fortunate to get a meeting with Land Securities. There was a unit at the back of the Xscape Yorkshire [ski slope] in Castleford they hadn't been able to get to work. A couple of businesses had tried and gone bust so they gave us a shot.'

That was 2014 and the beginnings of a 17,000 square foot trampoline centre. With imported kit – and some help from friends and family – they built it themselves.

'It was incredibly successful from the beginning. We increased footfall, helped support the other tenants – not just with the people we brought in, but the birthday party food delivered by Nando's and Pizza Express. It was good for everybody.'

Offers for more leases quickly followed – not just from Landsec but other major landlords too.

'We became the blue-eyed boys,' he says. As success mounted, so did their ambitions to grow and add new activities.

'We've been generating cash from day one and made nearly £1million [profit before tax and interest payments] in the first year. So we just pumped it all back in and carried on building.'

Now with franchise deals in Germany and Saudi Arabia, the international arm of the business is already up and running. They have just appointed a chairwoman – former YO! Sushi chief executive Vanessa Hall – and drafted in KPMG to help plan and raise strategic investment.

Jenkinson estimates the business will tap around £10million in funds by early next year from debt or investment on top of the cash generated in the business and hefty contributions from landlords – more readily available now than ever before.

The next 15 will include more giant centres like Wandsworth. Eight of those will be 60,000 to 100,000 square feet. Nearly all will be in former retail outlets.

Jenkinson says the new opportunities are not just retail closures, but a different generation with a new perspective on free time and how to spend it.

'It's hard for a pub just to be a pub any more. In Wandsworth, if you want to go and have a drink, we've got two bars, three restaurants and a whole host of other things you can do along the way rather than just stand in a pub. It has its place but business needs to adapt.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's most popular retail destinations are enjoying a stellar summer thanks to families who scrapped foreign holiday plans.

The trend for staycations has seen visitor numbers at some shopping centres nearing 2019 levels, bosses said.

Bruce Findlay, retail director at property giant and Bluewater owner Landsec, said the performance of stores within the centres has been further boosted by what he called 'committed shoppers' who have returned with a vengeance after a year and a half of interrupted openings.

Stellar sales: The trend for staycations has seen visitor numbers at some shopping centres nearing 2019 levels

He said the White Rose Centre in Leeds had seen visitor numbers rise to 'within 10 per cent' of 2019 levels, giving retailers renewed hope.

Shocking footfall figures for July, from analysts Springboard, had shown visitor numbers across the retail sector down 24 per cent compared with the same month in 2019.

But Findlay's best performing centres – including St David's in Cardiff, Gunwharf Quays in Portsmouth and Trinity in Leeds – have had a strong August.

He said: 'Now the holiday is on, families are coming for a day out again. We've started seeing dedicated shoppers arriving with a real purpose.'

And shoppers arriving to spend, not browse, means sales at some stores are outpacing footfall indicators.

Findlay said the return of university students next month to cities such as Leeds and Manchester would help. But he warned: 'The big unknown is the autumn and the lead-up to Christmas.

'A lot of brands have taken significant steps to prepare for September but others are waiting to see what'll happen. They are saying 'I can't guarantee we'll be open and trading.' It's obviously a very nervous situation for some retailers.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former Yo! Sushi chief executive Vanessa Hall has been drafted in as chairwoman at fast-growing leisure company Gravity Active.

Set up by two childhood friends, Gravity Active has drawn up plans to double in size to at least 30 locations.

This weekend, it opens its largest site in a former, giant Debenhams store inside a London shopping centre which includes bars, restaurants, a host of leisure pursuits and uses augmented reality to enhance traditional activities.

New start: Vanessa Hall is to chair fast-growing leisure firm Gravity Active

Hall has spent nearly 30 years working in leisure and hospitality including as a director at Bass, All Bar One and Mitchells & Butlers.

She said: 'We have an exciting expansion programme as people look for shared leisure experiences with friends and reconnections with colleagues.'

The arrival of the former restaurant boss comes as Gravity Active appoints KPMG to advise on fundraising for the company's next phase of growth.

Harvey Jenkinson, co-founder and chief executive at Gravity, said the company could raise around £10million by early next year, but plans are still to be finalised.

Gravity's centres first opened as trampoline parks but have grown rapidly to include climbing walls, indoor golf, go-karting, bowling alleys, e-sports and new interpretations of pub games such as digital darts and pool.

The company has its eye on ten sites in Saudi Arabia and in October opens its first mainland Europe site, in the German city of Leipzig.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This year marks a decade since the launch of the smart meter rollout - but just 43 per cent believe it has been worth it, new research has revealed.

Since being introduced, smart meters have been plagued by reports of malfunctions and delays.

This appears to have influenced thoughts on the devices with 78 per cent of those opposed to smart meters saying it is because they have been a waste of money, according to data from MoneySupermarket.

A further 21 per cent believe the in-home display given alongside meters is out of date and would have preferred an app.

It's been a decade since smart meters launched but many are not sure they're worth having

The comparison site spoke to 2,000 people to gather their opinions of the smart meter rollout on the tenth anniversary of its launch.

It found that, in response to the question 'has your smart meter changed the way you use energy?' 29 per cent of respondents said yes while 28 per cent said they had not.

However, of those in support of smart meters, 67 per cent say it is because they have helped them become more energy conscious whilst 54 per cent believe they have brought an end to estimated bills.

Another 52 per cent say they have encouraged a better understanding of how the energy market operates.

The survey paints a picture of customers conflicted about how worthwhile the meters are.

To find out how successful the rollout has been, This is Money takes a look at how how many people currently have smart meters, what the current government targets are for installation and the problems consumers have had along the way.

What are the smart meters?

Smart meters were introduced by the Government in 2011 as a way of helping households stay in control of their energy bills which in turn could help people keep costs down.

Now they are installed in homes across Britain, to replace the traditional meters including prepay key meters that most people have under the stairs or outside the home.

The devices measure how much gas and electricity you are using as well as what it's costing you and display this on an in-home display.

This means there does not need to be any estimated readings and consumers should only pay what they have used - something that could be more important as a large portion of the population continue to work from home.

Robert Cheesewright, Director at Smart Energy GB, said: 'Britain's smart meter rollout has evolved in the years since it began, with many millions of people choosing to update their meters with new technology.

'By getting smart meters we're taking a small but vital step to tackle the climate crisis, as well as feeling the benefits at home from greater control of our energy use.'

Some say their smart meter has helped them manage their energy bills but others aren't sure

How many have been installed?

Originally, there was a target to offer every house a smart meter by the end of 2020 but this proved unrealistic.

As such, in 2019, Government ministers said suppliers will instead have until 2024 to install the devices in at least 85 per cent of homes.

It introduced 'strict' new yearly installation requirements for suppliers and said they could still receive fines if targets are missed.

As of 31 March 2021, there were 24.2million smart meters installed in homes and small businesses in Britain, according to the latest figures from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

This represented just a five per cent increase compared to the same time the year before.

The rate of installations has slowed dramatically with 760,900 devices fitted in homes in the first three months of this year - 213,900 less than in the last three months of 2020 – a 22 per cent decrease.

However, it is unsurprising that installations were down, as the lockdown was still in place due to the pandemic.

This meant many engineers were not able to get into homes to fit devices.

Many energy experts say smart meters could help contribute to net zero by 2050 but, to do so, installations must pick up.

However, the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has recently admitted that smart meters will become redundant if Britain ditches gas boilers in an effort to go green.

He revealed new smart meters that work on hydrogen boilers - a possible future greener alternative to conventional gas boilers - would have to be installed.

In turn, this would make the multi-billion pound, much-delayed rollout of smart meters largely redundant because they cannot measure the flow of hydrogen.

There was a target to offer every home a meter by the end of 2020 but this proved unrealistic

What problems have there been?

There have been many concerns over the rollout since it launched with lots of households encountering challenges with their first generation devices (SMETS1).

Many were found to have a fault where they stopped working after customers switched suppliers.

Once they lost functionality, they became all but useless with customers having to ask for the existing meter to be removed and a new one to be installed by their new provider.

The second generation meters, SMETS2 devices, were meant to rectify this problem, however, many suppliers are still not installing these and continue to install the SMETS1 models.

Customers have complained that when they have specifically requested a second generation device, they are still receiving a first generation model instead.

This is likely due to an excess of products that suppliers are trying to get rid of.

Others have said suppliers have sent them continuous letters and emails asking them to have one installed - even if they have already stated they are not interested.

The take up, in general, has been considerably less than the Government anticipated meaning the initial target date of every home and small business being offered one has been pushed back multiple times.

Previous research from This is Money also found that, although smart meters are free, many customers could have seen their energy bills go up as a result of the rollout as providers have to pay rent for the devices - a cost which is likely passed on to consumers.

The take up of smart meters has been considerably less than the Government anticipated

What do consumers think?

MoneySupermarket's survey found that of those who said smart meters had not changed the way they used energy, 34 per cent say it is because they didn't see the point in them and 26 per cent said they weren't bothered about their energy use.

Another 19 per cent said they did not understand how to use their smart meter while 18 per cent cited not trusting their smart meter.

However, of those who said smart meters had changed the way they used energy, 73 per cent say it was because they had given them greater control over their energy use whilst 67 per cent said they cared more about reducing their energy use and trying to save money.

Cheesewright said: 'This latest research is clear. Britain backs the rollout, with almost double the amount of people saying that it's been worth the investment, than not.

'Research from Smart Energy GB has also found that over two thirds of those with a smart meter would recommend getting one.

'The rollout has had its challenges but with over 24million smart meters now installed, what has become overwhelmingly clear is how necessary smart meters are for a more affordable, cleaner energy system.'

Justina Miltienyte, energy policy expert at Uswitch, added: 'Smart meters prevent the need for meter readings and provide more accurate bills, opening up the potential for more innovative services for customers.

'The smart meter rollout programme has faced a lot of delays so far, and is taking longer than expected to complete. However, it's important to recognise that smart meters will be key for future innovation in the energy market.

'With the smart meter display, you can also see the direct impact your habits and lifestyle have on your bill.

'This is particularly useful if you have a prepayment meter, so you can better track how your usage impacts your available credit. By making your energy usage easier to understand, you can make smarter decisions to save energy and money, including feeling more confident switching energy supplier.

'The Government's new four-year framework on smart meter installations ends in 2024, so it's clear that this complicated rollout is not going to complete any time soon - and more work is needed to get smart meters in every home across the country.'

Ultimately, however, it seems that consumers may be undecided on the value of smart meters.

It is likely this debate will continue for years to come as the rollout continues with suppliers still pushing customers to have one installed in a bid to meet targets.

But for those who think they might be spending too much on their energy, they are encouraged to use price comparison services to see if they could save by switching provider or moving to a fixed tariff deal.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The vast majority of Britain's medium-sized businesses are in favour of shifting the end of the tax year to 31 December in line with its international peers, a new survey shows.

In most major countries, including the US, France and Germany, the end of the tax year coincides with the end of the calendar year. Ireland also moved its government accounting and tax year end from 5 April to 31 December in 2002.

Last month, the Office for Tax Simplification said it was considering moving the UK’s tax year, currently ending on 5 April, to either 31 March or 31 December.

Tax year end: Most UK firms would rather it coincided with the end of the calendar year

A move which would prove popular among British firms, since over 90 per cent said they would support it, according to a survey of 500 British medium-sized businesses by accounting firm BDO.

However, they said the change would need to be planned carefully with longer filing deadlines to help businesses make the transition.

'Businesses are hoping that a rethink of the tax system can help them flourish following the challenges of Brexit and Covid-19,' said Paul Falvey, tax partner at BDO.

'Changing the tax year to 31 December is supported by businesses of all sizes and will be particularly helpful for those with international connections.'

The UK’s tax year for individuals runs from 6 April to the following 5 April, and it has been like this for hundreds of years.

In contrast, accounting systems used by businesses have been developed around month and quarter ends.

The financial year for the UK government accounting and for companies runs from April 1 to March 31. That - and 31 December - are the two most popular dates for accounting for multinationals.

In June, the OTS said that if they were to make the end of the calendar year coincide with the end of the tax year, the transitional year would be shortened by three months and five days and run from 6 April to the following 31 December.

'Clearly there will be challenges associated with implementing this change, not least for the Government itself,' Falvey said.

'But in the long term, a 31 December year-end would also make life simpler for HMRC.

'Aligning the year-end with more of the international community will help taxpayers to calculate and HMRC to check that the correct amount of tax is paid by those doing business in more than one country.'

Medium sized firms would also like additional tax measures to encourage businesses to grow and scale-up in the UK, according to the survey.

More than half businesses said they would like the 'super deduction' policy introduced by the Chancellor at the Budget in March - which is set to end in March 2023 - to become permanent

Some 53 per cent said they would like the 'super deduction' policy introduced by the Chancellor at the Budget in March - which is set to end in March 2023 - to become permanent.

The super deduction allows companies to claim capital allowances at a 130 per cent rate for money spent on 'qualifying' machinery, meaning companies can cut their tax bill by up to 25p for every £1 they invest.

Businesses would also like further tax incentives introduced, with half saying that the government should introduce better research and development tax breaks for all sizes of business.

'The government has introduced a huge programme of Covid-19 support measures, but as we enjoy a summer with fewer restrictions, we should consider how tax incentives can be improved to inspire UK-based businesses to grow domestically,' Falvey added.

'Making the super deduction policy permanent as well as broadening R&D tax breaks would certainly be a good start to encourage further investment and innovation.'

Now Matthew McConaughey has been dragged into the debate after reports resurfaced of the actor, 51, announcing that hasn't used deodorant in three decades.

The Oscar-winning actor previously revealed that his aversion to body spray came up while he was filming Fool's Gold in 2008, with his co-star Kate Hudson requesting he give himself a spritz while they filmed together.

Matthew recalled in an interview with Playboy at the time: 'She always brings a salt rock, which is some natural deodorant, and says, "Would you please put this on?" I just never wore it. No cologne, no deodorant.

'The women in my life, including my mother, have all said, "Hey, your natural smell smells, one, like a man, and, two, smells like you."'

Despite being anti-deodorant, Matthew insisted he took his personal hygiene seriously, claiming to take multiple showers a day and brush his teeth up to five times a day.

He just 'doesn't like to smell like someone or something else.'

Speaking on SiriusXM last week, Matthew's hygiene habits came up again as his Tropic Thunder co-star Yvette Nicole Brown discussed the star's unique scent.

She recalled: 'I remember that Matthew McConaughey said that he did not use deodorant and that he didn't have an odor. So my first thought was, "I'm going to get as close as I can to him to see if he's right."

'He does not have an odour. He smells like granola and good living. He has a sweet, sweet scent. That is just him, and it's not musty or crazy.'

Matthew isn't alone in his decision to shun deodorant, Cameron Diaz and Bradley Cooper have also claimed never to spray their underarms.

Cameron, 48, previously told E! News: 'Anti-perspirant is really bad for you. Let it go and just trim your armpit hair so it doesn’t hold on to the scent.

'You’re stinky because you use anti-perspirant. It keeps all the stink in.'

Meanwhile, Bradley, 46, stated that the body 'self-cleans', telling Esquire: 'I don’t use deodorant really anymore. I do take a lot of showers, so maybe that helps.

'In the morning and then at night. And after I work out, I’ll take a shower. So maybe three a day.'

Not a fan: Cameron Diaz, 48, previously told E! News, 'Anti-perspirant is really bad for you. Let it go and just trim your armpit hair so it doesn’t hold on to the scent'

Julia Roberts, 53, credited the environment for her decision to shun the spray, telling Oprah Winfrey: 'I don't actually use deodorant. I don't like to share that with a lot of people, but it's just never been my thing.'

On an episode of Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, Kourtney Kardashian, 42, revealed she stopped wearing deodorant because she thinks it's bad for breastfeeding.

While he has not spoken about the reports himself, Brad Pitt's former bodyguard once revealed in a tell-all that the actor, 57, didn’t wear deodorant and 'shaves his armpits just as a girl would,' to minimize any smell.

The debate surrounding Hollywood star's bathing habits has been a hot topic of late after Ashton, 43, and Mila, 38, started a conversation surrounding their own family's hygiene.

During a podcast appearance last month, Ashton told Armchair Expert host Dax Shephard, 46: 'I wash my armpits and crotch daily and nothing else ever.'

Mila said she washes her 'slits and tits' and also revealed that she did not bathe her children Wyatt, six, and Dimitri, four, 'everyday' when they were infants.

Meanwhile Jake Gyllenhaal, 40, shocked fans last week when told Vanity Fair: 'More and more I find bathing to be less necessary.'

He noted: 'I do also think that there's a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and we naturally clean ourselves.'

Dax Shepard's wife Kristen Bell, 41, also said she doesn't shower often for environmental reasons, explaining: 'California has been in a drought forever. It's just like, responsibility for your environment.'

'We don't have a ton of water, so when I shower, I'll grab the girls and push them in there with me so we all use the same shower water.'

But not everyone is a fan of the hygiene trend, with Cardi B, 28, expressing her confusion over the movement of celebrities refusing to keep things clean.

The X-Rated rapper seemed as mystified as everyone on Tuesday, when she tweeted 'Wassup with people saying they don’t shower?' alongside a emoji with a raised eyebrow, adding: 'It's giving itchy.'

Joining Cardi in her thoughts about the situation was Game of Thrones star Jason Momoa, 42,.

The actor told Access Hollywood last week that he is not part of the club, saying: 'I'm not starting any trends. I shower, trust me,.'

He added: 'I'm Aquaman. I'm in the f***ing water. Don’t worry about it. I'm Hawaiian. We got saltwater on me. We good.'

Dwayne Johnson has also assured his fans he is not in the same category.

When a Twitter user brought up the subject this week, Dwayne, 49, wrote: 'Nope, I’m the opposite of a "not washing themselves" celeb.'

In fact the fighter turned movie star, who goes by the nickname The Rock, revealed that he showers three times a day.

'Shower (cold) when I roll outta bed to get my day rollin’. Shower (warm) after my workout before work. Shower (hot) after I get home from work. Face wash, body wash, exfoliate and I sing (off key) in the shower,' he shared.

Keeping clean: Dwayne Johnson also assured his fans he is not in the same category, penning 'Nope, I’m the opposite of a "not washing themselves" celeb'

Terry Crews, 53, then stood in solidarity with The Rock when he did an interview with Access Hollywood after his third shower of the day

'See, me and Dwayne are right,' he mused. 'I took one in the morning, after the workout, and then I took one before I got here. And then I took one in between acts.

'I love to shower. I love to, because I spend so much time sweating. First of all, if you ain't been sweating, you don't need to shower. But I spend all day sweating, all the time, running and working out, and it ain't nice.

'My wife is like, "Babe, babe, babe." I'm Mr. Old Spice, you know what I mean? So I've got to get clean.'

Chris Evans, 40, was quick to clear up some rumours about his bathing habits after an interview he gave last year about his life in quarantine went viral.

He joked last year: 'I just stay home and I never shower,' but was quick to clear up this month, 'I shower all the time!'

Jodie Turner-Smith, 34, didn't wait to be asked about her cleaning habits with Joshua Jackson, 43, taking to Twitter to pen: 'Before you lot even ask: in this house, we bathe.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anyone who has seen the film The Holiday will have been tempted by the idea of home swapping.

The Christmas romcom sees Iris, played by Kate Winslet, trade an idyllic cottage in Surrey for an LA mansion owned by Amanda (Cameron Diaz) for a two-week holiday of a lifetime.

Now, 15 years after the movie premiered, home swapping is more popular than ever.

City life: Joanna and Kris Fleming had a week-long break with children, Archie, 16, Amelia, 15, and Poppy, 12, staying in a luxury four-bedroom mews house in London’s Notting Hill

The concept is simple. You stay at someone else’s house while they stay at yours — and neither of you pay a penny in accommodation costs.

Ordinarily, British holidaymakers are looking to trade their homes for properties in sunnier destinations at this time of year. But this summer, soaring numbers are seeking exchanges closer to home.

Ever-changing travel advice, costly Covid tests and the risk of having to pay to quarantine in a hotel means many families have been forced to ditch their usual trips abroad.

But with more people opting for a staycation, the cost of holiday accommodation has rocketed.

And with one Suffolk rental costing an eye-watering £107,000 for a week, it’s no wonder families are feeling priced out.

So could house swapping save your summer holiday? Joanna and Kris Fleming certainly think so.

The couple have just returned from a week-long break with their children, Archie, 16, Amelia, 15, and Poppy, 12, where they stayed in a luxury four-bedroom mews house in London’s Notting Hill that would ordinarily cost around £1,000 a night to rent.

But by agreeing to swap their four-bedroom, three-storey house just 50 metres from the beach in St Austell, Cornwall, for the duration, they were able to stay for free.

Kris, 47, who runs a retail business, says: ‘House swapping is an absolute no-brainer when you are tied to taking holidays out of term time when prices rocket. This is particularly true this year with the demand for staycations so high. Swapping homes means we can travel in style.’

The Flemings enjoyed a fun-packed itinerary during their seven-night stay — lunch at Ronnie Scott’s Soho jazz club, a theatre trip to see The Lion King, a picnic in St James’s Park, shopping at Portobello Market and a day at the Natural History Museum.

Kris adds: ‘We don’t mind spending money on things like theatre tickets and some meals out in smart restaurants when we’re not having to fork out huge amounts for accommodation.’

Families like the Flemings use websites such as HomeLink, Love Home Swap or HomeExchange to arrange swaps.

You pay an annual subscription, typically around £100, for your home to be on the site.

Love Home Swap says it has seen a surge in new members every month this year, recording a 26 pc rise between February and March — around the time the Government announced its roadmap out of lockdown.

And Caroline Connolly at HomeLink adds that travel restrictions mean more people are swapping with other British families this year, rather than owners based abroad.

The key to boosting your chances of being noticed is to compile a clear, friendly description of your home with great photos.

If you find a swap you’re interested in, you just need to ensure your property is left squeaky-clean, clear some space in the wardrobes and lock away any valuables.

But because you are not renting the home, you don’t need to put away all your belongings.

In fact, home swapping is popular among families because it means they don’t need to pack their own toys, bikes and beach equipment.

Alison and Spencer Jago, from Plymouth, estimate they have saved around £2,000 on two holidays via HomeLink so far this year by not having to pay for accommodation.

Alison, 49, says: ‘Our friends often ask how we can afford to go away so often. House swapping means we can travel as much as we have time for without worrying about depleting savings.’

Alison and Spencer, 48, who both work as civil servants, enjoyed a week with their daughter Emily, 12, in a pretty house in a small village just outside Bath during the Easter holidays.

‘We had gorgeous walks on our doorstep and Bath nearby, where we did some shopping.’

During May half-term they stayed in a cottage in a village near Oxford where they could explore the Cotswolds and enjoy a day trip to Henley-on-Thames.

Over the past eight years the Jagos have swapped homes 22 times. Alison estimates they have saved £40,000 on accommodation costs.

‘In all that time there’s only been one occasion where we arrived at a house which wasn’t as clean as I would have liked.

There’s lots of trust involved but you meet some really nice people by swapping. There’s a lot of contact on email and phone with the other family, so you build up trust beforehand.’

The Jagos have previously house swapped with families in France, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Australia and Canada.

‘Going abroad is exciting but this year we’ve really enjoyed exploring parts of the UK that we’ve never visited. The beauty is that people contact you from places you might never have thought to visit. You never know where the next swap will take you.’

Jo and Davey Watkins, from Mumbles in Swansea, have been swapping their home for years. They recently had a family staying in their seaside home, where they live with their four children Polly, 14, Jinks, 12, Tom, eight and Meg, six. Instead of swapping, the Watkins family went to stay with friends in west Wales.

Their home is listed with Love Home Swap, which operates a reward system. You earn points by having people in your home that you can exchange for a swap another time. How many points you earn depends on your property and the length of stay.

Jo, 47, who co-founded website TheHowPeople.com and Davey, 50, an anaesthetist, are saving points for a holiday abroad next year. Jo says: ‘We have our hearts set on a big holiday to Italy with other family members.

'Since we are not sure we could tally up a straight swap, we are allowing lots of families to stay at our home this summer to build up points so we can stay for free.

‘We are lucky we have friends to stay with, as it means we can vacate our house and allow other families to have a well-earned break. And for us it means we’re another step closer to our own trip.

‘It’s been such a difficult time for everyone lately, and there’s a real feelgood factor to knowing another family are having a holiday which doesn’t mean raiding their savings.

'The family we have staying now are from a sleepy village in Hampshire and are so excited just to be somewhere where they can have a pizza delivered to their door.’

While there are enormous savings to be made, there are also some practicalities to consider. You must inform your home insurer and ensure your contents insurance covers accidental damage.

Insurer Direct Line says there may also be other exclusions, such as vandalism. If you do not have a family member or neighbour who can hand over the keys to your visitors, you may need an outdoor lock box where guests can access the keys using a code.

If you experience any problems, report the owners to the website you used — and be sure to check reviews before you book.

And, until you have agreed to a swap, stick to exchanging messages through the website rather than via email or phone.

Most sites will also offer an identity check service to ensure your guests are who they say they are.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The rise of DIY investing has delivered a revolution in buying shares, investment trusts and funds - offering investors huge savings through online brokers.

It's easy to invest in a stocks and shares Isa, self invested personal pension, or standard trading account online and start putting your money to work, without the need for a stockbroker or financial adviser.

That means you can invest around the world from the comfort of your computer or smartphone, but picking the right DIY platform or app is crucial and the array of different options has left many investors scratching their heads.

We explain how to decide on a DIY investment platform to invest in the full range of options: from shares, funds and investment trusts, to ETFs and direct retail corporate bonds.

Check the table for the brief details and read our full round-up of each platform's features and who they could be good for below.

Why does an Isa or investing platform matter?

Not so long ago, investing typically required a stockbroker or financial adviser and the willingness to hand over a big chunk of commission.

Now armed with a computer - or just a phone - investors can use a DIY investing platform or online broker and the wealth of research at their fingertips to hopefully build their fortune.

The right Isa wrapper or investing account has the power to boost your investments, helping you to build a portfolio and limiting how your hard-won returns are eaten into by fees.

DIY investing platforms act as a place to buy, sell and hold all your investments and a tax-efficient wrapper around them if you choose to invest in an Isa.

When weighing up the right one for you, it's important to to look at the service that it offers, along with administration charges and dealing fees, plus any other extra costs.

We highlight Isa and non-Isa charges, but don't forget that investing in an Isa makes sense, as it should protect your hopefully growing investments from as much tax as possible.

We've busted the charges of what we consider some of the best (and cheapest) DIY investing platforms, including different fees for buying shares, funds, investment trusts and ETFs. We would advise doing your own research and considering the points below before you choose.

Investing can be as easy as picking up your phone and using it to buy or sell funds or shares - and that's far cheaper than when it involved calling your stock broker

Flat fee vs percentage charge DIY investing platform prices can be chiefly be split into two camps. Some charge a flat administration charge, while others charge a percentage of investors' holdings. The former tend to always charge for buying and selling investment funds, while the latter may bundle this cost in and offer free fund dealing. All charge for buying and selling shares, investment trusts and other products that are not funds, but the dealing fees vary from as low as £5 to about £12. If you are a buy and hold investor putting away a large sum of money then you may benefit from a flat fee rather than percentage-based charging, which can mount up to a hefty amount. But if you plan on buying and selling regularly watch our for dealing charges, as these can also add up substantially and easily erode the gain from a flat fee. Lower charges for regular monthly investing can substantially cut costs.

How we choose the best DIY investing platforms

We have focused on two vital aspects, cost and quality. This is not a collection of all of the absolute cheapest platforms, these are some we think stand out and that also compete keenly on price.

All discount initial fund charges down to zero in most cases. Some funds can still carry an initial charge though - platforms should provide you with a list to check.



We have picked DIY Isa platforms to suit different investors and focus on those that offer a choice of investments - not just funds. Each one will be better for some investors than others and you should choose depending on your needs. Remember there are plenty of others available too.

This list is in no particular order.

Hargreaves Lansdown is the big gun of DIY investing. The website is packed with information from its advisers and analysts, the shares and fund data is comprehensive and there is a very handy app.

Investors pay a 0.45 per cent fee on their total fund investments up to £250,000; 0.25 per cent to £1m, 0.1 per cent to £2m and nothing above that. Shares and investment trusts also incur a 0.45 per cent charge on the entire holding, capped at £45.

Hargreaves has negotiated some reduced annual management charges from fund managers.

Fund dealing is free. Share, investment trust, corporate bond and ETF dealing costs £11.95 per trade. If you trade more than 10 times per month share-dealing costs step down. Regular monthly share and some investment trust investing is £1.50, dividend reinvesting is 1 per cent, with a £1 minimum charge and £10 maximum.

Hargreaves has its very influential Wealth 50, a range of Master Portfolios, and its Portfolio+ service to make investing progressively easier and more hands off

Hargreaves Lansdown recently announced it would remove exit fees and cut a number of its costs.

Standard non-Isa dealing: Hargreaves' non-Isa Vantage account carries the same charges except for removing the fee for holding shares and trusts.

Who is it good for? Those looking for an advice-rich service that is price-competitive but not the cheapest around. It does come with lots of bells and whistles, including a very good app and portfolios for easy investing .

Our tests found Hargreaves platform easy and intuitive to use and its newly revised app is good.

It offers a proven popular service weighted towards funds but with access to investment trusts, ETFs, shares and the corporate bond market under one roof. [ More details on Hargeaves Lansdown ]

Interactive Investor

Interactive Investor has monthly fee plans, ranging from £9.99 to £19.99 per month.

There are three plans that can be chosen according to your investment style: Investor, charging £9.99 a month, Funds Fan charging £13.99 a month, and Super Investor charging £19.99 a month.

With each plan you get £7.99 of trading credit per month, with different charges to buy or sell applying. The trading credit lasts for 90 days.

In the Investor plan, trades in UK shares, funds and investment trusts and US shares are charged at £7.99 each.

For funds fan investors, the same costs apply but trades in funds and investment trusts are charged at £3.99 each.

In the Super Investor plan, trades in UK shares and funds and investment trusts are £3.99 each and £4.99 for US shares.

Trading in other international shares is £19.99 for the Investor and Funds Fan plans and £9.99 for the Super Investor plan. Dividend reinvestment is just 99p for all plans and regular investment is now free.

Sipp investors pay an extra £10 per month on all plans.

Who is it good for? Choose the standard option under Interactive Investor's charging structure and you will pay £119.88 per year and get back £95.88 in trading credits – but you must spend them within 90 days.

The cost of buying and selling UK investments at £7.99 isn't bad, although fund investing costs more than some rivals. Free regular investing is a winner.

In This is Money’s view, Interactive Investor’s charging plan makes it a top contender among investing platforms. Service is good and the fees are keen.

Interactive Investor is a good option for those with larger portfolios who would find percentage-based charges elsewhere mounting up. Someone with £100,000 in funds at Interactive Investor would pay £119.88 per year, or just £24 if they used all their trading credit. At Hargreaves Lansdown, with a 0.45 per cent annual fee, they would pay £450.

Our tests show II to be easy to use, with useful functions such as excel portfolio downloads, and an app that has improved greatly in recent times.

Five things to consider when picking an investing platform 1. Cheapest is not always best: You need to think about a combination of price and service - it is worth paying for quality but make sure you are actually getting that. 2. What will you invest in: Different dealing fees for shares, investment trusts and funds mean you need to think about how you will invest and tailor your choice accordingly. 3. Tools and information: What level of useful portfolio building tools and information does a platform offer? 4. Overall charges: Don't just look at the admin fee or dealing charges. You need to combine both to get a true cost, along with costs such as dividend reinvestment and regular dealing charges. A low admin fee might look good but if you are an active investor who buys and sells a lot, then dealing charges will soon rack up and send costs soaring. 5. Extra fees: Check for regular monthly investing discounts, dividend reinvestment fees, transfer charges and other elements

Fidelity

Fidelity is one of the big investing names and has a platform packed with useful information, guides, market commentary and videos.

Share dealing has a flat £10 fee and this charge also applies to investment trusts and ETFs.

Holding investment funds carries a 0.35 per cent charge up to £250,000 and 0.20 per cent above that and 0 per cent above £1million.

However, if you are investing small amounts the charging structure is slightly different. Fidelity charges a flat £45 on amounts up to £7,500 before the 0.35 per cent rate kicks in.

There are no fund dealing charges for buying and selling.

Who is it good for? Fidelity offers very useful service. It is one of the big guns, has model portfolios, tools to help you decide how to invest and a wealth of information on offer.

Our tests found the main site easy to read and navigate, with lots of helpful information. [More details on Fidelity]

AJ Bell Youinvest has a 0.25 per cent annual administration charge.

Only one live Isa at a time Remember, you can only pay new money into one Isa wrapper each year, but you can keep an old tax year's Isa wrapper open (with no new payments into it) and open a new tax year one, or transfer all your holdings onto the same platform. Beware exit charges typically apply.

For non-fund holdings in Isas, such as investment trusts, shares and ETFs, this is capped at £3.50 per month. In a Sipp the cap is £10 per quarter.

For fund holdings it steps down to 0.1 per cent from £250,000 to £1million, 0.05 per cent to £2million and then nothing above that.

Fund dealing costs £1.50. Share, ETF and investment trust dealing is £9.95 - or £4.95 if you have traded ten times in the previous month.

Regular investing costs £1.50 into funds, FTSE 350 shares and a limited range of investment trusts.

Who is it good for? Youinvest scores with a low percentage admin charge that is also capped for shares, trusts and ETFs. It does have fund dealing charges, but at just £1.50 these are competitive.

There is cost effective regular monthly investing in funds, shares and selected investment trusts. There is no cheap dividend reinvestment.

Our tests show AJ Bell Youinvest to be simple to use and while it may not look as flashy as some rivals, it competes well on cost.

The Share Centre - Self-Select Isa

The Share Centre has been removed from this article after it was bought by Interactive Investor and no longer takes on new customers.

iWeb run by Halifax sharedealing offers a competitively priced service. Its stocks and shares Isa offers the chance to invest across shares, investment trusts, funds and ETFs, with a £100 one-off set-up charge but then no admin charge beyond that.

It costs just £5 to buy or sell funds, shares, investment trusts or ETFs. Dividend reinvestment is 2% with a £5 maximum charge.

Standard non-Isa dealing: Charges are the same

Who is it good for? iWeb is keenly priced for those looking to regularly buy investment trusts, shares or ETFs thanks to its low £5 dealing fee but the set-up fee of just £25 has now gone up to £100. Bear in mind that you do need to pay for fund-dealing here. [ More details on iWeb ]

Bestinvest Isa and standard investors pay annual charge of 0.40 per cent a year on their portfolios up to £250,000, and 0.2 per cent above that to £1million. No extra charges are added above £1m.

Bestinvest has no dealing charges for funds and standard share and investment trust dealing is decent value £7.50.

There are no reduced regular monthly investing charges for shares and trusts, nor is there cheap dividend reinvesting.

In an unusual step those who invest through a Sipp, as self invested personal pensions are known, see their charges cut to 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.

BestInvest offers a selection of model portfolio funds, rated in an investing risk-style.

Standard non-Isa dealing: Charges are the same.

Who is it good for? BestInvest is a good option for fund investors looking to take advantage of its research and lack of dealing charges.

Those buying shares, investment trusts and ETFs benefit from a £7.50 dealing fee, which is lower than most. The ready-made portfolios offer an easy hands-off route into investing at a reasonable cost.

It's also an interesting offer if you have a small Sipp and want to manage all your investments under one roof, as the Sipp charge is competitive. [More details on BestInvest].

The broker's online platform Charles Stanley Direct platform has a 0.35 per cent annual charge on fund holdings, above £250,000 of fund holdings charges begin to step down.

There is also a 0.25 per cent charge on investment trust or share holdings, with a minimum of £24 and maximum of £240 per year. This is removed monthly if you trade at least once in that month.

A Sipp costs £100 plus VAT per year but this fee is removed if you have more than £30,000 across all the broker's online platform services.

Fund dealing is free, but investment trust and share dealing will cost £11.50 and there is no regular investing option for this.

Investors holding individual bonds and overseas shares must pay £30 per year per holding.



Who is it good for? Active fund investors get a good deal at Charles Stanley with a low annual fee and no buying or selling charges. This is also a decent Sipp option for those with more than £30,000, who can then avoid the extra fee for pensions.

Those buying and holding investment trusts and shares can also do well if they trade each month and lose the platform fee, but that needs to be weighed up against £11.50 dealing charges adding up and the lack of a cut-price regular monthly investing option. [More details on Charles Stanley Direct]

US giant Vanguard has set up a UK investing platform but you can only buy its funds.

Who is it good for? If you are looking for a simple and low cost investment platform, Vanguard is a good choice. You only get its funds but the firm's trackers and ETFs are among the best in the business - this is a particularly good option for those looking to start out with LifeStrategy funds.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investors in their 20s have flocked to Hargreaves Lansdown following a surge of interest in the stock market during the pandemic.

Almost one quarter – 55,900 people – of clients added by the investment platform were younger than 30 during the year to the end of June.

Hargreaves added a record 233,000 customers overall, taking the total to 1.6m.

Lockdown surge: Almost one quarter of new clients added by investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown - or about 55,900 people - were younger than 30 during the year to the end of June

The number of young people making investments has soared during the coronavirus crisis, with many deciding to dabble in the stock market for the first time while spending more time at home under lockdown.

A surge in interest in crypto-currencies played a part in the trend, along with the rise of so-called meme stocks such as Gamestop and AMC, which young investors piled into.

Chris Hill, Hargreaves Lansdown chief executive, said the pandemic had triggered a ‘permanent shift in consumer behaviour’ and that ‘younger people now have a greater appetite for investment’.

It helped to grow the firm’s total assets under management from £104billion to £135.5billion.

Annual revenues grew from £550.9million to £631million, while profits dipped slightly from £378.3million to £366million.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investing for income is not just about picking the shares with the biggest yields.

A glance down the FTSE 100’s list of big payers is enough to reveal that there are some hefty payouts on offer from its corporate giants, but plenty of risks that may be lying in wait too.

So how can you combine investing for high income with dodging the dividend traps?

David Smith, of Henderson High Income, joins us on this episode of the Investing Show to explain how his investment trust aims to do that for investors.

It predominantly invests in shares, but the trust also has about a fifth in corporate bonds and currently yields 5.3 per cent.

Some of the Footsie’s big hitters are in Henderson High Income’s portfolio, but it also holds a number of FTSE 250 firms, including National Express and Britvic, which the manager says have solid single-figure growth that makes them an income prospect for years to come.

But why does it also hold bonds? Particularly at a time when there are concerns over low yields and high prices and regular forecasts of a bond market crash?

David says that the trust holds them to boost the income it can get, which means it doesn’t need to chase high yields on shares that risk a cut.

Potential investors in Henderson High Income should be aware that risk is raised its use of gearing – as investment trust borrowing is known – to buy bonds and boost their yield further, although the manager says it mitigates some of that by targeting non-cyclical big name companies, such as Amazon, Tesco and Virgin Media.

The trust is careful not to rely too heavily on the narrow list of companies that pay out a lot of the UK stock market’s dividends.

To highlight that David explains that the top 20 UK dividend payers contribute 74 per cent of the stock market’s income, whereas for the trust that top 20 – not all of which it holds – make up 37 per cent of its income.

‘The one thing about dividend yield,’ says David, ‘is that in isolation it can be a completely misleading guide to value and it could be illusionary’.

‘The reason why dividend yields are so high is probably the market’s telling you those dividends are unsustainable in the longer-term.’

When looking for dividend shares, he says it is important to look for three key measures of robustness: dividend cover, cash flow and balance street strength.

Henderson High Income has ongoing charges of 0.81 per cent and has a total return of 14.8 per cent, 17.9 per cent and 28.8 per cent over one, two and three years, respectively. By comparison, Vanguard’s FTSE UK All Share tracker fund, which does not invest in the same stocks or bonds, has returned, 9.4 per cent, 17.5 per cent and 34 per cent, over the same periods.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A storm has engulfed Neil Woodford after his mega fund was forced to close its doors and lock investors in.

The row has shifted from just the Woodford Equity Income fund that had the shutters pulled down, to the fund manager's Woodford Patient Capital trust, his investment firm itself and the companies it holds.

What can DIY investors learn from the affair in terms of how they manage their own money, keep an eye on what's going on in the funds they hold, and whether an investment trust would be a better option?

Furthermore, what will happen next for Britain's most famous fund manager, his business and his investors?

Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter discuss the Woodford blowout on the Investing Show.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@You will have heard the line about keeping your head when others are losing theirs, but do you know about the investment trust that made 23 per cent when shares crashed 30 per cent during the financial crisis?

Ruffer investment company is one of the funds that tries to emulate the famous opening line of Rudyard Kipling’s poem If.

It’s aim is ‘consistent positive returns, regardless of how the financial markets perform’, which in practical terms it says means, ‘we try not to lose money in any 12 month period, and to grow the value of our investors’ wealth over the long haul.’

So how does Ruffer do that? What were the investments that meant it outperformed the UK stock market by 50 per cent in 2008? And could it pull that trick off again?

Ruffer’s co-manager Duncan MacInnes joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter on the Investing Show to explain where the investment trust is invested now and how it positions itself to protect investors when a stock market storm becomes a hurricane.

This defensive position means that when markets are rising, Ruffer will tend to lag behind but when things turn bad it should be better placed to weather the storm.

Its aim is not to match stock market performance but to deliver long-term inflation-beating returns in a less volatile manner.

Over the past three years things have been tough, with just an average 3.4 per cent annual return, but taken over the longer-term it has delivered average annual gains of 7.2 per cent over ten years.

Duncan tells us why what is important is not which correction it is that eventually turns into a big drop, but knowing that one eventually will - and being prepared for that.

He also talks us through where Ruffer sees opportunities, and why these like Japan and gold miners usually lie in what people would term value investments.

However, one of the trust’s top holdings is also Ocado – and he explains why the Ruffer managers believe despite its relatively high price it could still be undervalued.

Weathering the storm in 2008 and profiting in 2009 set Ruffer up to outperform the FTSE All Share over the past 15 years, but could it pull that trick off again?

Was the stock market sell-off overdone?

Investors suffered in October with the FTSE All Share among the global markets driven down, but was the sell-off overdone and are people too pessimistic on the prospects for UK shares?

In this part of the Investing Show, Simon Lambert, of This is Money, Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, and Nick Batsford, of Core London, take a look.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Is the economy primed to bounce back?

That might sound like a strange question when you’ve just had the news that UK GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in one month, but January’s lockdown slump was nowhere near as deep as expected.

It seems that despite a tough lockdown being imposed, shops and big chunks of the economy being shut and schools being closed, the UK has adapted to restrictions better than thought when it comes to doing business.

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Jayna Rana and Simon Lambert discuss the prospects for recovery and also the businesses that have pivoted and started-up over the lockdown year.

While economies have suffered, stock markets have rebounded strongly – and in the case of the US and its growth star stocks, repeatedly surpassed previous record highs.

That’s been good news for UK investors backing the growth story, particularly the legions of savers with money in the giant Scottish Mortgage investment trust.

But a growth stock wobble in the US has sent Scottish Mortgage sliding – with the trust down 27 per cent at one point on its January peak – followed by a rapid bounce back to erase some of those losses.

Should investors be worried or is it a buying opportunity – and what is the one key investing lesson that Simon says this highlights?

Also on this week’s show, the mortgage that lets you fix for life – bringing potentially a 40-year fixed rate until 2061.

And finally, would you buy your local pub to rescue it from the threat of closure? If the answer’s ‘yes’ then there’s some good news: Rishi Sunak wants to help you.

UK GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in January as the latest lockdown hit the economy hard
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Rumours are swirling ahead of the Budget that Rishi Sunak will extend the stamp duty holiday by three months?

The idea is that this would help stop the collapse of chain after chain as buyers pull out, renegotiate or have to find more money if they miss the deadline.

The excuse being given is that conveyancing delays are holding up sales.

But wouldn't a three-month delay just kick the can down the road by another 12 weeks and lead to another cohort of buyers potentially affected?

Would it be better to just make the stamp duty holiday a permanent vacation from a bad tax?

Cut the tax properly, with no time limit, accepting that high stamp duty tax is a barrier to people moving?

On this week's podcast, Georgie Frost, Grace Gausden and Simon Lambert discuss the stamp duty break, whether it was a good idea and whether it should be extended or the tax cut altogether.

Also this week, Grace fills us in on the latest Grace on the Case and Simon puts forward his idea for improving Isas.

And finally, you might be bold enough to book an overseas holiday but would you be brave enough to start a travel company now?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The showstopper was a big stamp duty cut, the important element was about keeping jobs afloat, and the rabbit out of the hat was a great British meal deal.

But the question is, was Rishi Sunak splashing the cash in the summer statement enough to get the nation’s confidence back in the coronavirus crisis, or will real recovery require more down the line?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert, Lee Boyce, and Georgie Frost run the rule over the Chancellor’s performance (spoiler alert, he’s good) and the substance of his speech (you’ll have to listen to the show for the verdict on that).

They also ask the awkward question of how are we going to pay for all this – and does that even matter right now?

Plus, was that a killer blow for the ‘bad tax’ that is stamp duty; will a £1,000 bung be enough for a company to keep someone in work; how badly will the hospitality industry be hit; and just how crazy would you have called someone who forecast at the start of the year that by summer we’d have an official Eat Out to Help Out scheme?

On this podcast, the team dive into Rishi's rescue plan and look at what's working, what isn't and who the winners and losers are.

The stamp duty cut should keep more money in home buyers' pockets ready for them to spend and help the economy, but will they do that or save it - and does the suggestion that it will just push up house prices stack up in a tough buyer's market?

The furlough scheme will be wound down, but the mood music is now about getting people working rather than paying them not to - is the £1,000 bonus for that a genuine helping hand, or just money to firms who would have taken people back anyway?

And finally, the Chancellor declared he was going to do something Britain had never done before... and then delivered a Monday to Wednesday meal deal.

Is government subsidised dinners out a sign that the world has finally gone completely mad, smart little confidence booster?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tony Hetherington is Financial Mail on Sunday's ace investigator, fighting readers corners, revealing the truth that lies behind closed doors and winning victories for those who have been left out-of-pocket. Find out how to contact him below.

R.M. writes: I am a 73-year-old pensioner and purchased one-ounce gold coins from The Royal Mint for my grandchildren. The total cost was £11,000. The Royal Mint said the coins would be delivered by a specialist courier and had to be signed for.

When they did not arrive, I contacted The Royal Mint and some time later a courier came to my door and tried to get me to sign for the coins I never received. When I refused, the courier said he would go to the police, so I told him to do so.

The Royal Mint itself said it would not accept a claim from me unless I filed a crime report, but the police say they cannot accept a report from me without evidence a crime has been committed.

Gift: Coins, worth £11,000, were bought for grandchildren from The Royal Mint

Tony Hetherington replies: You were caught between The Royal Mint and a hard place. How can you prove a crime has been committed?

On the face of it, a failure to supply the gold coins you ordered is a breach of contract, not a crime. So with The Royal Mint insisting it did supply the coins, you have been left going round in circles.

According to The Royal Mint, the gold coins were sent in a package to be delivered by courier company UPS.

But because of Covid, UPS says it has stopped getting signatures when it makes deliveries. So does this mean the package containing £11,000 in gold might simply have been dumped on your doorstep?

UPS refused to say. Did someone from UPS demand that you sign for the delivery days later? Again, UPS refused to say. All it would tell me was this: 'We have contacted and are working with the police as they investigate this shipment.'

At least this does mean that although the police would not deal with you, it has accepted a report from UPS, presumably because UPS does not deny it did have the gold coins and was responsible for their safe delivery.

So where does this leave The Royal Mint? I asked staff there whether UPS was aware the package was very valuable. I asked whether UPS was instructed to get a delivery signature.

I enquired whether The Royal Mint staff were aware that UPS itself was unlikely to get a signature and might leave the package on your doorstep.

And I wondered whether gold coins despatched to customers were insured en route.

The Royal Mint told me the coins were in 'discreet packaging', which fails to say explicitly whether UPS knew the contents.

Was UPS told to get a signature? The Royal Mint simply pointed me towards UPS's own website, saying it had ceased demanding signatures.

Lost?: Due to Covid, UPS says it has stopped getting signatures when it makes deliveries

Could £11,000 in gold have been left on your doorstep? The Royal Mint refused to say, except to tell me: 'We have strict criteria in place for our delivery partners to ensure safe delivery of our products.'

And how about insurance? The Royal Mint said: 'We have all relevant protection in place to provide customers with peace of mind.' Well this was an epic failure, wasn't it!

I let The Royal Mint know that its answers were cop-outs and not answers at all.

Finally, last Thursday, I was told: 'Yes, we have all the relevant insurances for deliveries.' And best of all, after playing a dead bat for days and days, The Royal Mint told me it was contacting you to say it would replace all the missing coins.

I resisted the temptation to ask whether another £11,000 in gold would be sent via UPS, but please let me know when the coins arrive – and whether you are asked to sign for them this time.

Drip feed: Two pensioners have lost £510 due to the incompetence of Southern Water

Why should we pay £510 for Southern Water's mistake?

J.B. writes: We hope you can come to the rescue of two pensioners who have lost £510 due to the incompetence of Southern Water.

It told us excess water was passing through our meter, probably due to a leak – and listened along the route of the pipe and said the leak was probably under our house.

We then employed an outside company to pinpoint the leak and it found that it was not under our house, but outside our property line.

Later, Southern Water dug up the pavement to carry out repairs, but it has failed to respond to repeated requests to pay the £510 charged by the outside company that traced its leak.

Tony Hetherington replies: I asked Southern Water whether its own engineers had wrongly pinpointed the leak, and if so, why you should be expected to pay for its mistake. A few days later, the water company called you to say that payment of the full £510 was on its way.

Southern Water told me: 'We have apologised to Mr B. We wrongly identified this as a leak on his property.' Southern Water has also reduced your water bill to make up for any of the leakage charged to you.

Cruise refund is proving tricky

M.P. writes: We are having problems obtaining a refund of £4,300 that was paid for a holiday with Cruise & Maritime Voyages.

The trip was cancelled by the cruise company, which advised us to claim a refund, but the travel agent told us to claim directly from the company, which by then had folded.

We tried to claim through the bank cards used for booking, but this failed too, so we applied to ABTA, which is where things stand.

Tony Hetherington replies: Like lots of travel customers, you have been sent from pillar to post during lockdowns. You booked through travel agents Althams, which explained it was in pretty much the same position as you.

All the money had gone to Cruise & Maritime, which had collapsed, so Althams was limited to helping with a claim to ABTA.

Its staff, in turn, have been no more protected from Covid than anyone else, so lots have been working from home, which is less efficient.

I asked your bank to comment, but before they could do so, ABTA pulled out all the stops and sent a full refund to your bank account, so it is a happy ending.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investment fund managers are convinced that the UK stock market still provides opportunities for investors to make some serious long-term gains.

Although the market's bounce back over the past year from the shock of lockdown and economic disruption has been strong – the FTSE All-Share Index is up more than 24 per cent – investment experts believe there is more to come.

Among them is Richard Penny, manager of £110million fund Crux UK Special Situations.

He says that the UK stock market remains 'cheap' and could deliver annual double-digit returns over the next ten years.

'For a long time, the UK was on the naughty step,' he says, referring to Brexit. 'But the UK stock market is now a buyer's market.

'In valuation terms, the UK and European stock markets are cheap while US equities look expensive.'

It's a view shared by Dan Harlow, a fund manager at AXA Investment Managers.

He says the country's successful vaccination programme and lifting of most lockdown restrictions has created 'outstanding opportunities' in 'sold-off, domestic-facing sectors such as retailers and leisure companies'.

He adds: 'We are optimistic about the recovery for UK domestic names as the UK economy opens up.' Favourite holdings include Gym Group and Hollywood Bowl.

Penny's UK Special Situations fund is currently spread across 60 stocks, from all parts of the UK stock market – FTSE100 listed companies through to 'micro' stocks.

The result is an eclectic portfolio, but where the common theme is an opportunity that Penny sees to make money in the next two to five years, often stemming from management change.

At one end of the spectrum are stakes in household names such as insurer Aviva, mining giant Rio Tinto and hotel and restaurant giant Whitbread.

These are companies that Penny believes are mispriced in stock market terms and provide 'upside' over the coming months.

At the other end is a stake in a special-purpose acquisition company (spac) called Advanced ADVT, chaired by British businesswoman Vinodka Murria and set up to purchase private software companies.

Murria is best known for setting up software business Advanced Computer Software in 2008 and transforming it into a £750million company bought by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners in 2014.

Fund managers are convinced the UK stock market still provides opportunities for investors to make some serious long-term gains

'I've backed her business acumen before,' says Penny, 'and I like the fact that she has a personal financial interest in ensuring Advanced ADVT is a success.'

Penny is hoping shares in Advanced ADVT will increase in value once a suitable acquisition is made with the £130million of funds it has at its disposal.

Another key holding is infrastructure specialist Hill & Smith. Penny bought into the company six months ago at £14.50 a share and the shares are now trading at around £16.30.

'The company has benefited from new management brought in from manufacturing group Halma,' he says. 'It's become a core holding for us.'

Since launch in October 2018, the fund has generated profits for investors of 39 per cent.

Over the same period, the FTSE AllShare Index has increased in value by ten per cent.

Annual charges total 0.86 per cent and dividends are paid every six months, albeit on the low side at around one per cent a year. The stock market identification code is BG5Q5X2.

Crux Asset Management has £1.7billion of assets under management. Its flagship fund is the £850million Crux European Situations, managed by Richard Pease (ex Jupiter and New Star).
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Energy bills will rise for millions of households this autumn, with most seeing an increase of £139 a year at a time when many are still facing financial difficulties.

The energy price cap is increasing by £139 to £1,277 for the 11million customers on their suppliers' default tariff, Ofgem announced today.

Bills will also increase by £153 to £1,309 for 4million pre-payment meter customers.

The increased bills will start from 1 October, and last for the following six months until the cap is reviewed again.

Energy bills will rise for millions of households with most seeing an increase of £150 a year

The changes are being blamed on a rise in wholesale energy prices, and energy firms trying to recoup costs after customers missed payments during the pandemic.

Ofgem added surging global fossil fuel prices are already driving up inflation for consumers, making fixed rate energy tariffs not covered by the price cap, as well as petrol and diesel more expensive.

The price cap was already standing at £1,138, after rising by £96 a year in April.

This is Money previously reported that the price level was likely to soar by as much as £150 at the next review, according to energy experts at Energy Helpline, due to a rise in energy costs.

The cap was launched in 2019 to stop providers charging rip-off prices to households that do not switch every year.

It is reviewed twice a year to reflect the costs of supplying electricity and gas for suppliers.

However, many suppliers price their tariffs right up to the limit and have been accused of treating the cap as a target.

The hike will come as a significant blow to many, as energy prices reach their highest level in years.

In fact, suppliers have upped the cheapest energy deals by £180 in a year, research from Compare the Market found.

As a result, customers on pricey default tariffs and those who think they are paying too much are encouraged to use price comparison sites to see if they could save by switching or moving to a fixed deal.

The hike will come as a significant blow to many as energy prices reach highest level in years

These are typically much better value that the default options as the prices are frozen and cannot rise for the length of the contract.

Customers could pay nearly £250 less than the new £1,277 cap per year, if they switched to one of the top ten best-buy deals (see below).

Justina Miltienyte, energy policy expert at Uswitch, said: 'The price cap rise is the ultimate triple blow for homes across the country.

'Not only is it the first time Ofgem has raised the cap twice in a year, it's also the first time the cap has gone up before winter and the highest increase since the cap was first introduced back in 2019.

'This should be a real wake up call to consumers that the price cap will not protect them from skyrocketing bills.

'Unfortunately, the writing was on the wall for the cap to go up again, following the continued rise of wholesale prices this year. Prices collapsed in 2020 due to low demand during lockdown, but energy usage has dramatically bounced back.

'Households on standard variable tariffs have faced continued uncertainty over bills, with prices rising and falling as the price cap pendulum has swung to and fro every six months. But this time, it's less of a pendulum and more of a pummelling.'

Whilst many energy experts have criticised the price cap for hiking bills for millions, other firms have praised Ofgem for its introduction, saying that without it some customers would be paying bills hundreds of pounds higher.

Greg Jackson, CEO and founder of Octopus Energy, said: 'The price cap is the single most effective intervention for energy customers.

'It's like the minimum wage - it guarantees a level of decency for everyone, but of course they can still do better if they shop around.

'Global gas prices have tripled in the last year, so without the price cap, energy prices would be hundreds of pounds higher than they are now. Never has the cap been more vital and it should be made permanent.'

Best energy deals on the market

This is Money, with help from Compare the Market, has compiled the best energy deals currently on the market.

All but two are fixed deals, as these are usually better value compared to standard default tariffs.

New supplier, Eon Next, offers the cheapest deal on its Next Exclusive v2 contract.

Customers will be signed up for a year for an average of £942.10, with no exit fee.

The second best deal is with Ebico Living on its Ebico Standard April 2021 v1 variable deal costing £1,032.21 a year.

Meanwhile, challenger supplier, Avro Energy, offers the cheapest deal on its Simple and Flow12M contract.

Customers will be signed up for a year for an average of £1,035.53, with no exit fee.

However, it is not a green tariff - which may be a deal-breaker for homes looking to be more environmentally friendly.

Eon is the only Big Six provider to make the list with its Fix Again 15 months v10 deal costing £1,049.76.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@For those put off by the cost of a holiday this summer, there are plenty of options closer to home to keep the children busy - without breaking the bank.

Here, Holly Thomas shares top tips for bagging bargain family fun.

Adventure: Alffi and Lili Jones at the Llanelli Wetland Centre

DISCOUNT DAY TRIPS

Buying tickets for local attractions in advance almost always works out cheaper. For example, an online ticket for Legoland Windsor costs £29 compared with £53 on arrival.

Using a Tesco Clubcard or Nectar points to buy tickets can bring down the price further. When spent on a day out at one of 150 attractions, every 50p in Clubcard vouchers is worth £1.50.

For Legoland Windsor, that means a one-day entry pass could cost just £11.50 in vouchers - less than half the online price.

Websites such as vouchercodes.co.uk, and hotukdeals.com also list discount codes for big attractions.

Try discount website picniq.com for offers such as up to 23pc off tickets to Chessington World of Adventures.

EAT OUT FOR LESS

A host of pubs and restaurants are offering cheap or even free meals for children this summer. At Hungry Horse pubs, children can eat for free between 8am and 12pm, as long as an adult breakfast is also ordered.

While at Sizzling Pubs & Grill youngsters eat for just £1 from Monday to Friday, between 3pm and 7pm, with the purchase of every adult main meal.

Farmhouse Inns is offering a similar deal, though you can eat at any time of day, Monday to Friday. And restaurants without promotions can still be affordable; at Bella Italia the children’s menu starts at £5.99.

FUN ON THE FARM

Pick-your-own-fruit farms make for a wholesome day out. Strawberries are the most common fruit to pick, but apples, gooseberries, rhubarb and blueberries, as well as vegetables such as sweetcorn and courgettes, are also up for grabs. Anything you want to take home is charged by weight.

Entry is usually free or just a few pounds, but there is typically a minimum spend of around £4. Farms often provide containers, but to save on plastic, you could bring your own.

Many places also put on extra activities for children, such as adventure playgrounds and nature trails. Visit pickyourownfarms.org.uk and pyo.co.uk to take a look at the different options.

MOVIE NIGHTS

Odeon Cinema is running Odeon Kids screenings all summer, with tickets priced from £2.50. Check online (odeon.co.uk) for showings at your local cinema. There are also Mini Mornings from £2.49 per ticket at your local Vue cinema (myvue.com).

At Vue cinemas there are Mini Mornings that start from £2.49 per ticket

HALF-PRICE SHOWS

Theatre lovers should make sure they are signed up to receive updates and offers during Kids Week, an annual promotion throughout August where an adult and child (aged 17 or under) can get half-price tickets to shows.

You can book up to eight tickets, with no more than four adults. Four or more children must be accompanied by at least two adults. Visit officiallondontheatre.com/kids-week and choose from a wide variety of London musicals, plays, comedies and children’s shows.

An annual pass is just the ticket NHS workers Catrin and Neil Jones, of Carmarthenshire, Wales, have bought several year-long memberships so they can fill the summer with fun days out with their children, Lili, seven, and Alffi, four. Catrin says: ‘We have no plans to go abroad any time soon, so we decided to make sure we explore as much of the UK as we can, starting on our own doorstep.’ Their most recent purchase was a family pass to the Llanelli Wetland Centre, just 30 minutes from their home. Family membership starts at £72. ‘We only have to go four times to make the pass worth it — we’ve already been three times,’ Catrin says. The pair, both 39, also have annual passes for the The National Botanic Garden of Wales, the National Trust and Cadw, which manages 130 historic properties. They have been documenting their trips on YouTube and social media under the name Silver Nugget Adventure.

SIGN UP TO SAVE

If you live near to National Trust properties or a local zoo and can visit regularly, then an annual membership can work out much cheaper than daily tickets. An annual pass to Longleat Safari Park costs £100 for customers aged 16 to 59, and £75 for children aged between three and 15. If you’re over 60 it’s £90.

With a one-day ticket costing £34.95 for adults and £26.20 for kids, you need to visit only three times a year to benefit. A National Art Pass gives you free entry to hundreds of museums and galleries, plus 50 pc off major exhibitions. Passes cost £73, or £45 if you’re under 30, and £10 for under-16s (artfund.org).

FAB FREEBIES

The Canal & River Trust (canalrivertrust.org.uk) is offering free fishing taster sessions for those who want to learn. If you own bikes, the National Trust lists a selection of child-friendly cycle routes (nationaltrust.org.uk), while some local councils offer residents free swimming at their nearest pool. You could also pack up a picnic and head for one of the UK’s Woodland Trust forests (woodlandtrust.org.uk).
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Growing numbers of UK households are already using satellite broadband, most of them in rural areas, new research has revealed.

Satellite broadband can offer a more reliable service for people in locations that are poorly served by traditional connections and are unlikely to have access to full fibre internet.

However, despite its appeal, set-up costs of about £500 deter two thirds of potential consumers from trying this form of broadband connection, according to data from Uswitch.

This is Money takes a look at exactly what satellite broadband is, if it could be beneficial for you and how expensive it really is.

Some customers are said to be put off having satellite broadband due to the cost of installation

How does satellite broadband work?

Much like satellite TV, satellite broadband is beamed from space to a satellite dish that's installed on the property. It then gets hooked up to a Wi-Fi router like normal broadband.

As it doesn't rely on a network of cables going into every home, it's expected to become a favourable option for people living in rural areas in the years to come.

The new satellite internet technology that's currently being introduced is expected to completely replace the older, slower system that currently exists.

Firms like Tesla billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX and OneWeb are revolutionising the technology with satellites now able to provide internet speeds of up to 300Mbps.

This is much faster than the UK's average speed which currently stands at 64Mbps.

To put this into perspective, you could use satellite broadband to download a two-hour HD film in around four and a half minutes but it would take roughly 18 minutes with a speed of 64Mbps.

Is it expensive?

Customers looking to benefit from satellite broadband will have to pay to have a satellite installed at the side of their home, along with a transmitter.

This costs around £500 but could be even more expensive which might put many off.

However, users of the technology say they pay £29.70 a month on average for the service, compared to an average £33.60 for all broadband customers.

If sticking with satellite broadband, whilst the upfront cost is high, it could mean you make savings over the long term.

Elon Musk's Starlink is one of the two firms in the UK offering consumers satellite broadband

Who would benefit from satellite broadband?

Almost 200,000 UK homes are currently struggling with speeds lower than 10Mbps — the level that Ofcom considers a decent service.

This means for rural households, satellite broadband could be a lifeline due to their unreliable or slow existing connections.

Coverage from satellite broadband is set to become universal with Elon Musk beginning a UK trial of his Starlink satellite broadband system in January.

It is hoped this will have 500,000 users worldwide within a year while BT has joined forces with operator OneWeb to provide connections to people in remote areas.

Other existing UK satellite broadband providers include Broadband Everywhere, Freedomsat, KONNECT and Satellite Internet.

Whilst there is the option of full fibre broadband, which can in some cases provide similar speeds to satellite internet, those in rural areas are unlikely to see any infrastructure built in their area for some years due to the difficulty and expense of the operation.

Holly Cox, head of digital at Compare the Market, said: 'If you live in a remote rural area then satellite broadband could be a good option to get online.

'The main advantage of satellite broadband is that is available wherever you are in the UK, reaching places that cables can't. All you need is an outside wall to install a satellite dish that has a clear view of the sky to the south.

'That makes it ideal for areas where fixed-line broadband is painfully slow or even non-existent.'

According to Ofcom, which received data from providers and estimates for providers who haven’t submitted data to the watchdog, there were around 27,000 fixed satellite broadband connections at the end of 2020.

Satellite broadband could be a 'lifeline' for rural customers struggling to get decent internet

What are the downsides?

Aside from the high set up cost of around £500, extreme weather can also affect a satellite broadband connection with heavy rain and wind potentially reducing speeds or even causing an outage.

Another issue is the latency which is the delay, or lag, between requesting online information and receiving it, according to Compare the Market.

Satellite broadband suffers from high latency because of the time it takes for a broadband signal to travel to Earth from the geostationary orbit, 22,200 miles up in space.

This means it could prove problematic if you're live streaming, gaming or video calling on VoIP services such as Skype.

However, there are plans to launch Low Earth Orbit satellites in the next few years which will orbit closer to Earth and could help resolve the latency issue for satellite broadband users.

Cox added: 'There are some significant drawbacks to using satellite broadband. The biggest issue for most households will be the set-up cost which can be around £600.

'Also, unlike the range of fibre optic packages that offer unlimited data, most satellite broadband packages have a monthly data usage cap or might only give you a certain amount of data at top speed.

'This means you'll need to work out how much you're likely to download each month before taking out a contract. For context, it takes about 1GB of data to stream Netflix at standard definition for an hour.

'Some satellite broadband providers do offer contracts with an unlimited off-peak period, which can be used for larger downloads.

'Prices range from around £20 per month up to around £87, the cost can be higher depending on how much data is needed.'

Satellites now able to provide internet speeds of up to 300Mbps - similar to full fibre options

Are there many good deals?

Whilst there are several firms offering the older, slower version of satellite broadband, there are only two companies giving customers the new, speedier alternative.

Starlink and OneWeb are the two firms offering the service in the UK, however, not everyone will be able to join.

Only customers in select rural locations can access Starlink services with OneWeb still not available to households just yet.

However, consumers will not have long to wait as the expansion is happening rapidly with hopes for OneWeb to launch in October 2021, with a global operation available by June 2022.

Similarly, Starlink is expanding its offerings to more customers as time goes on.

Ernest Doku, broadband expert at Uswitch, said: 'Satellite broadband is improving all the time, and with big players like Starlink entering the UK market, connections are only going to get faster and more reliable.

'Satellite broadband offers hope to residents in rural areas who have struggled to get a decent connection from traditional providers, and we'll be watching to see how BT's partner with OneWeb grows over the coming years.

'While it's tempting to think that one technology can solve the problem of the digital divide, there is no single solution to rural broadband.

'Many households are still on ADSL connections and enduring slow speeds unnecessarily, unaware that in many cases they could upgrade to fibre broadband and still save themselves money.

'Anyone who is still battling with slow broadband should run a speed test to find out how reliable the connection really is.

'If you're not happy with the results, run a comparison online and see if you can get both a better deal and a faster service.'

Cox added: 'Before installing satellite broadband, it is a good idea to check if alternatives options are available, even if you can't get access to fixed line broadband.

'If your area is covered by a 4G mobile network, mobile broadband could offer a cheaper and faster way to get connected.

'It works using the same data networks you connect to on your smartphone, and you'll be able to take your internet connection with you wherever you go.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Easy-access savings rates are nudging upwards with providers seemingly jostling for customers.

Investec has increased the rate on its online flexi saver from 0.45 per cent to 0.58 per cent. It comes after Skipton Building Society increased its easy-access rate last week to 0.6 per cent.

Top rates on these bread and butter accounts have been in the 0.4 to 0.5 per cent range for most of the year, since falling from 1 per cent last summer.

Savers now have three easy access savings providers paying in excess of 0.5 per cent to choose from.

Meanwhile, Coventry Building Society also increased its savings rates last week - its limited access saver account now pays 0.55 per cent.

The average easy-access account pays just 0.18 per cent interest, according to Moneyfacts, suggesting that savers can typically triple their rate by moving their cash.

Many savers will be earning far less than this, often with their cash held with large banks paying between 0.01 per cent and 0.06 per cent interest.

Among the worst is HSBC, along with Lloyds (including Halifax) and NatWest with a rate of just 0.01 per cent - just 10p interest a year on £1,000.

The increases from Coventry, Skipton and Investec is good news for savers, according to James Blower, founder of the Savings Guru.

'Firstly, the rates are a big improvement on the 0.4 per cent to 0.5 per cent range that the best buys have been in for most of 2021, since they started to fall from the 1 per cent level last September.

'Secondly, Coventry, Skipton and Investec are larger savings providers so have bigger balance sheets which can support the strong inflows of customers they will see with these rates.

'Whereas some of the small new entrants could only cope with the inflows these rates will generate for a couple of days, it is likely that these three will hold here for a few weeks and possibly into September.

'This increases the likelihood that other banks and building societies will follow suit and increase their rates to compete.

'I'd be surprised if we didn't see at least one more provider join that group paying 0.55 - 0.6 per cent or even possibly go slightly above.'

What should savers consider when choosing an easy access account?

Savers looking for the best easy-access savings deal would be wise to always double check how accessible their cash will be once in the account.

Investec's easy-access account pays interest on balances between £5,000 and £250,000, provides instant access to savings, and allows unlimited deposits and withdrawals to a linked current account.

However, market leader Skipton's easy-access account limits savers to three withdrawals a year whilst Coventry allows six per year after which savers forfeit 50 days interest.

The minimum balance requirements are also a major consideration for savers.

Investec allows unlimited withdrawals, both it and Skipton require £5,000 to open an account as opposed to just £1 for Coventry.

Rachel Springall, personal finance expert at Moneyfacts said: 'Easy-access accounts are ideal for savers who want a flexible pot.

'But two things to keep in mind is that these rates are variable so can change anytime, plus some easy access accounts limit the number of withdrawals you can take within the year.'

One alternative for savers, who are concerned at the prospect of losing access to their cash for a fixed time period, is to opt for a notice account.

Savers can achieve higher returns albeit having to provide a few month's notice to withdraw their cash.

For example Hampshire Trust Bank is currently offering a rate of 0.85 per cent, although savers will need to give 95 days notice to withdraw funds.

Investec is also currently offering a rate of 0.7 per cent which only requires a 35 days notice period in order to withdraw.

Savers who apply via the savings platform, Raisin can also qualify for a welcome bonus payment of up to £50 depending on how much they put in.

For those savers looking to stash away cash for a year or more and don't require access to their cash, better returns can be achieved by turning to a fixed rate deal, where there has been more competition and subsequently far better rates than instant-access.

The best one year fixed rate account, offered by Gatehouse Bank, is currently paying interest of 1.1 per cent, while the best two-year deal by Zopa Bank is paying 1.26 per cent.

Blower said: 'Easy-access accounts are great for savers who want access to their money, are saving for emergencies or are building a savings pot for an event in the near future such as a holiday or wedding.

'However, if you are saving for something with a longer term horizon, or you don't need access, then it's worth looking at a regular savings account, a fixed rate bond, or a notice account where the rates are significantly higher.'

Customers who ditched expensive default or standard variable tariffs in favour of the cheapest on the market could cut their bills by £103 last month.

It was the smallest difference in savings since 2012, energy watchdog Ofgem found.

Last year the cheapest deal cost £338 less than the average default tariff, down from £400 in 2019.

Households can save just a third of what they could a year ago by switching energy supplier

The findings come as Ofgem prepares to raise its price cap, hiking bills by £150 for 15million households.

Avro Energy's Simple and Flow 12-month tariff was the cheapest on the market at £1,035 a year in July, according to comparison site GoCompare.

In the same month in 2020, the cheapest fixed deal was £788 with Outfox The Market.

The current price cap, which limits how much firms can charge customers on standard variable tariffs, is £1,138 a year, based on average usage.

This is expected to rise to £1,288 from October as wholesale prices soar.

Experts are also seeing more fixed-rate energy deals topping the price cap.

Karin Sode, managing director of People's Energy, says: 'No energy supplier can keep their tariffs low any more without them being loss-making.

'Energy suppliers have no choice but to have higher tariffs to cover the costs associated with buying the energy.'

But if they delayed by just five years to when they are 30, they'd need to pay in an extra £133 per month, for a total of £629, while if they delayed a whole decade, this rockets to £830 per month.

These calculations do not include state pension, are adjusted to inflation and based on the assumption of a middle-range 5 per cent annual return on your investments, Nutmeg said.

But an income of £13,000 a year may not be enough - recent research revealed that couples typically need £26,000 and single people need £19,000 a year for a comfortable retirement.

This amount would cover essential bills plus regular short haul holidays, leisure activities, alcohol and charity giving.

So, to have a more comfortable retirement income of £19,000 per year, a 25-year-old would need to save £716 per month, rising to an eyewatering £1,200 if they delayed until 35 and still wanted to stop working at 55, according to research.

How does compounding work? Imagine you put £100 in a savings account and you earn 10 per cent interest on that money. After one year your account will hold £110 (£10 of interest plus £100 capital, or 0.1 x 100 = £10 + £100). Now imagine that you leave the accumulated capital in the account and it again earns 10 per cent interest. By the end of the second year you will have £121 (£11 of interest plus £110 of starting capital, or 0.1 x 110 = £11 + £110). By the end of the third year you will have £133.10 (£12.10 of interest plus £121 of starting capital, or 0.1 x 121 = £12.10 + £121). So, the amount of interest grows because the same percentage is applied to a greater starting amount.

Similarly, a couple that started saving at 25 would need to put a combined sum of £972 away every month to retire at 55 on a £26,000 income. This rises to £1,630 if they delay until they are 35.

Waiting to retire until 65, which is the current average retirement age in the UK, takes the pressure off the contributions.

A 25-year-old would need to save a smaller £479 per month to generate a £19,000 annual income, rising to £716 if they started at 35.

But if

Annabelle Williams, personal finance specialist, Nutmeg, said: 'When things are tight, opting out of pension payments can seem like an easy decision to make.

'However, the later you start building up your pension, the harder it is to catch up later in life and the more you’ll have to be putting away when you’re older.

'This is because you will have missed out on all those years of hopefully good investment performance and the power of compound growth, which is when your investment performance comes on top of previous returns.'

She also said that when contributing to your workplace pension, you'll also benefit from employer contributions.

In general, under auto-enrolment the minimum contribution is 8 per cent - 3 per cent of free cash from your employer, 1 per cent from Government tax relief and the other 4 per cent taken directly from your paycheck.

Some employers go above and beyond those requirements, particularly larger companies. Staff at FTSE 100 firms enjoy average contributions from their employer of 8.7 per cent.

Although 8 per cent is the auto enrolment minimum, financial experts tend to recommend you try to save a total of 12 per cent of your salary if you want a comfortable retirement.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fund manager Douglas Brodie is head of a 'global discovery team' at investment house Baillie Gifford that seeks out companies transforming the way business is done in the industries they operate in. Such 'pioneers', argues Brodie, can prove to be outstanding long-term investments.

The discovery team – currently seven-strong – has been together for more than a decade and the investment strategy has so far reaped huge investor rewards.

The two funds it is responsible for – Baillie Gifford Global Discovery and Edinburgh Worldwide – have both built strong investment records and Brodie believes there is no reason why they cannot continue, irrespective of any market hiccups that lie in wait.

Brodie has been at the helm of the £2.3billion Global Discovery fund since its launch in 2011 and has run the £1.5billion stock market-listed investment trust Edinburgh Worldwide for the past seven years.

Unsurprisingly, the two investment vehicles have similar portfolios – eight of the two funds' top ten holdings are common to both. What distinguishes them is that the trust has a slightly lower ongoing charge and also the ability to borrow cheap money to fund occasional forays into the stock market.

As a result, the trust has a superior five-year performance record to Global Discovery – a return of 259 per cent versus 207 per cent.

'Core to what we do is identify businesses that are harnessing a combination of technology and human ingenuity to effect industry change,' says Brodie. 'These businesses are not simply surviving. They're acting as pioneers, constantly moving things forward.'

Among the two funds' biggest holdings are electric car manufacturer Tesla and online grocer Ocado. 'I've been an investor in Tesla since 2013,' says Brodie.

'I've lived and breathed its multiple evolutions and the constant challenges to its investment case. But it continues to lead the way, innovating on multiple fronts. Similarly, Ocado is using technology and software to turn online grocery shopping into a business that can be provided profitably and at scale.'

New holdings made by the investment trust in the past six months include software company JFrog and Sprout Social which helps companies better manage their social media presence. It has also increased its exposure to space-related stocks with new stakes in satellite manufacturer Astranis Space Technologies and rocket manufacturer Relativity Space.

Brodie says this year has been a 'dynamic active period' for stock markets, what with the emergence of day traders prepared to take on hedge fund managers and the widespread use of special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) to buy businesses that are then listed on the stock market.

He describes all this as 'froth' and says he would welcome a market shake-out if it were to remove the 'ill-perceived' idea held by some investors that equities are a one-way bet.

'Whatever happens to stock markets short term,' he adds, 'I am convinced that the technology journey we are now on is not going away. I am not nervous about that.

'The application and deployment of technology across swathes of industry is here to stay.'

Edinburgh Worldwide has some 110 holdings with nearly two thirds of its portfolio invested in the US. It has stakes in 11 unlisted companies, representing some 8 per cent of the trust's assets, and its ongoing annual charge is just above 0.7 per cent. Its stock market identification code is BHSRZC8 and its ticker is EWI.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Although the Japanese stock market reached a 30-year high in February, fund managers believe the outlook for equities remains positive.

Equity prices, they argue, continue to look cheap compared to other markets such as the United States where share prices have increased seven-fold over the same period.

Masaki Taketsume, the London-based manager of Schroder Japan Growth, is among those who believe the Japanese stock market has more to offer investors, both short and long term.

The £253million trust he manages is listed on the UK stock market and invested in 69 companies including some familiar names such as Hitachi, Nippon, Sumitomo and Toyota.

In the shorter term, Taketsume is encouraged by the Japanese government's recent ramping up of the Covid-19 vaccination programme.

It means more than a million people are now being vaccinated every day in Japan. 'Consumer sentiment is definitely improving as a result,' he says, 'which is good for the stock market.'

While the 2020 Summer Olympics later this month in Tokyo has yet to capture the nation's imagination, Taketsume believes the mere fact that it is taking place will boost consumer sentiment further.

'As long as the government can keep Covid-19 infections down to a manageable level, I am sure the Olympics will have a positive impact,' he predicts.

He is also encouraged by the fact that the pandemic has forced many Japanese companies to somewhat belatedly embrace the internet – a move that should improve levels of productivity.

Long term, Taketsume is encouraged by the efforts many companies are making to become more shareholder-friendly – for example, by improving the returns on shareholders' capital and paying investors higher dividends.

'Corporate governance is improving and it's providing a strong tailwind for share prices,' he says.

Last week, a survey of managers of Japanese funds by the Association of Investment Companies identified corporate governance reform as the biggest cause for optimism.

Taeko Setaishi, investment adviser to fund Atlantis Japan Growth, said that 'international and domestic investors alike are expected to respond positively to Japan's continuing corporate governance reforms'.

Schroder Japan Growth's performance record is not exemplary when compared with its peers.

Although it has enjoyed a good past year – generating a total return of 26 per cent – its long-term record is inferior to that of rivals.

Japanese investment trusts run by Baillie Gifford, Fidelity and JPMorgan all have superior five-year records.

Trust scrutineer Fund Calibre rates Baillie Gifford Japan as an 'elite' fund because of the management team's disciplined investment approach and the trust's competitive annual charges of around 0.7 per cent.

In comparison, Schroder's fund has an equivalent charge of 0.92 per cent. Over the past five years, the trusts have generated respective returns of 110 and 58 per cent.

Taketsume is part of a 16-strong team at Schroders that scrutinises the Japanese stock market, most of whom are based in Tokyo.

The trust's share price stands at a double-digit discount to its asset value, which could look attractive to investors who believe it will narrow as the Japanese stock market continues in recovery mode.

For the year to date, the Nikkei 225, Japan's main stock market index, is up six per cent – 29 per cent over the past 12 months. The trust's stock market identification code is 0802284 and its London Stock Exchange symbol (ticker) is SJG.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investment fund Artemis Income benefits from three pairs of hands on the tiller – Adrian Frost, Nick Shenton and Andy Marsh.

Between them, they have run the fund for 31 years, but their considerable experience didn't stop the £4.8billion UK equity income fund from being caught up in last year's round of dividend cuts across UK plc.

They were forced to trim its dividend payment for 2020 – paid bi-annually – by 26 per cent although the cut was less than the 44 per cent reduction experienced by the UK stock market as a whole.

The first dividend payment for 2021 is 9% higher than the equivalent payment last year

Yet the managers remain in buoyant mood. The first dividend payment for 2021, to be paid at the end of next month, is 9 per cent higher than the equivalent payment last year and Shenton is confident the fund can generate 10 per cent dividend growth for the year as a whole.

'As fund managers of an equity income fund, we have faced headwinds for the past five years,' he says. 'But with Brexit out of the way, and the economy emerging from lockdown, we are now beginning to feel the benefit of a tailwind.'

Over the past year, the fund has generated an overall return for investors of 28 per cent. The fund is invested in 50 stocks, most of which are listed in the UK.

The key to investment success, says Shenton, is identifying companies capable of delivering sufficient cash to both pay shareholders a dividend and meet interest on any outstanding debt.

'It's all about sustainable cash flow,' he adds. 'Often that results from companies employing new technology to create value.'

The team generally hold shares for six years or more, although Shenton says the pandemic provided the opportunity for the three of them to 'ease out some of the looser bricks' while investing in a few companies on their watch list.

The fund is invested in 50 stocks, most of which are listed in the UK

This resulted in positions in HSBC, Vivendi, Shell and Experian being disposed of.

New holdings were taken in Burberry, Next and Pearson, while the managers used the fund's ability to invest in a limited number of overseas companies (capped at 20 per cent) to buy shares in US tech giant Cisco and Japanese games company Nintendo.

Although Adrian Frost is the senior manager – having been involved with the fund since 2002 – there is no hierarchy, with all three able to buy stocks they like for the fund.

'We all have the same investment philosophy,' says Andy Marsh.

'We're stock pickers at heart which means we're constantly searching for outstanding businesses that we can invest in.

'We challenge each other all the time and share responsibility for every decision we take.'

The only framework they adhere to is a portfolio that is diversified across industries (with no more than 15 per cent in any one sector), with individual holdings rarely exceeding five per cent of the fund's value (3i Group is the only current holding above five per cent).

The fund does not invest in unquoted stocks.

Independent investment fund ratings company FundCalibre categorises Artemis Income as an 'elite' fund, stating it has been a 'stalwart' of the UK equity income sector for two decades and possesses 'an excellent team, a strong process and a long-term track record'.

Since launch in June 2000, it has comfortably outperformed the FTSE All-Share Index, delivering an average annual return of 8.8 per cent compared to the index's 4.7 per cent return.

The annual dividend is equivalent to 3.27 per cent, the ongoing annual charges are 0.8 per cent, and the stock market identification code is: B2PLJH1.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One lucky Premium Bond holder has become a millionaire with one of the smallest ever holdings to win.

The woman from Devon has £1,001 in Premium Bonds and was one of the two Premium Bond holders this month to scoop the £1million jackpot.

The popular National Savings and Investment product allows savers to stick up to £50,000 in the accounts and roughly one in three of the population hold them.

Magic number: With more than 111bn bond numbers eligible to win the chances of winning one of the two £1m prizes per £1 bond are over one in 55.5bn (picture posed by model)

The odds of each individual Bond number winning any prize are currently 34,500 to one.

Of the 464 Premium Bonds millionaires on record, just 12 others have won the £1million jackpot with a smaller overall holding.

The woman purchased the winning Bond in July 2020, meaning that it has won the jackpot in the 12th draw that it was eligible to do so.

Jill Waters, retail director at NS&I, said: 'The winner from Devon shows that, no matter how much you hold in Premium Bonds, you're always in with a shot at winning the £1 million jackpot.

'Each and every £1 Bond has an equal opportunity, which is what the magic of Premium Bonds is all about.'

The second Bond number drawn belongs to a woman from Wales, holding a total of £10,051 in Premium Bonds and her winning Bond was an automatically reinvested prize from a previous Premium Bonds £100 prize win in March 2013.

Winners can choose to either have prizes they win paid directly into their bank account or reinvested into more Premium Bonds.

Waters said: 'Our winner from Wales scooped the jackpot with a Bond that was reinvested from a prize win in March 2013.

'I'm sure that our winner from Wales will be banging the drum for having prizes automatically reinvested into more Premium Bonds now that she's a millionaire after choosing that option.'

On top of the two £1 million prizes, there were five winners of the £100,000 prize, 11 winners of the £50,000 prize and 21 winners of the £25,000 prize.

Around 3.2million prizes worth close to £93million will be paid out from this month's draw with more than 111billion bond numbers eligible, up from just circa 110billion in June and 109billion in June.

Many people have continued to pile into Premium Bonds during the pandemic, although demand has waned since NS&I cut the number of prizes in December last year.

In March 2020, prior to lockdown restrictions, there were just over 86billion eligible bonds for the draw, meaning almost £25billion has been put into Premium Bonds since the pandemic began.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When my 92-year-old mother died last September, as Executor of her will for the family, I informed NS&I of her death and received a payment amounting to £6 and was informed there were no outstanding prizes for the bonds.

However, I have in my possession bonds amounting to £9.

I have written, emailed and rang NS&I numerous times explaining the situation – but the answer I get is 'without the bond holder's signed authority' they cannot disclose any information. I am presuming the holder was probably my father who died in 1999.

Premium Bond prizes range from £25 to £1 million and are all tax-free.

I have explained this to them and given an address where he lived when the bonds were purchased. They sent me form NS&I 71 – changing your details? Do I put heaven as his new address?

All I really want to know, as an Executor, is there any unclaimed prizes for the bonds – which need to be dealt with or can I forget the £3 in bonds – as it has cost more in time and postage corresponding with them.

Ed Magnus of this is Money replies: With about one in three of the UK population - over 22million people - holding Premium Bonds, there will likely be many others facing a similar dilemma to yourself.

Britain's best loved savings product has been around since 1956 and although the chance of winning a prize is remote – at 34,500 to 1 for every £1 bond - with up to £1 million potentially at stake it is still worth the effort of checking.

NS&I pay out around three million prizes every month to Bond holders, whose numbers are generated at random.

Almost 3.2million prizes worth close to £92million were paid out in this month's draw with more than 110 billion bond numbers eligible.

Prizes range from £25 to £1 million and are all tax-free.

Although there are only two £1 million prizes on offer each month, there are also five £100,000 prizes, 11 £50,000 prizes and 20 prizes worth £25,000.

Premium Bonds are grouped under a single holder's number and this number has 10 or 9 digits, or 8 digits followed by a letter.

If you believe the Premium Bonds belong to your late father but have no holder number then you can use NS&I's Tracing Service.

This requires filling in a form, which will include as much information as possible, such as previous names and previous addresses.

However, a speedier approach enabling you to both trace and claim the individual bond numbers, without too much back and forth, would be to submit a Bereavement claim form.

As an executor you can do this either online or by post without needing to create an online account with NS&I.

Even without a holder number, the advice is to include as much information as possible, such as previous names and previous addresses so that NS&I can trace the account to your father.

NS&I may then request a Grant of Representation - also known as a Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of Administration - once it has received your completed form.

If opting to send everything by post, the executor must have a registrar's copy of the death certificate (original or a certified copy) and the Will (original of a copy certified by the solicitor).

You then will need to download, print out and complete the bereavement claims form and send to NS&I, Sunderland, SR43 2SB.

If they then require a copy of the death certificate, they will contact you.

Our reader's issue was solved in the process of investigating his query.

They received a letter from NS&I saying the bonds were registered to their father and that there were no outstanding prizes on the holdings.

However, NS&I came back with some further advice for those in a similar situation.

What happens when a Premium Bonds customer dies?

An NS&I spokesperson replies: If an NS&I customer dies, Premium Bonds cannot be inherited or transferred to another person.

Info you'll need when filling in a claim form • The customer's personal details (full name, address, date of birth, date and place of death) • Spouse name (if applicable) • Full name of the executor(s) if there is a Will, or administrators if there is no Will (if you're obtaining a Grant of Administration or Confirmation of Executor Dative) • Type of NS&I account(s) the customer held • Details of the person who is making the claim • Bank account details to pay the money in to

However, they can remain in the monthly Premium Bonds draws for up to 12 months after the customer has died.

After the 12-month period has elapsed, the face value of the Premium Bonds will be repaid to the deceased customer's estate, along with any prizes they may win in this 12-month period.

To keep the Bonds in the draw, the person responsible for the deceased customer's finances should tell us this on the death claims form that they fill out.

Any Premium Bonds prizes won will be paid by prize cheque after that prize draw to the person entitled to the money - the estate's executor.

We will hold on to any outstanding prizes won until we have completed the death claim and then they will be issued.

Once the death claim has been completed, we will then send any future prizes won by cheque after each prize draw to the person entitled to the money.

We can't pay these prizes electronically or consolidate them and pay them at the end of the 12 months.

What would you advise our reader?

An NS&I spokesperson replies: In this case, if the Premium Bonds did belong to the reader's late father and he passed away in 1999, then they would have stopped being eligible for the draws at some point in the year 2000.

Provided that the reader is the beneficiary of their late father's estate, then they are entitled to the repayment of the holding, which they can claim using the above death claims form.

Additionally, and as outlined above, they would be entitled to the original holding, plus any prizes that may have been won up to 12 months after their late father passed away.

If the reader prefers to complete a paper form, they can call us on 08085 007 007 and a member of our team will be happy to arrange for one to be sent.

NS&I will let the person responsible for the estate know if a Grant of Representation (also known as a Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of Administration) is required once the completed Death Claims form has been received.

What if they have no holder number?

An NS&I spokesperson replies: If customers do not have a holder's number, this is not a problem when using the service if they will have the original Bond certificates.

In cases where customers do not have any paperwork and suspect they have Premium Bonds, they should provide NS&I with as much information as possible to enable any holding to be traced.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cyber security, protecting firms and citizens, is both necessary and controversial. Barely a day passes without grim tales of digital extortion.

Poly Network, which links digital ledgers across the globe, says hackers looted some £432million of cryptocurrency.

Israel’s NSO Group provided cyber security software to autocratic clients who promptly used it to snoop on opponents and world leaders.

Cyber spree: Poly Network, which links digital ledgers across the globe, has just revealed that hackers looted some £432bn of cryptocurrency

The boom in cyber abuse explains why London-quoted, Prague-based Avast has fallen into the hands of Arizona competitor Norton for up to £6.2billion.

As one of the few cyber firms quoted in London, Avast has attracted a big institutional following.

Unlike Britain’s undervalued aerospace and defence companies, Meggitt and Ultra, the cyber firm sells at a premium to its counterparts on Nasdaq.

When cyber software group Darktrace did an initial public offering this year there was scepticism because it was backed by Mike Lynch, currently fighting extradition to the US over fraudulent accounting allegations.

Investors who backed Darktrace have been rewarded, with the shares spurting from 330p to 617p in latest trading, placing a market value of £4.3billion on the enterprise.

At its core, Avast is a Czech rather than a UK enterprise, so it is hard to criticise the merger with Norton on security grounds.

UK funds which enthusiastically embraced Avast might have a beef. There is almost no premium involved in the transaction.

Contrast this with the bidding war for aerospace group Meggitt, where the premium is above 70 per cent.

The industrial case for the deal is stronger than the financial justification. Together, the two companies will have 500m-plus users focused on cyber safety.

Microsoft is a big customer for Avast software. But the Silicon Valley giants increasingly are building their own cyber defences into products.

As time marches on they are as likely to be competitors rather than customers, so scale provided by a Norton-Avast combination would be useful.

The deal is described as a ‘merger’ but in effect it is a takeover, with Avast shareholders being offered Norton cash and paper.

Avast chief executive Ondrej Vlcek will be president, working alongside his opposite number Vincent Pilette at Norton. Such doubling up of roles rarely works for long. In an age when big battalion investors have become used to FTSE premiums, the weak takeout price could well trigger a revolt.

Raw deal

Nigel Rudd is among the great City dealmakers. In his early years at Williams Holdings it was all about buying companies at the best price.

Latterly, he has earned the sobriquet ‘Sir Sell-off’ for his skill in disposing of solid British enterprises such as Pilkington, Boots and Invensys at fancy prices.

It looked as if he was onto a sure-fire winner when he agreed to take the American shilling and sell Meggitt to Parker-Hannifin.

The shares’ 70 per cent premium appeared hard to better and Parker, which already has similar sized operations in Britain, is a respected Rolls-Royce supplier.

Broader implications of loss of UK intellectual property, skills and R&D, the impact on national security and the potential for vanishing corporation tax are skimmed over.

Rudd and the other independent directors at Meggitt have been too clever for their own good. They jumped in Parker’s direction without even considering whether there might be a better deal.

Along comes Transdigm, which proclaims a private equity business model, to interfere, offering a 900p a share – an extra pound. Meggitt’s board says the Parker offer remains ‘an attractive’ proposition.

The reality is that a different chairman to Rudd might have kept Parker at a distance and gone it alone. Now the board risks being hoist on its own fiduciary petard.

All’s Wells

Mike Wells has done a good job in breaking up the Prudential.

But it is not done just yet. The latest earnings are more than wiped out by a chunky £5.4billion goodwill writedown at US offshoot Jackson Life, which is being spun out.

The Pru also plans a capital-raising of up to £2.2billion as it continues its exciting Asian expansion. Canadian-born he may be, but chief executive Wells appreciates the virtue of a trusted British brand.

At a time of geopolitical uncertainty in Hong Kong and China, he also recognises the value of a City HQ and quote.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Senior's board received a vote of confidence as analysts said it had made the right call to turn down a string of takeover offers.

The FTSE 250 aerospace and defence group has been one of the few companies approached by private equity to stand its ground and refuse to accept a deal.

It turned down a whopping five proposed bids from Texas-based Lone Star, the last of which valued the company at £840million, or 200p per share.

FTSE 250 aerospace and defence group Senior has been one of the few companies approached by private equity to stand its ground and refuse to accept a deal

But calculations from Peel Hunt brokers estimate Boeing-supplier Senior could be worth as much as 303p per share – equal to £1.27billion – if it was bought by another aerospace company.

Senior would be worth the extra money if it was bought by a ‘trade buyer’ rather than a financial firm such as private equity because the merged companies would probably be able to save costs in a number of areas and increase sales.

Mid-cap companies in the sector have been hot property for overseas buyers in the last two years.

Stock Watch - Powerhouse Energy Group Powerhouse Energy Group surged after it bought a stake in an engineering consultancy co-founded and run by its chief technical officer Paul Emmitt. Powerhouse – which specialises in converting plastic waste into hydrogen – bought 48pc of Engsolve for just under £100,000. The two companies have worked together for around four years and Powerhouse said the tie-up would ensure Bridgend-based Engsolve would keep supporting its projects. Engsolve’s turnover was around £840,000 in the year to March. AIM-listed Powerhouse closed up 15.1 per cent, or 0.55p, to 4.2p.

Cobham was swept up last year by private equity group Advent International, which is also trying to buy Ultra Electronics (up 2.2 per cent, or 66p, to 3086p) and Meggitt (down 1.5 per cent, or 12p, to 818p) is being wooed by two bidders.

Peel Hunt analysts said: ‘In our view, this means that the remaining UK aerospace and defence stocks, which include Senior, Chemring and Qinetiq, offer somewhat of a scarcity value and demand is clearly evident for undervalued aerospace assets.’

Peel Hunt’s conclusions give weight to comments from Senior boss David Squires, who maintained throughout the process that Lone Star’s approaches ‘fundamentally undervalued’ the company, which has been hit by the aerospace downturn this year.

Earlier this month, Senior managed to turn a profit and said there were ‘clear signs of recovery’ on the way.

Senior shares rose 4.2 per cent, or 7.2p, to 180.7p last night, while FTSE 250 peers Chemring rose 0.2 per cent, or 0.5p, to 330p and Qinetiq by 0.2 per cent, or 0.8p, to 338p. The mid-cap index fell, however, by 0.04 per cent, or 10.06 points, to 23746.77.

The FTSE 100 was also in the red, down 0.4 per cent, or 26.91 points, at 7193.23 as miners and energy giants fell.

The moves came as the The International Energy Agency cut its forecasts for global oil demand ‘sharply’ for the rest of this year as the delta variant spreads.

The outlook is a sharp reversal for the agency, which was urging Opec to increase production just last month.

The analysis also jars with Wednesday’s call from the US – the IEA’s most influential member – for Opec and its allies to ramp production up faster.

As a result Shell lost 1.8 per cent, or 27.2p, to 1454.2p and BP was off 1.5 per cent, or 4.75p, at 306.95p.

In the second tier, and Tui shares were down 1.1 per cent, or 3.5p, to 329p despite signs that the pandemic travel recovery is fully under way.

Tui bookings have jumped by 1.5m since May, primarily driven by bookings from continental Europe. But the holiday firm’s boss said frequent UK rule changes had deterred people.

Friedrich Joussen pointed to the UK’s decision to add Portugal to the list of green travel destinations in mid-May before removing it in early June. ‘When you change the programme so often, then people cancel,’ he added.

Another steep faller was retailer McColl’s after the company warned on profits, blaming a shortage of delivery drivers.

A company spokesman said: ‘Revenues have been impacted by availability issues in stores over recent months due to supply chain disruption. This has been caused by the widely publicised nationwide shortage of delivery drivers due to a combination of external factors.’

Shares tumbled 25.5 per cent, or 7.4p, to 21.6p.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In recent weeks, our family moved to a larger home, within the same small village and just two minutes from our previous two bedroom apartment.

We have undertaken all the usual things you do when moving including mail redirection, electoral roll registration, renewing driving licences, adjusting insurance policies.

However, I discovered that my insurer would no longer offer cover. They stated my policy would be cancelled with zero refund and four months to go on the term.

It seems quite incredible that I must now declare, when applying for new cover, that my car insurance was previously cancelled. What can I do?

One motorist had his insurance cancelled after moving home - with no explanation given

Grace Gausden, This is Money, replies: There are many reasons why an insurer decides to cancel, refuse or void your car insurance policy.

Common reasons include non-payment, non-disclosure and fraud.

In this instance, we decided not to name the insurer.

However, you are still not sure why your policy was cancelled as your husband's was changed with minimum fuss.

You suspect it may be that crime rates are slightly higher in your new area but it shouldn't be a marked change as you moved only a couple of minutes away from your old property.

Not only are you now questioning how the insurance industry can penalise those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in this situation but also worrying that this means you will be punished moving forward for having a policy cancelled.

As you say, this is a different situation to a policy being cancelled due to a serious infraction.

Insurance cancellation is something drivers have to declare with every new insurance provider.

Unfortunately, this often serves as a red flag and as a result, you may find premiums are much higher or that mainstream insurance suppliers may not want to cover you at all.

This is Money asked insurers what drivers in your situation can do as you feel it is unfair you are made to suffer despite not doing anything wrong.

Many said without knowing the exact circumstances it would be difficult to comment but did offer advice whilst others said what their policy is on premiums being cancelled without warning.

A spokesperson for Admiral said: 'All insurance companies will have their own underwriting criteria and decide what risks they are willing to provide cover for.

'If the customer's last insurer cancelled his policy because they couldn't offer cover for the new address, then we wouldn't expect a customer to declare this.

'If this was the case, then the policy was cancelled due to the underwriting conditions set by the insurance company.

'There are some occasions when we would require a customer to declare why they've had insurance cancelled, for example if it was cancelled due to non-payment or a breach of the terms of the policy.'

Each insurer has their own underwriting criteria which could leave customers with no cover

A spokesperson for Direct Line replied: 'We review every policy on an individual basis and if a customer's circumstances change, then we encourage them to contact us as soon as possible to ensure that their policy is reflective of both their needs and their correct information.

'There are a number of rating factors that are considered when offering a policy to a customer, which is why it is important that a customer makes us aware of any changes as soon as they are aware of them.

'It's important that the customer checks with their insurer as to the reasons why the policy was cancelled and whether this is going to affect them with future quotes. Although in some cases, should a customer's policy get cancelled then this would need to be notified.'

Meanwhile, Compare the Market said you will need to disclose the policy cancellation within the relevant question in most insurance question sets.

It added many insurers would likely not provide a quote, and those who do may charge a higher price.

If you think your car insurance was cancelled wrongly or unfairly, you can make a complaint to the insurer - or at the least gain a final reason for cancellation ahead of doing that.

Ryan Fulthorpe, of GoCompare car insurance, said: 'Insurers take in many factors when deciding whether they can insure a driver and address is a major part of that.

'Some insurers may not want to cover certain postcodes at all, and that's when some drivers can come up against issues.

'By law you have to update a change of address with the DVLA or you could be liable for a £1,000 fine, while not updating your address with your car insurer could invalidate your insurance so it is very important to always give accurate information to your insurer and the DVLA.

'But doing so could mean an increase or a drop in the cost of your car insurance, or in this reader's case, a rejection of the policy.

'Different insurers look at the risk factors of car insurance in a different way, so it's important to shop around for your car insurance to ensure best policy and best price – even when you move house.

'Drivers must always take reasonable care to disclose all relevant information when applying for insurance, otherwise this could lead to a declined claim or a cancelled policy.'

A spokesperson for Aviva added: 'We consider a wide range of risk factors when calculating motor insurance premiums, including the driving experience of the customer, the usage of the vehicle and the address at which the vehicle is kept or where it is usually parked when not in use – for example, in a garage, on a driveway or on the road outside the property.

'The latter point allows us to assess the likelihood of incidents such as theft or malicious damage when the vehicle is not in use.

'If a customer moves house, the level of risk associated with the vehicle may change.

'This could mean that the motor premium may fall or rise in line with this altered risk, or in a very small number of cases, we may no longer be able to offer cover at a new address.

'In this scenario, we would continue cover until the date of the move, but we would inform the customer that we would no longer be able to insure the vehicle after the move has taken place.'

Where drivers park their car & which area they live in can depend on whether they get insured

A spokesperson for Hastings Direct said: 'The stance on what constitutes a cancelled policy for declaration purposes will vary by insurance provider.

'In this particular example, Hastings Direct would not deem cancellation of a customer's previous insurance due to the insurer not covering a new address as a declarable reason of cancellation.

'Generally speaking, insurers are more concerned with situations where customers have had insurance cancelled due to fraud or not adhering to policy terms.

'As such, individual assessment so that they can consider the circumstances behind the cancellation is key to an insurance provider making an informed and fair decision on whether to provide cover.'

Grace Gausden, This is Money, adds: For drivers who believe their policy has been cancelled unfairly, they can complain to their insurer and set out their reasons why.

If you don't reach a satisfactory resolution, you can always take your case to the Financial Ombudsman who will review the evidence and make a judgment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The global shortage of a vital component, found in items as diverse as toasters and MRI scanners, could serve as an alert to update your portfolio – as long as you have a taste for technology and geopolitical risk.

The scarce commodity in question is the microchip, also known as a chip or semiconductor.

Chips are the heart of the ever-increasing array of electronic devices on which our lives depend, including toasters and MRI scanners, but also washing machines, laptops and mobile phones.

Shortage: Chips are the heart of the ever-increasing array of electronic devices on which our lives depend

Chips are also essential for artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics and 5G infrastructure which are all set for vast expansion. As one would-be wit put it: 'It's chips in everything.'

The multiplicity of uses helps explain why the crisis in supply, sparked by the pandemic, was dubbed 'Chipmaggedon'.

As Covid spread, some chip companies cut output, even as people raced to buy new gadgets. Subsequently manufacturers have also been hampered by factors like drought (their processes require lots of water).

The resulting rise in chip prices has been good for shares in semiconductor companies. But the automotive industry has suffered.

Infineon, the German semiconductor group, estimates there is an average of $434 of content in a petrol car and $834 worth of semiconductors in an electric vehicle.

Unable to secure sufficient chips, motor manufacturers may lose an estimated $110billion in sales this year. To offset this, they are raising the cost of some models – one reason why car hire is more expensive this summer.

The availability of chips may be slightly improving, but a fall-off in demand is not expected.

Instead, the mighty Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) forecasts a 'structural and fundamental increase' and is planning $100bn in capital expenditure over the next three years.

TSMC is the world's largest 'fabricator' or manufacturer. It controls 84pc of the market in the most sophisticated chips.

TSMC made its stock market debut in 1997 when there were about 28 other major fabricators, as Michael Flitton co-manager of the Cerno Pacific fund explains: 'As a result of inexorable consolidation, there are three today – TSMC, Samsung in Korea and Intel from the US. We own TSMC and Samsung because these companies have deep economic moats, making it difficult for others compete, given the multi-million cost of lithography machines from ASML.'

Shares in this Dutch group, the world's number one in its field, have soared by 57 per cent this year.

Mounting excitement over the prospects for ASML and TSMC lie behind the 57 per cent rise over the past year in the PHLX Semiconductor Index of companies in every semiconductor activity. Most analysts are bullish. But anyone venturing into the sector must be aware that its geopolitical background is as complicated as any video game (yes, another thing that needs microchips).

The stance of governments is set to have even more of an influence on the direction of share prices: the possible threat posed by China to Taiwan is key to understanding TSMC's strategy, for example.

How and where politicians will become involved is impossible to predict. The fate of Arm, the British semiconductor designer, is a case in point. Arm, owned by the Japanese conglomerate Softbank, is being snapped up by Nvidia, the Californian group. But the Government is yet to intervene, although it is again reviewing another less controversial deal – the Chinese takeover of Newport Wafer Fab, the chip producer.

Chris Ford of the Sanlam AI fund, which holds some semiconductor stocks, warns of the potential impact of tensions between superpowers with the sector becoming 'something of a battleground between the US and China'.

An extra political dimension makes any investment even more interesting for me. Investors who feel the same – and can contemplate a gamble – can gain some exposure to semiconductors through two exchange traded funds: Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor.

US banks are particularly enthusiastic about the prospects for semiconductors. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs rate Samsung and TSMC, while Bank of America likes ASML, Applied Materials, NXP Semiconductors and ON Semiconductor.

The last two supply auto manufacturers which, like so many other industries, can go nowhere without semiconductors since they are the building blocks of our future. If you'd like to know more about the science behind this, ASML's website provides an intelligible guide.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Millions of pounds could be flowing out of the UK every week as a result of private equity firms' reliance on tax havens, analysis shows.

The top ten largest private equity groups operating in Britain all have links to offshore financial hubs, research by the Labour Party found.

Cinven, Paperchase-rescuer Permira, Apax and the recently listed Bridgepoint, which was spun out of Natwest Bank in 2000, all use complicated corporate structures that involves them having funds or holding companies in the likes of Guernsey and Luxembourg.

Offshore: Firms use complicated corporate structures that involves them having funds or holding companies in the likes of Guernsey (pictured) and Luxembourg

Private equity firms claim they use them because it is an easier way to manage the array of companies they often own or fund around the world.

But campaigners and politicians say the structures make it difficult to know how much tax revenue the Treasury is missing out on.

These missing revenues could be used to fund the UK's recovery from Covid, which has seen the Government plough billions into support programmes to keep the country and businesses functioning.

James Murray, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The Treasury are standing by when they should be cracking down on millions leaving their coffers.

'The Chancellor has been turning a blind eye as British businesses face being undermined by tech giants who don't pay their tax, or being taken over by risky private equity companies.

'We want the Government to change course.'

HG and former Rolls-Royce investor Invest Industrial both have links with Luxembourg, BC Partners with Guernsey, and Triton, Vitruvian and IK Invest with Jersey.

Robert Palmer, executive director of campaign group Tax Justice UK, said: 'Private equity companies often asset strip when they buy British businesses, while at the same time finding very clever ways of paying little or no tax.

'This reduces money flowing into the Treasury and can often destroy good companies,' he said.

'The Government should be closing tax loopholes that allow this behaviour.

'Right now the Government is working out how to build back from the pandemic and it seems to me that private equity is ripe to be paying more in tax.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What's happening?

Back in the 1970s, when some of us were irresponsibly growing our hair and wearing loon pants, I remember seeing the horror on my father's face when he realised just how much of his retirement money had disappeared.

This was not through any stupid investment decisions on his part, but as a result of the economic catastrophe that was rampant inflation in our economy.

Pathetic politicians seemed powerless in the face of this economic acid, which dissolved the value of assets.

Digging deep: While commodities may not be very popular in terms of environmental issues, they do provide a good hedge against rising inflation

For a short period it peaked at just under 25 per cent per annum, which had such a dreadful effect on the economy, that the term 'banana republic' seemed almost applicable.

Why Does It Matter?

You might think this is a history lesson and that the current level of inflation is nowhere near the Seventies nightmare.

But inflation requires constant vigilance. Too much is disastrous, just as deflation (falling prices) also can be. What we actually need is Goldilocks inflation, which is a bit like her bears' best porridge, neither too hot nor too cold. Sadly, Goldilocks is fiction and so lukewarm inflation is not easy to achieve consistently.

Recently the governor of the Bank of England thought that UK inflation may well be around 4 per cent this year but thereafter hopefully keep to his target of 2 per cent. I hope he is right, but some of the indicators point to a potentially more dangerous scenario.

What Should I Do?

With interest rates effectively at 0 per cent, we are losing value in real terms on our deposit accounts, and so people have been tempted to turn to other offerings purporting to provide 'real' returns higher than inflation. The stock market should technically provide a better return, but the FTSE 100 yield is still only around 3.27 per cent.

There are things we can do. First, there are government inflation-proof bonds which will at least match inflation.

Alternatively there are some companies whose value will actually benefit from periods of inflation.

We have seen commodity prices rising this year with both oil and gas up strongly, and although this is unlikely to be repeated in the short term, commodity prices are often one of base causes for inflation.

Also, of course ,the question of gold comes in here, as probably the oldest investment to beat inflation from Cleopatra to Covid.

While commodities may not be very popular in terms of environmental issues, they do provide a good hedge against rising inflation, especially if you think that the global economy will continue its recovery following its cardiac arrest last year.

Any Suggestions?

One simple way to address this is through the Blackrock World Mining Trust, which provides a well-diversified entry into the commodity mining sector.

If, though, you would prefer a greater gold focus, then the iShares Physical Gold ETC, which is backed by the real stuff and is invested in just one inflation proof entity – the yellow metal.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's biggest banks are thrashing out a major deal to create hundreds of shared branches in towns and villages they have left behind, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Banks are in advanced talks about setting up community banking hubs to protect swathes of the country from being cut off and unable to access cash or stay on top of their day-to-day finances.

Sources said the banks are set to agree to a five-year deal to cover the costs of shared sites where customers of any large bank can pay in or withdraw cash and carry out transactions.

New beginning?: It is thought that every branch closure can save a bank up to £1million over five years

The only significant sticking point is a row over how much each bank will pay, an insider has revealed.

The Mail on Sunday has for decades called on banks to share sites as they have shut an increasing number of their least profitable branches across the country. Our Keep Our Cash campaign is calling for every town to have at least one bank.

Last night one source close to the discussions warned that banks may seize on the initiative and trigger a huge new wave of individual branch closures.

The source said it could give banks the perfect cover to reduce their overall networks closer to around 400 branches each. This is seen in the industry as the ideal size because it gives banks an outpost in all major population centres in Britain, the source said.

It is thought that every branch closure can save a bank up to £1million over five years. Lloyds currently has 1,567 branches, Barclays has 755, NatWest has 833, HSBC has 540 and Santander has 452.

If they slashed their networks to just 400 each, it would mean shutting as many as 2,147 branches between them.

They could then tell customers to use a much smaller number of shared banking hubs.

The MoS understands that the Financial Conduct Authority regulator is putting huge pressure on lenders to sign up to an agreement by Christmas – or potentially face tough legislation banning branch closures entirely.

The Post Office is overseeing a trial of shared bank branches, which ends next month.

Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, who sits on the influential Treasury Select Committee of MPs, said: 'When banks are in trouble, the taxpayers help them out, but when times are good they aren't there for their customers. Banks have recently announced a huge improvement in profits and I think it's time they stump up.'

Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays, Santander and NatWest have all been steadily chipping away at the size of their networks in recent years and Chancellor Rishi Sunak has promised to pass laws aimed at ensuring that everyone who relies on cash can access it.

Officials are understood to believe that a new generation of shared banking hubs is vital to protect vulnerable people from being left without access to banking altogether.

EY and Pinsent Masons have been advising banks in discussions. There are around 500 towns across the country that only have one bank branch left, according to research shared with the banks in discussions. The analysis found that between 150 and 200 locations would be severely cut off if the last branch in town was axed.

As a result, these areas are most likely to be in line for a shared banking hub.

The MoS understands that a community might qualify for a shared branch if it has a large population within about a mile and a quarter of the proposed site. There would also need to be a large number of people who rely on branches for banking.

Research provided to the banks by consultancy firm Frontier Economics has estimated that each shared branch would cost £250,000 to set up and run over five years.

The customers' banks might have to pay transaction fees estimated to be about £50,000 per year.

This would create a total cost of £100million for 200 sites, which the Treasury is calling on the big banks to fund.

But the banks are arguing about their share of the costs amid fears that these could spiral if more communities are later awarded a shared branch. Sparsely populated rural areas might fail to qualify for access to a banking hub as there may be too little demand to justify the running costs.

People in those places may instead be encouraged to access banking services through the 11,500-strong Post Office branch network.

A Treasury spokesman said it was consulting on new laws 'to make sure people only need to travel a reasonable distance to pay in or take out cash'. The spokesman said 'industry initiatives' would 'need to be compatible' with the legislation.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Happy days: Jackie Weaver would give more funding to parish councils if she were made Chancellor of the Exchequer

Jackie Weaver would give more funding to parish councils if she were made Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The 69-year-old shot to fame earlier this year after she kicked argumentative male councillors off an explosive Zoom meeting of Handforth parish council in Cheshire.

As chief officer of the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, she remained cool and unflustered when one man told her: 'You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver.'

Another shouted: 'Read the standing orders! Read them and understand them!'

She says that financially, her new-found fame after the video footage went viral on the internet has made little difference to her life although she can now earn up to £5,000 for half a day's work.

Her book of common sense advice, You Do Have Authority Here, is out next month and her humorous podcast Jackie Weaver Has The Authority is available to listen to now.

What did your parents teach you about money?

To save it. They were cautious with money and thought you should put it away for a rainy day.

I come from a working class background. My dad worked at a steelworks in Stoke-onTrent. He started off as a boltmaker and worked his way up to manager.

My mother did various jobs. She nursed people in a care home, ran an antiques business, and even worked as a taxi driver. I think she never really found out what she wanted to do.

I knew money was tight when I was growing up because my school uniform was second-hand. We didn't go short of food, but there wasn't a lot of money to go around. That was a source of stress for my parents.

They always argued about money. Having grown up with angry parents, I hate arguments and I don't like displays of aggression.

Have you ever struggled to make ends meet?

Yes, when I was in my late teens. I left home at 17 and got my first job working for a computing company, showing people how to use its software. I was suddenly eligible for all these credit and store cards and used them to buy lots of stuff. I felt really flush.

I then realised my repayments were not making any impression on my debts and I didn't earn enough money to make bigger payments.

Eventually, I confessed to my dad I'd run up all this debt. I think it was £1,000 – which was a lot of money in those days. He paid it off as a 21st birthday present.

That was a turning point. Afterwards, I became more careful with money. Nowadays, I pay off my credit cards in full each month.

Have you ever been paid silly money?

Yes. I have done the odd social media advert over the past year.

The most I was paid was £5,000 for about half a day's work.

This was a few weeks after the Handforth parish council meeting went viral. All I had to do was read a script.

Companies and organisations now approach me and say: 'We need someone to talk about this, you'd be ideal.' I tell them I don't know anything about it. 'Yes,' they say, 'but you'd still be ideal'.

How has your viral fame affected you?

Financially, it hasn't made much difference. Most of what I do is either for free or I donate my fee to charity.

I am in a comfortable financial position and live a frugal life. For example, it would never occur to me and my husband to go out to eat, although we do treat ourselves to fish and chips occasionally.

The big difference is that I am a lot busier.

I have met all sorts of interesting people through my podcast and most importantly I have been able to witter on to anyone who will listen about how important town and parish councils are.

I now have 30,000 Twitter followers which I see as an opportunity to reach more people and hopefully encourage them, young and old, to get involved.

What was the best financial year of your life?

It was 2006, the first year I worked full-time. I took a ten-year career break when I had my three children. I think I lost my confidence.

Then I started working part-time for the Cheshire Association of Local Councils which provides training and guidance to town and parish councils in Cheshire.

Back then, we weren't offering a proper training programme and only 50 per cent of councils in Cheshire were members.

I helped to build the organisation until, six years later, it was able to support paying me a full-time wage.

At that point, I started earning a little bit more than my husband. That felt significant.

In charge: Jackie holding the famous Handforth parish council online meeting

The most expensive thing you have bought for fun?

It was an embossed black leather handbag for £585. I bought it five years ago and I still remember how much it cost. I really wanted it at the time, but I haven't used it in a while.

The best money decision you have made?

Taking out a timeshare. My husband and I used to be really bad at taking holidays. If left to our own devices, a whole year could slip by and we'd never quite get round to organising one.

Since we got our timeshare ten years ago, we have been on holiday every year because you have to pay the management fees whether you go or not.

We usually go to Tenerife for three weeks. We like the timeshare resorts – they are good value and it's an easy way to choose where to go on holiday. I'm not good with too much choice.

Do you save into a pension?

Not any more. I used to when I was in my 30s. I then realised that because we were going to inherit a farm in Cheshire from my husband's family, that would become our pension.

We sold the farm and invested the proceeds in the stock market. Since then, neither of us have needed to work, but I wouldn't know what to do with my life if I wasn't working.

Why do you invest in the stock market?

Banks are tight-fisted robbers. I don't appreciate the piddling rates of interest they magnanimously offer savers compared to what they charge borrowers.

Do you own any property?

Yes, a five-bedroom house in rural Shropshire.

We bought it seven years ago for £325,000 and have made lots of improvements, but I have no idea what it's worth now. I don't keep track of that.

If you were Chancellor what would you do?

I would give more funding to parish councils and offer their officers free training. The Government has reduced the funding to principal local authorities while setting the maximum amount they can raise through council tax.

Town and parish councils are picking up the slack for their local communities – funding anything from libraries to swimming pools and adult and children's social care. Yet they still don't get recognised for it.

What is your number one financial priority?

To make sure my children, who are now all in their 30s, are financially secure. I want to be able to leave them an inheritance – the way my parents and my husband's parents left us one.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@British citizens, either born in America or to American parents, have been dealt a blow after a large wealth manager withdrew its services to 'US tax residents'.

Nutmeg, which has more than 140,000 clients, emailed affected customers last month, warning them it was closing their accounts.

The term 'US tax resident' includes people who live in the UK but were born in the US, and those who may never have set foot in the US, but have American parents.

Blow: Nutmeg, which has more than 140,000 clients, emailed affected customers last month, warning them it was closing their accounts

Nutmeg told The Mail on Sunday it was pulling out from providing Isas, pensions and investment accounts to about 350 people due to 'legal and regulatory complexities'.

The US is the only country in the world besides Eritrea that taxes non-resident citizens on their global income.

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), introduced in 2010, requires institutions to report the financial details of all their American clients – or risk being hit with large fines.

Nutmeg was one of the few remaining wealth managers offering accounts to US citizens living in the UK.

In 2018 it stopped accepting US tax residents as new customers, but continued to service existing accounts.

Now, though, it has also pulled the plug on these existing customers. The wealth manager said it was a 'very difficult decision' and was helping clients find an alternative investment provider.

It added that any customers who have renounced their US citizenship should get in touch about keeping their investments with them.

Nutmeg clients have reacted angrily to the news. Daniel Duckett, a pastry chef in Belfast – and a US tax resident – tweeted: 'I've been with Nutmeg for four years and suddenly they decide to stop me being a client.

'Why are banks able to discriminate in this way and get away with it? And what's nuts? The parent company is none other than US-based JPMorgan and [Nutmeg] recently embraced Fatca to attract more expats.'

JPMorgan Chase bought Nutmeg in June as part of its expansion into the UK banking and investment market. In 2016, Nutmeg declared it would accept US citizens living in the UK as clients.

Another customer, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was 'very surprised' to receive the email from Nutmeg.

The woman, who lives in the UK and has British and American nationality, opened a lifetime Isa with Nutmeg in 2017 as part of her retirement plan.

'It seemed the best option for me as I'm self-employed,' she said. 'I liked the fact that the Government put £1,000 in for every £4,000 I put in,' she said.

However, she now feels 'back at square one' and doesn't know how best to save for her retirement. She describes living in the UK with American citizenship as 'a minefield' due to the tax rules.

The US taxes people based on their citizenship rather than residence. Even green card holders, and socalled accidental Americans – those born in the US but who left as babies or toddlers – do not escape the reach of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), America's taxation authority.

Boris Johnson, who was born in New York but left when he was aged five, gave up his American citizenship after the US tried to tax him on the sale of his home in Islington, North London, in 2014 – a move he described at the time as 'absolutely outrageous'.

Those deemed to be US tax resident are liable for tax in America, regardless of where they live, and where the money is earned.

A double tax treaty means people won't be taxed twice, for example if they pay income tax on their earnings here, they won't have to pay a second lot of tax to the IRS.

However, it means that while Isas are tax-free in this country, they will be subject to tax on the other side of the Atlantic.

Alex Straight, a partner at accountant Blick Rothenberg, explained: 'The US won't care that your investments are wrapped up in a stocks and shares Isa.

'It just sees it as an investment account that you hold overseas and will tax you on it. This tax burden creates a real headache for Americans living here.'

According to Straight, investors holding certain funds in their Isas could be subject to punitive amounts of tax: 37 per cent plus interest depending on how long the investment has been held.

A source close to Three said the company was deliberating on whether to bring back the fees. The source said: 'They haven't committed either way at the moment.' Three could not be reached for comment.

Roaming charges were dropped when the UK was part of the EU, meaning customers could use their monthly allowance of calls, data and texts at no extra cost.

Rival O2 said it 'currently has no plans' to change roaming charges across Europe.

The firm said earlier this year that customers travelling to the EU would be charged £3.50 for every gigabyte of data above 25GB.

This McLaren F1 sold at the weekend has set a new record to become the most expensive 1990s car to ever go under the hammer.

The 1995 version of the iconic British supercar - which has covered a mere 242 miles (390km) from new - secured a winning bid of $20,465,000 (£17.4million) in the US at the weekend, making it the priciest model from the 1990s to sell at auction and also the costliest modern-era vehicle to go to the block.

Described as an 'Exceptional time capsule' example of the McLaren F1 road car - of which just 64 were made - and finished in a unique colour combination of Creighton Brown paint and a Light Tan and Brazilian Brown interior, it received a rapturous applause from the sales room at Pebble Beach in California when the hammer eventually dropped following a fraught bidding war between collectors.

The barely-driven McLaren was sold on Saturday by Gooding & Company during its two-day auction during Monterey Car Week.

The winning bid far exceeded the pre-sale estimate, which predicted a figure closer to $15million.

'If there is a single car that best represents the past, present, and future of the automobile, it is the McLaren F1,' says David Brynan, senior specialist at the auction house.

This example is now the most expensive motor from its decade, marginally outpricing a sister car - a 1994 F1 in LM Specification - which was sold by RM Sotheby's also in Monterey for $19,805,000 in 2019.

In terms of more expensive cars that have sold at auction, the next-youngest model is a whopping 28 years older than the McLaren - a 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 S NART Spider sold in 2013.

The driving force behind the F1's astronomical sale price is undoubtedly the low mileage.

With just 242 miles on the clock since 1995, it has averaged just 9.3 miles each year it has been in existence.

It is chassis 029 and, according to factory records, was the 25th F1 built at McLaren's workshop in Woking and the final example built in 1994, having been completed on 23 December.

The 1995 version of the iconic British supercar secured a winning bid of $20,465,000 (£17.4million) at the Gooding & Company Pebble Beach auction in Monterey, California on Saturday

Despite having three owners from new, the car has covered a mere 242 miles (390km) in 26 years. That's an average annual mileage of 9 miles for each year it has been in existence

Its owners have all stored the vehicle in their own displays and treated the British icon meticulously, barely scrubbing in the original tyres it was sold with

The car is particularly notable for its elegant metallic brown livery, which is a unique colour not shared with any other F1 and named after the commercial director for McLaren Cars, Creighton Brown.

Mr Brown, who died in 2006, was one of the British brand's senior representatives along with designer Gordon Murray, race-team boss Ron Dennis, and McLaren shareholder Mansour Ojjeh who, in a famous 1988 Milan Linate airport meeting, made the decision to create an F1 road car project.

Inside, the exterior brown is contrasted with light tan leather and Alcantara, with contrasting Brazilian Brown leather accents and brown carpeting.

It was sold on Saturday with its complementing matching four-piece luggage set, handbook folio, and tool roll were all trimmed in matching light tan leather.

Chassis 029 was delivered new in 1995 to a private Japanese collector who stored it in a static museum display for the next 17 years.

This was so the McLaren could be 'admired for its technical and aesthetic achievements', says Brynan. As a result, it was driven 'sparingly'.

In fact, most of the 242 miles it has accrued in total are believed to have been clocked during promotional filming at a test track near Tsukuba in Japan.

The F1 remained in the hands of its original owner until 2012, when it was sold to Shinji Takei of Tokyo. Just a year later, it was sold again to an American collector whose private garage philosophy is described as 'the best of the best'.

When it arrived in the US in April 2013, the odometer read 196 miles (316km) - meaning it has added just 46 miles in the last eight years.

The car received a rapturous applause from the sales room at Pebble Beach in California on Saturday when the hammer eventually dropped following a fraught bidding war between collectors

The McLaren is like none of the other 64 road cars produced. It is finished in a unique colour combination of Creighton Brown paint and a Light Tan and Brazilian Brown interior

The F1's BMW-developed V12 engine developed a then-staggering 627bhp. It had a claimed top speed of 231mph (372km/h), though with the removal of the rev-limiter could hit 242.96mph (391.01 km/h). In 1993, it obliterated the previous road-car top speed record and held the moniker for a staggering 12 years, when it was eventually dethroned by the Bugatti Veyron in 2005

That's not surprising given the lot description for the vehicle states that it 'has not been driven any distance, nor has it been publicly exhibited' - though the current owner has each month started its 6.1-litre V12 engine and ran it to operating temperature, as well as carrying out fluid changes on a regular basis.

'A credit to the foresight of its three private owners, 029 is presented today in exceptional original condition. In all respects, this is a benchmark, time capsule example of the definitive modern-day supercar,' explained Brynan ahead of the sale.

McLaren F1: Will it fit in my temperature-controlled garage? The McLaren F1 was sold from 1992 for a price of £540,000. The one sold this weekend achieved almost 27 times that amount Production: 64 road cars Price when new: From £540,000 (approx $815,000) Built: Woking, Surrey Doors: 2 Seats: 3 Engine: 6.1-litre 48 valve V-12 petrol developed by BMW Power: 627bhp Acceleration: 0–60mph (97km/h): 3.2 seconds 0–100mph (160km/h): 6.3 seconds 0–200mph (320km/h): 28 seconds Top Speed: With rev limiter on: 231mph (372km/h) With rev limiter removed: 242.96mph (391.01km/h) Record top speed based on average of two runs: 221mph (355km/h) Record duration: Set in 1993, bettered in 2005 by Bugatti Veyron Dimensions: Length: 4,287mm Width: 1,820mm Height: 1,140mm Weight: 1,138kg

'Not only does this McLaren retain its factory-applied paint and interior finishes, its various identification plates and labels also remain intact. Even its Goodyear Eagle tires, specially designed for the F1, are the original ones supplied with the car when new, as confirmed by their 1994 date codes.

'Similarly, the F1 still retains its January 1995-dated Premier fuel cell manufacturer's label and the original McLaren Track Record plaque, with the last line acknowledging the team's 104 Grand Prix wins in 1993,' he added.

The winning bidder also got their hands on its important accessories and spares that were delivered along with the car as new.

That includes a French-made Facom tool chest and leather tool roll, which features gold-plated titanium components. The car's matching-brown integrated storage panniers contain the four-piece fitted luggage set, together with the serial-numbered leather folio which contains the service and warranty book, owner's manual, and flashlight.

The new owner also got their hands on a TAG Heuer 6000 Chronometer wristwatch, deluxe edition of Driving Ambition: The Official Inside Story of the McLaren F1, written by Doug Nye in collaboration with Ron Dennis and Gordon Murray, a car cover and McLaren gloves exclusive to the brand's mechanics.

Between 1994 and 1998, McLaren built just 64 examples of the iconic F1 road car. These remarkable machines have since become among the most sought-after of all classic cars, a model which is on nearly every serious collector's wish list.

One of those cars was owned and famously twice crashed by British actor, Rowan Atkinson.

The Mr Bean star first ploughed the exotic supercar into the back of a Rover Metro on the A6 at Forton, Lancashire, in October 1999.

Then in 2011 he lost control on a slippery bend of the A605 near Peterborough and smashed into a tree.

He escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder, but most of the car was destroyed, with the high-performance 6.1-litre engine reportedly ending up 60 feet away from the chassis.

That second crash ended in what is thought to be Britain's highest ever single car insurance payout, with the vehicle costing £900,000 to be rebuilt by McLaren. It also put up his annual insurance to an estimated £60,000.

Despite almost being written off twice, Atkinson sold his F1 in June 2015 for £8million - a tidy £7.3million profit on the £640,000 he'd paid for it in 1996.

Other famous keepers include the likes of Jay Leno, George Harrison, Ralph Lauren, Nick Mason, Elon Musk and the Sultan of Brunei.

Chassis 029 was delivered new in 1995 to a private Japanese collector who stored it in a static museum display for the next 17 years. This was so the McLaren could be 'admired for its technical and aesthetic achievements', says Gooding & Co expert, David Brynan

Under its original ownership, the F1 was driven 'sparingly'. In fact, most of the 242 miles it has accrued in total are believed to have been clocked during promotional filming at a test track near Tsukuba in Japan

Having been sold to another enthusiast in Japan in 2012, it was again sold in 2013 and shipped to become part of an esteemed US car collector. It was 'driven sparingly' and never displayed at events. Though the keeper did warm the engine every month and meticulously changed its fluids on a regular basis

It was - and still is - the closest thing to a Formula One car for the road with a concept and execution unlike any other production road car and remains the benchmark by which all other super- and hypercars are judged.

Produced by the official McLaren F1 team's operation, it used the finest materials available including aluminuim, titanium, carbon fibre, and even gold.

Ground-breaking features of F1 debuted included a carbon monocoque chassis with a three-seat cockpit with the driver positioned centrally and flanked by a pair of passenger chairs.

The BMW-developed V12 engine developed a then-staggering 627bhp, enough to propel the svelte supercar to 60mph in just 3.2 seconds and to a top speed of 231mph (372km/h) - with the rev-limiter removed, up to 242.96mph (391.01 km/h).

In 1993, it obliterated the previous road-car top speed record and held the moniker for a staggering 12 years, when it was eventually dethroned by the Bugatti Veyron in 2005.

Some 106 McLaren F1s were built in total, though just 64 were road-registered and the rest used for competition, notably taking class wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995, the 1995 BPR Championship, the 1996 Global GT Endurance Championship, and later serving as the foundation for BMW's own successful endurance racing program.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Wet weather, the Delta variant and fraught holiday plans may have made this an August to forget for most of us.

But in corporate Britain, these drizzly days of 2021 will go down in the annals as the Summer of Sell-offs.

Globally, nearly 900 takeovers have been announced in the past 12 months, worth a total of $1.6trillion. In the UK, transactions in the first seven months of 2021 hit a 14- year high by value of $198billion (£142billion), according to research by Refinitiv.

Standing up for business: Directors have a legal duty to promote the success of the business

Deals in Germany and France are running at a fraction of the levels seen here. This is not, as some ministers claim, a thumbs-up for the UK economy by overseas investors. It is because foreign predators can see how easily boards and politicians roll over here.

It is hard to keep up with the firms under siege. Bid battles for supermarket group Morrisons, inhaler maker Vectura and aerospace company Meggitt are making headlines, but the likes of Watchstone, GCP Student Living, Audioboom, Tricorn and Restore have barely registered. This blizzard of bids is a test for boards, for big shareholders and for government.

Decisions taken now will shape corporate Britain for years. How we deal with these takeovers will have a huge impact on society, the defence of the realm and our capability in key sectors.

Will we embrace an extreme version of free-market capitalism, even if it means flogging off much of our defence sector, and even if other countries do no such thing? Is it right for the short-term interests of investors – selling to the highest bidder – to trump the concerns of other stakeholders, such as employees, taxpayers and communities?

Shareholders and boards tout their enthusiasm for ESG, or socially responsible and green investment. But should the concept of ESG be widened to encompass the avoidance of reckless debt, misuse of tax shelters and other chicanery?

These are questions investors and directors should be asking themselves. Instead they seem preoccupied solely with price.

Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman of Meggitt, who has sold a string of businesses, says government will have to intervene if a bidder tries to muscle in without binding commitments on investment and jobs. It is difficult for him to do so, he says, because he has a fiduciary duty to shareholders.

Rudd, who claims he is not in the least bothered by his nickname of 'Sir Sell-off', gave a self-justificatory interview in The Sunday Times yesterday on the topic. Yet in several high-profile contests, including the fight for control of Meggitt and also Vectura and Morrisons, neither suitor is remotely desirable. But they have not been sent packing. Bids have been recommended, only for more generous ones to emerge.

There have been more flip-flops in Britain's boardrooms this summer than on a Brazilian beach. It suggests chairmen have a shaky grasp on the long-term value of their businesses.

Yet it is perfectly possible to reject a bid, as engineering group Senior has done repeatedly – so far. Dame Clara Furse, the former boss of the London Stock Exchange, was besieged but saw off all comers.

Lord Myners, who has said the boards in this country lack 'stomach,' repelled an approach for M&S by Sir Philip Green.

Judi, who has a son, 11, and a 16-year-old daughter, explained in full: 'So, I had her in the bed with me and I must have been in and out of sleep and I woke up and that exhaustion...It was an exhaustion that I've never experienced before in my life.

'I woke up and I remember looking at the cot thinking "a cot? Who's had a baby?" It had clean gone out of my mind that I'd had a baby.

'And then I was like "what is that?"... I was lying on my baby. It was literally for like 10 seconds and I jumped up cause she was kind of moving and I grabbed her.'

Is co-sleeping safe? Advice and tips from The Lullaby Trust Co-sleeping advice Babies should be slept in a clear sleep space, which is easy to create in a cot or Moses basket. We know however that families also bed share, and so recommend making your bed a safer place for baby whether you doze off accidentally, or choose to bed share. Our advice on co-sleeping with your baby will tell you how. For safer co-sleeping: Keep pillows, sheets, blankets away from your baby or any other items that could obstruct your baby’s breathing or cause them to overheat. A high proportion of infants who die as a result of SIDS are found with their head covered by loose bedding. Follow all of our other safer sleep advice to reduce the risk of SIDS such as sleeping baby on their back Avoid letting pets or other children in the bed Make sure baby won’t fall out of bed or get trapped between the mattress and the wall When not to co-sleep It is important for you to know that there are some circumstances in which co-sleeping with your baby can be very dangerous: Either you or your partner smokes (even if you do not smoke in the bedroom) Either you or your partner has drunk alcohol or taken drugs (including medications that may make you drowsy) Your baby was born premature (before 37 weeks) Your baby was born at a low weight (2.5kg or 5½ lbs or less) Never sleep on a sofa or armchair with your baby, this can increase the risk of SIDS by 50 times You should never sleep together with your baby if any of the above points apply to you or your partner.

It comes after it was revealed on Friday that Judi will be joining this year's Strictly Come Dancing line up.

During the announcement on Loose Women show, she said: 'I don't have any moves yet. I'm so nervous it's so out of comfort zone, but what an opportunity to learn a new skill.

'I've known a few weeks. My friends were asking who it was but I couldn't say anything. I'm overwhelmed with excitement.

'I don't know his name but the one with long hair I'd like to be paired with. This is something very new for you I am thrilled.'

'I just remember crying for hours,' Judi admitted as the other panelists gasped at the story which came out while they were debating whether you should leave babies to cry alone

The comedian said in a statement: 'I think I am still in shock that I will be part of this amazing show.

'I’ve watched it for many years and admired the phenomenal abilities of these dancers and celebrities that have taken part and dedicated themselves to learning a new craft.

'I’m truly looking forward to pushing myself in something that I could have only dreamed of doing and now it’s actually coming true! I can’t lie I’m soooo nervous but excited at the same time!'

The holiday comes amid reports that she and Pete have reportedly called it quits on their romance after five months of dating.

The str and comedian, 27, were last seen together in the UK in July, with them putting on a loved-up display at Wimbledon.

However a source has now claimed that the duo have split after trying to make things work long distance 'put a strain' on their relationship.

A source told The Sun: 'Pete and Phoebe's romance was a real whirlwind and from the start they were both totally committed.

'It was pretty telling when Phoebe headed to Croatia with her mates this week rather than going to see Pete in America.

'It was wild while it lasted... But the distance has put a strain on them. They will remain close but unless something drastic changes their relationship won't recover.'

The source continued that both of the stars have very busy schedules at the moment, with Phoebe filming Bridgerton series two in the UK and Pete working on Saturday Night Live in the US as well as filming a movie called Meet Cute.

It is also thought that travel restrictions have added a further pressure to their romance as it isn't easy to just 'jump on a plane' and see each other.

MailOnline has contacted Phoebe and Pete's representatives for further comment.

Phoebe and Pete are thought to have started dating in February, with her taking a trip to NYC the same month, and they confirmed their romance in April.

In exclusive pictures obtained by MailOnline the duo were seen enjoying a stroll in Stoke-on-Trent during his visit to the UK.

It has been previously reported that Pete fell for her after watching her raunchy love scenes on Bridgerton.

The Saturday Night Live star is said to have told pals he thought the actress was 'hot as hell' over her character Daphne's intimate scenes with Simon, The Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page).

A Los Angeles based friend of Pete's told The Mirror: 'Pete just loved Bridgerton and just got totally tripped out by Phoebe.

'She was totally his type - fresh faced, youthful, innocent looking beauty.

'We all joked with him about the naughty scenes, and of course he confessed he found them hot. He binge watched the show and felt it was his destiny to meet her.'

The stars - who are both based in the UK - will not have to quarantine when they come home as Croatia is currently on the green travel list.

Filming on the second series of Bridgerton was recently delayed yet again after a Covid outbreak on set.

The stalling is said to be causing Netflix 'an expensive headache'.

Due to a previous case, shooting had only just resumed again - but a day after cast and crew returned to the period drama things are once again on ice.

The likes of Phoebe and co-star Jonathan Bailey, who plays Viscount Anthony Bridgerton, have had to cease work while various members of the production isolate.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Standing half-way up the staircase, I looked down at my husband, Rob, who was ankle-deep in water in our hallway.

Fearful the rising water could affect the electrics at any moment, I realised it was time to evacuate our children.

It was late June on a Friday night and our home in Solihull, West Midlands, had been flooded by a freak storm. The battle to prevent it zapped all our energy. But our fight was far from over, and no one dared exhale until we knew what our insurer had to say.

Escape: Laura Shannon and daughters Orlagh, left, and Maddie, were forced to flee their home in Solihull after a freak storm sparked flash floods

Every pound of damage needed to be meticulously totted up.

I have no idea exactly how much it will cost to replace each item lost and every square foot of damaged flooring, but we’re looking at a five-figure bill.

And I have learned to my cost (literally) that even with home insurance, you can still end up thousands of pounds out of pocket.

Every year, scores of homeowners are caught out by insurance quirks, often buried in the small print. This was my year to be snared.

I had paid about £300 for home contents and buildings cover with HomeProtect. As a personal finance journalist, I was careful to check the policy for glaring loopholes.

I knew the excess (what we’d have to pay before our insurer stepped in) was a couple of hundred pounds. But, in fact, there was also a separate £2,500 compulsory flooding excess, which, when added to the £250 voluntary excess for the building cover, meant I was down £2,750 before we even started the clean-up.

This figure is perfectly visible on my policy document, but I hadn’t given it a second thought. We don’t live near water, our home is raised above ground level, and it has never flooded before.

Yet floods are becoming increasingly common, with one in six homes in the UK now at risk. Just last month the Government announced a record £5.2 billion investment in flood defences over the next six years. A new flood insurance directory will also be launched this autumn to help more homeowners find cover.

The Met Office says that rainfall exceeding 30mm per hour means flash flooding is likely. At its worst moment, rainfall reached 165 mm per hour over my house. Later, in just one hour, 60 mm cascaded down.

Our daughters, Orlagh, four, and Maddie, one, were asleep upstairs at the time, unaware of their parents’ frantic bid to save the family belongings.

We put every towel we own against doors and moved stores of fresh water and food upstairs in case we became trapped with an infected water supply.

Swamped: The property, which had never flooded before and is not near any rivers, lakes or the sea, and raised above ground level, was left under several feet of water

My husband fought valiantly against a tide — strong enough to carry a tree stump from the back of our garden to our driveway — to rip off the side-gate and alleviate pressure from the swell in our garden.

With cut and bruised legs, he then waded through waist-height water to check on elderly neighbours.

The fire service and police arrived. One neighbour had to be rescued by boat.

We had sprung into action a little before 9pm. By midnight, with my toddler strapped to my back, I was wading out to my parents’ car on higher ground.

It was a surreal moment. Another came soon after, when I fell victim to yet more insurance small print.

The definition of ‘outbuilding’, which in my mind meant the shed, also includes garden fences, driveways and patios, we were told.

This meant the £7,500 of cover we had deemed more than adequate left us under-insured.

As a result, our insurer will only cover about half of any claim for a deck clean or a new shed, leaving us further out of pocket.

The house always wins, it seems. The insurer’s that is.

Our separate flood excess of £2,500 is also deemed very high compared with other policies.

Even homes in flood risk areas covered under the Government’s Flood Re scheme, which aims to make cover affordable, are typically charged an excess of about £250, according to Brian Brown, of data analysts Defaqto.

Yet we were fortunate in some ways as many cheaper insurers do not cover flooding at all.

Others are caught out because they fail to tell their insurers about the flood immediately, and before carrying out repairs. Thankfully I did this.

It’s also important to take photos of damage as it happens. But even having done things right, I almost certainly face a costly renewal premium.

Customers can pay nearly a fifth more for home insurance for living close to water. An average policy is about £193 a year for living within 150 metres of water, according to price comparison website GoCompare. Those more than 400 metres away pay an average £161.

And once a flood has occurred, the average policy can more than double from £132 to £313 a year, Moneysupermarket says.

Roger Flaxman, of insurance disputes specialist Flaxman Partners, adds: ‘We’re going to go through a winter where flooding could become more prolific. Check whether flooding is included or excluded in your policy. If not, you need to buy it.’

The mistake most drivers make is not taking the simple step of shopping around for the best premium. Instead they just accept their insurer's renewal quote, which is likely to be much higher.

The good news is that comparing car insurance is simple and easy and you can find the best price in less than five minutes.

You can then compare the quality of the policy and have a idea of the best price to negotiate with your existing insurer, if you want to stay put.

There are a handful of ways to help reduce your car insurance costs? Whether you are male or female, old or young, follow our ten steps to lower premiums.

How to quickly save on insurance When it comes to car insurance, never simply take your renewal price - shop around instead and with a comparison site that only takes minutes.

Be careful though. When shopping around for car insurance, it's important to make sure that you are comparing like-for-like cover. Some policies may seem cheaper, but you may find you don't have the same level of cover when you have to make a claim.

Use an online comparison service, such as This is Money's partner Compare the Market to do the hard work for you. Put in your details and check the prices that come up. You can alter the excess that you are willing to pay and the mileage you will drive and get new quotes.

Also check the insurers that don't feature in comparison sites, the big two are Direct Line and Aviva. It is also worth checking Admiral separately for its Multicar offers if you are looking to insure more than one vehicle.

If you've been happy with the cover your existing provider has given until now but are unhappy with their renewal quote, let them know the best offer you have received from a rival insurer and ask them to at least match it. Comparing prices is essential to finding this information.

2. Don't put everyone on your policy

Ensure that only regular drivers are named on the policy. You can always add someone for a few days when they really need to drive the car.

3. Protect that no-claims bonus

A long no-claims bonus is the single best way of cutting car insurance costs, so protect it.

This may increase the premium by a few pounds, but this fades into insignificance against the potential loss of a 90 per cent discount on a premium of several hundred pounds.

But the definition of a protected no-claims bonus can vary widely between insurers.

Though accidents caused by another driver will normally have no impact on such a bonus, those caused by the insured could. The key is to always check the policy carefully.

4. Increase your voluntary excess

Agreeing to pay more towards the cost of any accident repairs will bring down premiums. If you are not at fault in an accident, the excess can be recovered. Beware being tempted to allow it to rise too high, however, especially if you have a lower value car.

5. Secure your car

Fitting an approved alarm, immobiliser or tracking device can attract a discount of around 5 per cent. Many newer cars will come with these as standard, so make sure you check if you have them and then declare them.

EXTRA TRICKS TO CUT THE CAR INSURANCE BURDEN Don't forget to haggle! The car insurance market is notoriously competitive. Once you've been on This Is Money's comparison and found your cheapest price (below), get on the phone and start bargaining! Avoid paying monthly charges: D irect debit instalments generally come hand-in-hand with high interest rates. An alternative is to borrow the money on a 0 per cent purchase credit card and then clear it within a year. Think outside the box: An accelerated no-claim s bonus, such as the Bonus Accelerator from Admiral , could give you a year's no claims bonus after just 1 0 months. Named drivers and friends and family: If you have previously been insured as an additional driver on another policy, see if you can transfer a no claims bonus to your own insurance coverage. So me insurers do this, including The AA and Direct Line . Try for a discount by insuring two or more vehicles between friends or family members with the same firm.

No claims discount: It could be worth paying extra to protect yours

6. Do fewer miles

Reduced mileage equates to a greater saving.

For example, a reduction in annual mileage of 5,000 miles could save a typical 35-year-old driver about £50 a year in premiums.

A cut of 10,000 miles a year could save more than £100.

But you must be honest about your annual mileage, as inaccuracy will jeopardise any claim.

Check your use cover - if you don't use your car to drive to work or for business - both things that increase your premium - you may be able to get a cheaper rate.

7. Think carefully about adding young drivers

Adding a young, inexperienced driver to your policy can be a false economy, especially if you have a large or higher powered vehicle.

The premium will still be affected by the youngest driver and he or she may not have a no-claims bonus. Insurers have also been cracking down on fronting, where parents insure cars in their name for children to cut costs, so make sure if you are the policyholder on a car driven by your children that you are actually its main driver, or that you declare otherwise.

8. Watch out for insurance trap cars

If you decide to change your car, check with your insurer if the model will have a significant effect on the premium.

Sporty cars can attract a high premium and often a slightly different model or smaller engine can make a big difference in your favour. It will also probably save you on petrol too!

Be aware that Insurers will try to include administration fees for changes to a policy mid-term. This fee, usually between £25 and £50, will be added if you change a vehicle or your home address.

However, you can ask for the fee to be waived if it is a minor adaptation, such as changing to a personalised registration number.

9. Remember what the garage is for

If your garage is full of junk, clear it out and use it for your car.

Insurers like cars kept in garages overnight and this can dramatically cut your premium.

Aside from the benefit of not having to scrape the ice off in winter, there is a higher risk of theft by keeping the car on the road, so keeping it in the garage will be reflected in your premium.

10. Be a better driver and sign up to a blackbox

Blackbox policies, where the insurer installs a system in your car to monitor your driving, reward those who drive carefully.

Officially called telematics, these check your speed, how aggressive you accelerate and brake and how cautiously you drive, and also whether you are on the road at perceived dangerous times - i.e. the early hours of the morning.

They can cut premiums substantially once you start proving you are a good driver. The biggest win is for those whose premiums are high, especially young drivers.

Some insurers even offer an up front discount if you take out a telematics policy.

Women and cheaper insurance The EU ruled that finance companies can no longer consider your gender when deciding what to charge you. This was triggered by a European Court of Justice ruling on a challenge by a Belgian consumer group. Its case was that the exemption for insurers contradicted the principle of gender equality. The ban came into force on 21 December 2012, after fierce campaign for UK firms which argued that they were not discriminating between the sexes — but instead were basing their prices on statistics. Their argument was that as women live longer they pay less for life insurance, and get cheaper car cover because they have fewer accidents. The move to so-called gender-neutral pricing will affect premiums for all types of insurance — including car, life, private medical and income cover. Despite this, there is still a significant difference between the prices paid by by male and female drivers on average, which is currently almost £100.




@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Advertisement

On the face of things, this 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa looks good value with an asking price of £95,000. But all is not as it seems.

That's because this is the new Testa Rossa J - 'J' standing for Junior - produced by The British Little Car Company and it is a three-quarter scale replica with an electric motor.

It's fully endorsed by the fabled exotic car brand with the rampaging stallion badge and comes with an electric motor with a top speed of 'over' 37mph.

Aimed at teenagers with super-rich parents, it rings in at the same price as a number of used Ferraris from the last 30 years, including barely-used examples of the F355, 360 Modena and 599 GTB.

The £95,000 Ferrari for teenagers: The Italian brand has this week unveiled one of the most expensive toys on the planet - a replica 1957 250 Testa Rossa electric car

This is possibly not the first time you've seen a scale replica electric car for kids from The Little Car Company, as they've collaborated with a number of exotic car makers on supremely-pricey junior models in recent years.

This Ferrari Testa Rossa J is said to be aimed at young drivers over the age of 14.

It has been jointly designed by the Italian manufacturer’s Maranello styling centre in partnership with the British specialist firm using original design drawings held by Ferrari’s Classiche department.

It measures in at 3,100mm long, 1,100mm wide and 700mm tall. That means it's longer than a Smart ForTwo, so you'll definitely need a garage or large shed to keep it (not that anyone who can afford a £95,000 electric toy car doesn't have one of those).

Mini me: The model, built in Bicester, is a three-quarter replica of the real thing, though without the thumping V12 engine

Ferrari has partnered with British junior-model specialists, The Little Car Company, to produce 299 of the like-for-like replicas

The 250 Testa Rossa J is powered by an electric motor and three batteries at the front. They combine to provide 55 miles of driving range

Customers will be able to choose a selection of race liveries or certified Ferrari body colours - as well as a heap of extra features

Out goes the roaring 3.0-litre V12 engine from the genuine race car and in comes an electric motor powered by three batteries located at the front of the car.

Like other junior creations from The Little Car Company, it has different driving modes: Novice, Comfort, Sport and Race.

Even in its most aggressive set-up the maximum speed is restricted to 'over 60kmh, so around 37mph, and driving around 56 miles will empty a fully-charged battery.

The batteries can be recharged via the replica fuel filler car.

Inside, the car gets full leather upholstery and a vintage-style steering wheel produced by Nardi, which is the same supplier for the original 250 Testa Rossa some 64 years ago. The pedal box is from the F8 Tributo supercar

The Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa J has four driving modes - the least powerful setting is 'Novice', which offer a limited top speed of 12mph. Both the 'Sport' and 'Race' settings provide maximum power and a top speed in excess of 37mph

Ferrari says even drivers as young as 14 should be as safe as houses driving one.

'Safety has been a priority throughout the car’s development: the metal side panels were reinforced and an optional roll-bar can be anchored to the chassis,' it said.

Will it fit in my play room? The Little Car Company Ferrari Testa Rossa J Price: from €93,000 before tax (approx £95,000 UK) Production: 299 units built in Bicester, UK Dimensions: Length: 3.1 metres Width: 1.1 metres Height: 700cm Powertrain: Single electric motor, 3x batteries Range: 90km (56 miles) Driving modes and top speed Novice: 20kmh (12mph) Comfort: 45kmh (28mph) Sport: over 60kmh (37mph) Race: over 60 kmh (37mph) Tyres and wheels: 12 inch wheels based on the original Borrani rims (genuine Borrani rims also available at extra cost) and Pirelli Cinturato

'Brembo disc brakes replace the original drum system to maximize braking performance, and these are complemented by a hydraulic handbrake.'

Why is it so expensive, you might ask?

As well as sporting the Ferrari badge and having a hand-beaten alumimium body, it also shares some of its components with the legendary maker's full-size cars.

The pedal box - consisting of a throttle and brake - is the same as that fitted to the F8 Tributo supercar, while the tyres wrapping its 12-inch wheels are supplied by Ferrari's type partner Pirelli.

Suspension is taken care of with Bilstein coilover dampers and custom springs which were fine-tuned and signed off by Ferrari’s test divers at the Fiorano test track.

Like most electric and hybrid cars on the market today, it has regenerative brakes that pump a little energy back into the battery when the car is decellerating.

The cabin also gets full leather upholstering and a classic steering wheel made by Nardi - the same company that supplied the part for the original 1957 model.

There's a vintage instrument cluster redesigned to display EV information, such as remaining driving range and temperatures for the battery and electric motor.

Just 299 examples are due to be produced with customers able to customise their cars, with a choice of 14 historic race liveries and 53 bodywork colours that have graced Ferrari vehicles over the generations.

Prices start from €93,000 before taxes, shipping and optional features are included.

That works out today at around £78,600. With VAT, that's almost £95,000.

It's certainly a lot of money to pay for what is essentially a toy but it's nowhere near as expensive as the real thing.

With just 34 examples built, the 250 TR genuine article will be a prize car in any collection.

The most expensive sold at auction went for £9million in 2011 and £8million in 2009 - the latter of which the Daily Mail had an exclusive drive in. Inflation adjusted, that works out at £11.8million and £11million respectively.

This is the second most expensive genuine Ferrari 250 TR sold at auction. It went under the hammer in 2009 with a winning bid of £8million. Inflation adjusted, that works out at £11million today. (Picture courtesy of RM Sotheby's and Darin Schnabel)

The vintage-style clocks in the toy version have been modified to provide electric vehicle information, such as remaining range and battery temperature

Five used Ferraris you can grab for the same price as the Testa Rossa J

If you chose to spend your £95,000 on a full-size second-hand Ferrari instead, you could get your hands on some impressive motors indeed.

To see which Italian stallions were listed for the same price, This is Money took to used car listings.

A quick scan of Auto Trader showed the same outlay could land you a 2008 599 GTB F1 Fiorano with a six-litre V12 motor under the bonnet that produces 612bhp and has just over 28,000 miles on the clock.

Or how about a 2007 F430 Spider F1? You can grab a V8-powered, 4.3-litre, 193mph open-top beauty for £95,000 with a mere 11,000 miles on the clock.

Which used Ferraris could you pick up for £95,000? How about this 2008 599 GTB F1 Fiorano (left) or how about a 2007 F430 Spider F1 (right) with a mere 11,000 miles on the clock?

Also for a similar price you can travel back three decades in time to pick up a 1988 328 3.2 GTS convertible with just less than 26,000 miles covered in its lifetime.

Our top picks, if given £95,000 to spend on a second-hand Ferrari, would be one of these next two cars.

The first is a one-owner-from-new 360 Modena F1 currently for sale with less than 3,000 miles covered since 2000.

Or, if we wanted to live out our Out Run arcade fantasies from the nineties, a 1998 R-reg F355 Berlinetta GTB with 34,000 miles clocked in 23 years.

Whichever one of these five cars you choose, they will definitely offer more than 37mph flat out.

An outlay of £95k will get you a 1988 328 3.2 GTS convertible with just less than 26,000 miles covered in its lifetime (left). This 1998 R-reg F355 Berlinetta GTB (right) with 34,000 miles clocked in 23 years also costs the same as the new toy replica
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@After slashing payouts as the Covid crisis hit, companies are now bringing back their dividends.

Dividends from UK-listed firms jumped a 51.2 per cent to £25.7bn between March and June, according to the latest UK Dividend Monitor from Link Group.

This beat its expectations but the total payout remains a sixth below its pre-pandemic average levels.

Mining and banking accounted for two-thirds of the increase, according to the report, while the oil sector acted as a brake.

However, oil big guns Shell and BP are keen to lure investors back in with payouts and for those hunting income, the FTSE is making something of a return.

On this episode of the Investing Show Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter discuss which firms and sectors are returning to rewarding investors.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The stock market in the UK has bounced substantially since late March and shares in the US have soared even more, but how long can this last?

On this episode of the Investing Show, Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter look at the rally seen after the coronavirus crash and whether it is warranted or markets have got ahead of themselves?

The FTSE 100 has surged almost 30 per cent since March 23 but remains down 16 per cent on its mid-January peak.

The US index, the S&P 500, has posted even bigger gains - up 43 per cent on its 23 March low - and is almost level with where it started 2020.

Tech firms have led the way in the US, while some of the companies battered by the coronavirus storm have recorded big gains on the hope of revival in the UK.

But tough times remain ahead: job cuts, furlough schemes, plunging profits and higher costs in months to come hang over companies - and there is the potential for wave of bad debt to hit.

So what is the outlook for shares after the post-crash bounce - and will they fall again or is the worst behind us?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Sanford DeLand UK Buffettology Fund was one of only three UK All Companies funds to last year up.

Even then, manager Keith Ashworth-Lord admits that this was only by a marginal amount, at 0.4 per cent and largely down to acting swiftly to ditch some underperforming companies earlier in the year and then making a few smart buys when the market fell at the end of 2018.

Nonetheless, in a tough year for investors the manager's strategy of investing along the lines of Warren Buffett's philosophy paid off and the Buffettology fund made savers money rather than losing it, as most other UK funds did.

Over the past five years the SDL UK Buffettology fund (blue) has greatly outstripped the average UK All Companies fund (red)

While its ongoing charges are a relatively high 1.23 per cent, long-term performance has been impressive.

The UK Buffettology fund follows the investing principles of famous investor Warren Buffett

Over five years the Buffettology fund is the top performer in its sector with a 92.4 per cent gain, according to FE Trustnet figures, and since the start of 2019 it has built on that with a 5.4 per cent rise.

So, what did Keith learn from 2018's turbulent year for investors?

In this Investing Show interview he talks through both the winners and the losers with This is Money's Simon Lambert.

Keith also explains why he bought into some companies to the tune of more than £36.7million when shares were on sale late last year - and how he aims to invest like Buffett in the UK.

The fund holds just 30 different shares making it a high conviction portfolio and Keith says that he looks to buy companies that have a strong competitive advantage over rivals, Buffett's famous moat, and uses a business perspective investing strategy.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's biggest wind turbine factory in Hull will double in size following a £186million upgrade.

The investment by Siemens in Alexandra Dock, Hull, means the facility can make next-generation turbines, as well as blades more than 330 feet long.

These will be used in huge wind farms currently under construction in the North Sea and at other sites abroad.

The Alexander Dock factory in Hull is to build next generation turbines for windfarms currently being built in the North Sea (pictured) after owner Siemens announced a £186m upgrade

It is a major boost to the UK's green power industry and will create about 200 jobs, while supporting a further 1,000 existing roles.

Manufacturer GRI Renewable Industries yesterday also announced plans for a £78million wind turbine tower factory in Hull, taking the total of new investments to £264million. GRI's factory is expected to create another 260 jobs.

The companies are both set to receive grant funding from a £160million Government pot to support offshore wind, although details of how much each will get have yet to be finalised.

The deals come as Government is driving a nationwide push to transition to greener sources of energy and make Britain a world leader in the field. It is hoped they will also support the Government's levelling up agenda.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said yesterday's announcement was part of the UK's 'green industrial revolution'.

Alexandra Dock is already the UK's biggest wind turbine factory and opened in 2016.

Under the plans, the factory will more than double in size, from almost 120,000 sq ft to nearly 260,000 sq ft.

Construction work for its Hull factory's expansion is expected to begin within weeks and finish in 2023.

Last month SeAH Wind and Smulders Projects UK announced separate investments in Hull and Newcastle, respectively.

SeAH will build a £117million factory to build foundations known as 'monopiles' for wind turbines, while Smulders has announced a £70million upgrade of their site that makes 'transition' pieces for foundations.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Life is tough for first-time buyers. House prices were already expensive before the coronavirus lockdowns and defying all logic a mini-boom has sent the average house price up £20,000 further over the past year.

At the same time mortgage lenders have indulged in a flight to safety, canning the vast majority of 95 per cent loan-to-value mortgages and bumping up the gap between rates on 90 per cent mortgages and those for borrowers with more equity.

Once more into the breach has stepped the Government, with taxpayer aid for banks and building societies to offer more 5 per cent deposit mortgages.

But is this a wise move? Should we stop meddling in the mortgage and property market, as short-term assistance ends up meaning long-term pain as more credit is extended and house prices climb ever higher?

And could it be that while the 95 per cent mortgage push is the wrong move at the national economic level, on a personal level taking one might prove a good move for some, who could end up paying less than they do in rent.

On this week's podcast, Georgie Frost, Lee Boyce and Simon Lambert discuss the 95 per cent mortgages, the rise in house prices and whether buy-to-let is still a good investment.

Also this week, the lowdown on the Barclaycard customer service meltdown as long-standing customers see their credit limits slashed.

And finally, you want a shed-office (aka a shoffice) to work in down the bottom of the garden, but can you power it with solar panels?

Is giving first-time buyers help to get more 95% mortgages a wise move or could it just make things worse in the long run?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I had a small personal pension valued at £20,000. I withdrew it in total earlier in the year as I needed it to pay bills during Covid-19.

I paid 20 per cent tax on £15,000 and £5,000 was tax free.

I now realise I have triggered the money purchase annual allowance, giving me only a £4,000 tax free pension allowance a year going forward.

Retirement finances: I took a £20k pension and accidentally triggered a tax limit on future savings - will this stop me putting money in my new job's scheme?

I have now got a government job with a defined benefit pension scheme where contributions will be more than £4,000.

Does the MPAA still apply as this new pension is a defined benefit pension and not a defined contribution one? Where do I stand?

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Steve Webb replies: Your question provides a timely reminder to anyone considering using their pension to tide them over in these difficult times that they need to think carefully about the implications of any decision they make now to access a pension pot.

For most people, the standard annual limit on pension contributions which can benefit from tax relief (known as the annual allowance) is £40,000.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

For those with the highest earnings this limit is reduced on a sliding scale. You can read more about the ‘tapered annual allowance’ here.

Your issue is slightly different.

When the Government introduced ‘pension freedoms’ in 2015 it made it much easier to get your money out of your pension.

Once you were 55 or over you could access your entire pension if you wished, taking a quarter tax free and paying tax on the rest.

One problem which the government foresaw was that people might try to abuse this new freedom.

There was a risk that people could empty out their pension pot, benefit from tax free cash and then put the whole lot back in again, topped up by tax relief.

This could then be accessed for a second time, with another 25 per cent being tax free and so on.

To try to prevent this from happening, the Government created a new limit on annual contributions which can benefit from tax relief.

This is called the money purchase annual allowance (MPAA).

If you access a chunk of cash from a defined contribution or ‘pot of money’ type pension, and if you take out more than the 25 per cent tax free lump sum, you are then subject to a much lower annual allowance.

What are defined contribution and defined benefit pensions? Defined contribution pensions take contributions from both employer and employee and invest them to provide a pot of money at retirement. Unless you work in the public sector, they have now mostly replaced more generous gold-plated defined benefit - or final salary - pensions, which provide a guaranteed income after retirement until you die.

The MPAA is currently just £4,000 per year. Note that the MPAA is not normally triggered when you cash in a small pension pot worth less than £10,000 - but you should check beforehand if you plan to do this - nor if you use everything except the tax-free lump sum to buy an annuity.

You have asked whether this is going to be a problem in your new job which has an old-style ‘defined benefit’ or salary-related pension and where the annual contributions are going to be more than £4,000 per year.

The good news is that this £4,000 limit only applies to future contributions into ‘pot of money’ type pensions and not final salary pensions.

This is explained in more detail on the website of the Money Advice Service here.

Although the MPAA is not going to be a problem for you personally, most people who start saving again into a pension will not be joining a final salary pension.

The majority of workers in the private sector can only save into a ‘pot of money’ type pension and in this case the MPAA of £4,000 would apply.

The moral of this story for anyone thinking of accessing their pension is to be aware of the risk that they may be severely restricting their ability to build up further pension savings in the future.

If they can find other ways to tide them over (for example, perhaps accessing money saved in an Isa) this might be a better option.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Augmentum Fintech listed on the stock market in March 2018, chief executive and founder Tim Levene found it hard to persuade big City institutions to back the business.

The idea, Levene explained back then, was to build a company that invested in fast-growing financial technology firms and reap the rewards as these acorns developed into oaks. The flotation eventually got away, raising £90million – less than Levene had hoped for – at £1 a share.

Midas recommended the stock from the start and investors who subscribed to the flotation are glad that they did. The shares have risen to £1.40 and the business has grown rapidly.

New wave: Augmentum, led by Tim Levene, invests in fintech firms such as Tide

In 2018, there were just five businesses in Augmentum's portfolio – including online share service Interactive Investor, precious metals specialist Bullion Vault and Seedrs, the crowdfunding group.

Today, Augmentum has investments in 22 businesses, from digital wills and funeral firm Farewill to SME challenger bank Tide to alternative mortgage provider Habito.

Augmentum's businesses are making strong progress. Annual results to March 31 this year showed that the portfolio is now valued at more than £180million, up from £136million in 2020. Looking ahead, Levene expects to make at least one exit every year, selling individual investments and either reinvesting the cash or returning some to shareholders.

At the same time, the group is on the lookout for new deals and has amassed a rich potential pipeline collectively valued at about £200million.

Most of these transactions will fall by the wayside but Levene believes the time is right to pick up some attractive businesses and he is looking to shareholders to help finance his plans.

Augmentum launched a fundraising on June 17, offering new and existing investors shares at £1.35½, a discount to the current price.

The offer is open until July 8 and the firm hopes to raise at least £40million to buy new businesses.

Levene, a 2.5 per cent shareholder, intends to participate in the deal.

Midas verdict: Financial technology is a specialist field, but it is growing fast and the pace of change is likely only to increase over the coming years.

Augmentum Fintech allows individual investors to access the sector, and the broad sweep of businesses in its portfolio means that the group is not reliant on any one type of firm or technology.

Existing shareholders have seen a 40 per cent rise in their shares. At £1.40, they should stick with the business. For new investors, the current fund raising provides a good opportunity to acquire stock at a discount.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When the UK first went into lockdown, commercial property companies were among the first to feel the effect.

Investors worried that tenants would be unable to pay the rent, businesses would go bankrupt and valuations would sink.

These things happened – but not as much as everyone feared. While some firms have suffered from low rental payments, high vacancies and tumbling valuations, others have flourished and their shares have soared.

There are also a number of firms whose resilience is yet to be reflected in their share price, offering an attractive opportunity to snap up stocks on the cheap, with generous dividends thrown in.

Growing fast: Warehouse Reit lets sites to firms such as Amazon as well as local businesses

Warehouse Reit

While most property companies have been shunned through the pandemic, Warehouse Reit has been one of the lucky ones and its shares have soared.

Midas recommended the stock in 2018 when the price was 96.5p. The shares have risen 58 per cent to £1.52 and should continue to gain ground.

Warehouse owns industrial sites close to city centres and let to companies ranging from Amazon to local businesses.

The majority are involved in ecommerce and have flourished over the past year. Rent collection has been strong, the value of Warehouse's portfolio has risen and the group has even raised money on the stock market to buy more assets.

Midas verdict: Warehouse Reit has grown materially through the pandemic and should continue in that vein. Industrial parks are in demand, rents are rising and supply is limited. At £1.52, the shares have further to run – and shareholders benefit from a 6.2p dividend too.

Ediston Property Investment Company

Ediston Property Investment Company, known as EPIC, has had a very different time over the past year, but the shares now look like a bargain.

Midas recommended the stock in June 2018, when the price was £1.11. By March of last year, it had plummeted to 45p and big investors were clamouring to know how EPIC boss Calum Bruce was going to persuade tenants to pay the rent.

Two-thirds of the company's properties are retail parks, while most of the rest are office blocks.

Many market watchers considered that a pretty disastrous combination, but they have been proved wrong.

The group collected 92 per cent of rent owed from last March to this, the figure rose to 95 per cent in the six months to this March and is likely to be even higher when Epic reports quarterly figures next month.

Epic has benefited from several clever management choices. First, edge-of-town retail parks have fared far better through the pandemic than the high street.

Second, Epic's tenants include high-performing businesses such as B&M, B&Q and Pets at Home. And third, the company focuses on areas outside the SouthEast, including Scotland, Wales and the Midlands.

The firm also set up a special team when the pandemic erupted, which talked directly to tenants and worked on plans to keep both sides happy.

Today, discussions with tenants are less about paying their dues and more about taking on new space or extending leases. Later this week, the group opens a new retail park in Haddington, East Lothian, already pre-let to stores including Aldi, Iceland and Costa. Further expansion is in Bruce's sights so new deals are likely in the coming months.

Epic pays a monthly dividend, recently increased by 25 per cent to 0.417p, equating to 5p for the year. Further substantial increases are expected as the recovery continues.

Midas verdict: Epic shares are 69p, up from their lows last year but still at a 19 per cent discount to the value of the firm's assets. Existing shareholders have had a rough ride but they can take comfort in the group's 7.3 per cent dividend yield. New investors could also grab a few shares, as the current price does not reflect Epic's prospects.

Palace Capital

Palace Capital has also been poorly treated since Covid-19 hit Britain. The shares almost halved to £1.71 when lockdowns were imposed last year and even though they have recovered to £2.60 since then, they are still well below pre-pandemic levels – and below the £3.12 price at which Midas recommended them in 2014.

The decline seems unwarranted and should reverse over the coming months and beyond.

Palace is run by two of the most experienced hands in the market, 83-year-old Stanley Davis and 78- year-old Neil Sinclair. The duo have long understood the value of talking to tenants and, like Epic, this has stood them in good stead over the past 15 months.

Palace collected 95 per cent of rents owed in the year to March 2021 and raised its final dividend by 20 per cent to 3p, saying that shareholders would receive at least 12p in the current financial year.

This reflects confidence in the future. Palace has built a portfolio of properties in cities such as York, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle and Liverpool. Vacant space is being let, demand is brisk and sales are proceeding as planned.

Midas verdict: Palace Capital's portfolio is valued at £3.43 a share, so the stock is trading at a 24 per cent discount to the value of the group's assets. Yet the business is making progress, pays attractive dividends and should be a prime beneficiary of the Government's levelling up agenda. At £2.60, the shares are a buy. Existing investors should also keep the faith.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There is no doubt that the 2017 launch of investment fund Blue Whale Growth has proved an unequivocal success.

In the past few days, the fund's share price has broken through the £2 mark – double its £1 launch price nearly four years ago. For billionaire Peter Hargreaves, co-founder of investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, the fund has yet again demonstrated his shrewd business sense – and ability to build winning companies.

Together with fund manager Stephen Yiu, Hargreaves set up investment business Blue Whale Capital in 2017. The global fund, Blue Whale Growth, followed shortly afterwards with Hargreaves investing £25million of his own money at launch.

Ever since, Hargreaves and his family have been investing more of their money in the fund. The result is that today, their holding in the £850million fund is worth £200million-plus, and Hargreaves has no intention of taking profits.

In a buoyant note published last week, he confirmed that his family were 'still adding to their holdings' and proclaimed that the six-strong investment team, led by Yiu, had the hunger 'to keep in the forefront of performance'.

The fund's performance has been consistently excellent with returns in calendar years 2019 and 2020 being 27 and 26 per cent respectively So far this year, the fund has generated a return of ten per cent.

Yiu, who learnt his trade as a fund manager at Artemis, New Star and hedge fund Nevsky Capital (as well as Hargreaves Lansdown), remains incredibly humble about the fund's success.

'You would think you can't keep making 20 per cent a year,' he says. 'Maybe 15 per cent per annum over the medium term, but not 20 per cent.'

He is also mindful of the threat that inflation poses for equity markets. 'Inflation is a worry,' he says. 'If it moves towards four or five per cent, here or in the US, that will present some headwinds for equity markets – and it could lead to a correction. But it's not part of our current thesis.'

The fund only has a small cash position, representing a tad over two per cent of the portfolio, and Yiu says there is no intention to raise this 'at the moment'.

Some of the fund's 29 holdings, Yiu adds, have sufficient dominance in their markets to counter any uptick in inflation by raising prices – the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. Companies such as Visa and Mastercard – both top ten holdings – would also not be adversely impacted as they would earn more fees on higher transaction values.

Although some 70 per cent of the fund is invested in companies listed in the US, Yiu is keen to point out that these companies earn their revenues globally. They also generate their profits across a broader range of business sectors than their stock market categorisation would suggest.

So, while 54 per cent of the fund's portfolio is classified as 'technology,' only a fifth of the holdings' revenues are generated from technology business.

Yiu has not made any drastic changes to the fund's portfolio. Five of the top ten holdings – Adobe, Alphabet, Facebook, Mastercard and Microsoft – were first bought in the early stages of the fund's life. Disposals this year include stakes in Unilever – 'we saw better opportunities elsewhere' – and medical device supplier Boston Scientific – 'a couple of hiccups over product launches'.

Yiu says Blue Whale Capital will remain focused on managing global portfolios. A new investment trust is a possibility although 'we are not ready yet'.

Blue Whale Growth has annual charges of 0.87 per cent, pays minimal income, and its stock market ID code is BD6PG78.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BMO Commercial Property Trust has experienced a gruelling 15 months. It invests in prime UK property and specialises in three of the sectors hardest hit by national lockdowns: office, retail and leisure space.

As a result, an investment of £100 in the fund at the beginning of last year would be worth just £75 today.

However, as shops, restaurants and offices open up again, the share price has started to rise steeply.

It has already increased by 14 per cent since the beginning of this year, but still has some way to go before it hits levels seen before the pandemic.

Fund manager Richard Kirby believes the depressed share price presents an interesting opportunity for investors. 'It's been a very challenging year with the pandemic and lockdown,' he says.

'Although we're hopefully coming out of it now, our shares are still trading at a discount, which looks very attractive.'

Shares are currently trading at 82p, which is a 31p discount on the value of the fund's underlying assets. The fund also has an attractive dividend yield of just over five per cent. It contains over 30 properties, the majority of which are located in London and the South East.

Some have already bounced back. BMO Commercial Property Trust's biggest holding is St Christopher's Place, a small, stylish shopping and leisure district in London's West End.

During the national lockdowns, the area's biggest strengths became its weaknesses, but thankfully this trend is quickly reversing once again.

'All of the positives of St Christopher's Place turned negative in the pandemic,' says Kirby. 'It's heavily exposed to the hospitality, food and beverage and retail sectors. Plus, it's in Central London and relies on office workers, tourism and public transport.

'But, it has enjoyed a successful reopening – it's been very hard to book a table in the capital in recent weeks. With more businesses reopening, we're hopeful it will be able to capitalise and stabilise.'

A lot rests on its success: St Christopher's Place makes up more than 20 per cent of the value of the fund.

BMO Commercial Property Trust's out-of-town retail holdings are also picking up. Locations with plentiful, free parking in particular are proving attractive. Kirby adds: 'We've seen continued growth in online sales – especially in fashion. But I think people are fed up with ordering online and then having to return merchandise that doesn't fit or is different to how it looked online.'

Office spaces could take longer to recover. Kirby thinks there will still be strong demand for them in future – although he admits that he and his team are still successfully working from home, as they have for over a year.

Expectations of office space are changing, however, and the fund is working with the tenants of its properties to adapt. For example, it is working on monitoring air quality in its buildings.

'The issue of wellbeing has really moved up the agenda,' says Kirby. 'People also value quality, flexible space, with good local amenities.'

The composition of the fund has hardly changed in the last couple of years.

But as we emerge from the pandemic, Kirby plans to make some changes to benefit from new trends, considering sales of retail properties to reinvest in other sectors.

Top of the list for purchases will be warehouses, which are benefiting from the online shopping boom. Student accommodation could also be on the list.

BMO Commercial Property Trust features on wealth platform Interactive Investor's Super 60 best-buy fund list.

Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research, says: 'With rent collections continuing to improve, the portfolio is well positioned to begin its recovery once Covid restrictions are lifted.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I've had a problem with a home I bought in the past, and wanted to know how long you have to make a claim when a mistake has been made by a solicitor.

In my instance it dates back to a property I purchased in 1988. An extension had been built by the previous owner.

Although they got planning permission, there was a covenant in place that meant they should also have got permission from the landowners - a local family estate - before any work could be done.

This reader's dispute dates back to 1988: the year when Who Framed Roger Rabbit was one of the highest-grossing films and Kylie Minogue's debut album topped the charts. Can he still resolve it now?

My solicitor in 1988 didn't pick this up, so I was unaware of the issue until I came to sell the property in 1999, when the covenant was picked up by the buyer's solicitor.

This resulted in me having to disclose the extension to the landowner, and paying a fee and costs of around £4,000 in order to sell the home.

The solicitor I used for the sale of that property started proceedings against my original solicitor on my behalf.

The original solicitor disputed it instead of passing it on to their insurers. The solicitor I was using then went out of business, and owing to my personal situation - I was going through a divorce at the time - it never got pursued.

Is it far past time for me to attempt another claim against the original solicitor involved in the purchase? Is there anything else I can do? E.B, via email

Helen Crane, This is Money, replies: You contacted me after I wrote this article about the pandemic housing boom potentially causing a surge in costly legal errors, as conveyancers worked flat-out to help their clients meet the stamp duty holiday deadline.

Having read about the potential for professional negligence claims to be brought against conveyancers if their mistakes resulted in the homeowner losing money, you wondered whether this might still apply to you.

It has been a long time since you bought the home in question – in this case more than three decades.

However, you only discovered the mistake that had been made 11 years later.

At the time, you accepted the £4,000 fee for getting retrospective permission from the landowner, even though it had been the previous owners of the home who had built the offending extension.

An extension built without the proper permission cost this reader £4,000 in fees

This was because you did not want to disrupt the sale or put off the buyer that you had already found.

You did start legal proceedings afterwards, but after your solicitor went out of business, life got in the way and the claim was never pursued.

Now, you are wondering whether there is still any chance of some recourse.

I asked Naomi Findlay and Stephanie Reeves, solicitors at law firm Irwin Mitchell, to explain the claims process for professional negligence and how long complainants have to do this.

They said: English law sets out certain time limits for bringing civil claims. These time limits are set out in the Limitation Act 1980.

For claims involving negligence, the general rule is that the claim must be issued at court within six years from the date of the negligence.

The date of the negligence in this context is likely to be the date on which you exchanged contracts to purchase the property in 1988, which was the last opportunity for your original solicitor to advise you in relation to the covenant.

This would mean that, if your original solicitor negligently failed to advise you in relation to the covenant on the property in 1988, you would need to have issued a claim against your original solicitor by 1994.

There are, however, some exceptions to the general rule.

For example, the limitation period may be extended where the claimant only became aware of certain facts relevant to the negligence at a later date.

In such cases, the limitation period is the later of either (i) six years from the date of the negligence; or (ii) three years from the date the claimant knew or ought to have known about the negligence.

This exception is subject to a 15 year longstop date. This means that a claim cannot be pursued more than 15 years from the date of the negligence, even if the claimant only becomes aware of the negligence after that period.

Applying the above exception, on the basis that you became aware of your original solicitor's negligence in 1999 when you sold the property, you would need to have issued a claim against your original solicitor by 2002.

Even if this were not the case, the 15-year longstop would operate here to statute-bar your claim now in any event.

The maximum time limit for making a legal claim against a solicitor, for example if they have missed something important in a contract, is 15 years

It is important to note that, whilst the Limitation Act 1980 imposes deadlines on when a claim may be issued at court, it does not prevent parties from engaging in correspondence about the dispute.

As such, it may still be possible for you to write to your original solicitor with a view obtaining reimbursement for your losses.

Your original solicitor is very likely, however, to rely on the provisions of the Limitation Act 1980 in order to avoid payment.

The applicable limitation period in claims such as this always depend on their particular facts.

We recommend that all readers seek independent legal advice before seeking to pursue a claim.

Helen Crane, This is Money, replies: Unfortunately it does not look likely that you will be able to claim back the fee in this case.

Under the law, the maximum amount of time you would have had to make a claim would be 15 years, and that deadline is long since past.

While you could try contacting the solicitor you used back in 1988 to ask for redress outside of the courts, they are likely to refuse payment on the basis that no legal action can now be taken.

However, perhaps you will take some heart from the fact that yours may serve as a cautionary tale for today's home buyers, who might notice conveyancing mistakes over the next few years.

They must take action either less than six years after the negligence had occurred, or less than three years since they became aware of the negligence.

And if they did not notice the negligence straight away, they are still limited to 15 years after the negligence to make a claim, regardless of when they noticed it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@My wife and I have lived at our current address for more than 20 years. The house name is written on the front gate.

Nonetheless, post addressed correctly has regularly been returned to financial services firms, causing us no end of problems.

Most recently, one of my bank statements went back to Santander. The bank stopped sending me bank or credit card statements and made no attempt, using my telephone number or email address, to establish whether I was still alive or if I had moved.

Post addressed correctly to a reader has regularly been returned to financial services firms

The Financial Ombudsman Service told me Santander offered to settle my complaint but the bank has done nothing to rectify matters.

In fact, its credit card arm has put a block on my card and is imposing a penalty charge and interest on a transaction I did not know had taken place (an annual subscription to New Scientist) because I have not been receiving statements.

D. S., Woking, Surrey.

Tony Hazel replies: I don't usually publish letters about cases where the Financial Ombudsman Service has become involved, but I am making an exception here because you've highlighted an important issue.

You told me: 'It really beggars belief that when banks get post returned they simply shrug their shoulders and make no effort at all to establish if their customer has really moved away or even if they are still alive.'

Santander says that 'to protect customer data, we place a mail block on an account linked to any mail that gets returned'.

But wait a minute! What's the point of banks and other financial organisations collecting our phone numbers and emails if they make no attempt to contact us before cancelling our post?

Recently I covered a case where a private pension had been halted for the same reason.

Santander has now refunded interest and charges, reinstated your credit card and set you up to receive statements digitally via online banking. It has also provided details on how to pay your credit card by direct debit.

But it, and other financial organisations, need protocols which lead to a secondary contact method being used before customers are 'cancelled'.

People working from home due to coronavirus are entitled to claim tax relief through HMRC

Tax relief trouble

I have been working from home since March 23 last year. My HR director said I could apply for tax relief on household costs such as heating.

I have failed umpteen times to claim online, and wrote to the tax office in East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire on January 12 and again on February 4.

I have still not received a response.

S. M., by email.

Tony Hazel replies: Those told by their employer to work from home — rather than choosing to do so — because of coronavirus and, as a result, have seen their household costs increase are entitled to claim tax relief.

You can do this through HMRC's online portal via a Government Gateway account. You can claim tax relief of up to £6 a week without having to provide evidence.

In real terms, this is worth £1.20 a week to a basic-rate taxpayer and £2.40 to a higher-rate taxpayer. If you want to claim more than £6 per week you need to provide evidence.

HMRC will accept backdated claims for up to four years. Go to: gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees/working-at-home.

The taxman says your problem stemmed from the ID checks. You use a different first name to the one HMRC has registered for you. There is a link at the bottom of the identity verification page to click for support.

An HMRC spokesman says: 'Before sharing any personal data with a customer online we have a duty to establish their identity to a high degree of confidence, but we want services to be as straightforward as possible while doing it.

'That's why anyone who is unable to prove their identity online can contact us via alternate channels.' You have now received your tax rebate of £108.02.

No reply from Sun Life

My husband died in April. I am having trouble claiming on some Sun Life insurance policies. I am nearly 80 and not very computer literate.

There are three policies involved but I do not have any information as to where I should apply for the proceeds.

I have written to three addresses but have received no replies and one letter was returned unopened.

The £9,000 from these policies was meant to cover my husband's funeral and I had to sell premium bonds to pay for it instead.

S. B., Filey, N. Yorks.

Tony Hazel replies: Sun Life and I send our condolences after the death of your husband.

It seems you wrote to old addresses. But if that's all the information you hold then what are you supposed to do?

The insurance industry has been through merger after merger over the past two decades. I feel far greater efforts need to be made to help those in your situation, especially older clients who may not be au fait with the internet.

Sun Life has paid two of the policies now, plus interest. The third was transferred to Friends Life, which is now part of Aviva.

Sun Life says it wrote to customers to give them the contact details needed to make a claim. It has now supplied you with that information and Aviva has paid out the policy.

The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has an online list of mergers (abi.org.uk), but those who are not internet savvy could phone ABI on 020 7600 3333.

We love hearing from our loyal readers, so ask that during this challenging time you write to us by email where possible, as we will not pick up letters sent to our postal address as regularly as usual. You can write to: asktony@ dailymail.co.uk or, if you prefer, Ask Tony, Money Mail, Northcliffe House, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT — please include your daytime phone number, postal address and a separate note addressed to the offending organisation giving them permission to talk to Tony Hazell.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The John Lewis Partnership has announced it will create another 500 jobs to help fulfil the increasing growth in digital sales to its customers.

It has agreed a deal with Tesco to lease a one million square foot distribution centre at Fenny Lock in Milton Keynes for 11 years, from which it plans to start operating in two years' time.

Located just four miles from its largest warehouse in Magna Park, which is double the size, the site will stock fashion, small home furnishing and technology items.

The news follows the company declaring around 4,000 job cuts in the face of the coronavirus downturn, including 1,000 jobs last month as part of a shake-up of its store management, as it shuts several stores and cancelled its famous bonus.

Job creation: The John Lewis Partnership will create another 500 jobs at a new warehouse

John Lewis has also confirmed another deal to lease a 300,000 sq ft logistics site in the Leicestershire village of Bardon, which will be operated by Clipper Logistics and be operational in time for the Black Friday shopping holiday later this year.

When the two become operational, it will mean the Waitrose owner has a total of 12 distribution centres across England, with half of them located in Milton Keynes and the remainder situated throughout the Midlands.

Andrew Murphy, the executive director of operations at the retailer, said the new Milton Keynes site 'represents a fantastic opportunity to power the continued growth of Johnlewis.com, ensuring that we can keep pace with customer demand - both for our products and for our wide range of fulfilment and delivery options.'

He added that the site's closeness to its Magna Park location would help it cut the number of packages it creates by one million per year, reduce lorry usage, and bring it closer to hitting its target of reaching net zero carbon by 2035.

The group intends to invest £50million this year in its website, app, and virtual events and services and £100million in total over five years towards its online platform.

Store closures have meant online orders at John Lewis have expanded from 40 per cent to more than 60 per cent since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Pandemic boost: In comparison to John Lewis's department store chain, its Waitrose division accelerated to record levels last year thanks to a surge in grocery sales

But this has come nowhere to making up for the massive loss in store purchases and high losses, including a £517million annual loss last year, the first yearly loss in its history.

British department store chains have been some of the worst casualties since the pandemic began. Debenhams fell into administration before being forced to closed all its remaining outlets.

By contrast, profits at Waitrose accelerated to record levels last year thanks to a surge in grocery sales and the decision by the supermarket not to hand back £85million in business rates relief and pay a bonus to staff.

To try and recover trade, John Lewis has launched an 'affordable' range called Anyday, which aims to attract a younger demographic, such as university freshers, first-time home buyers and renters.

It additionally introduced its first ever 'buy now, pay later' offer in response to the rise in interest free credit. Chairman Sharon White has said the partnership aims to have 40 per cent of its earnings derive from 'non-retail' by the end of the decade.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The mortgage battle led rates to continue their downward slide this week, with multiple deals now available at less than 0.9 per cent interest.

Halifax launched the lowest two-year fixed rate ever seen at just 0.83 per cent on Monday, and now HSBC has responded with the lowest rate in its own history at 0.89 per cent.

The two-year fixed rate incurs a £999 arrangement fee and, as with most of the ultra-low interest deals currently on the market, is only available to home movers or those remortgaging with at least a 40 per cent deposit or equity.

This has led to questions over how much further rates can fall. Brokers are divided on the answer, with some suggesting they could go to 0.5 per cent and others saying they won't go much lower. We take a look at the market and speak to the experts.

Bottoming out? Mortgage rates are hitting historic lows of less than 0.90 per cent

Two-year deals are the lowest rate battleground, with those 0.83 per cent and 0.89 per cent deals on offer, but many borrowers are increasingly attracted by the idea of fixing for five years.

HSBC also launched a sub-1 per cent deal on a five-year fixed rate for such borrowers, at 0.99 per cent with a £999 fee.

With rates so low, those coming to the end of a fixed-rate term should be able to secure a competitive deal, provided they have a substantial deposit and a good credit rating.

Brokers say that, in some circumstances, it may even be worth customers exiting a fixed-term mortgage early and paying the early repayment penalty in order to snap up a super-low rate.

But the lowest rates don't always represent the best deal, as they often come with hefty arrangement fees.

This is Money explains what borrowers need to know about rates across the market right now, and what to check if they are considering a mortgage switch.

Why are rates so low?

Banks and building societies are awash with cash to lend, as middle-class savers paid in huge amounts during the pandemic when they couldn't spend on going out or holidays. Most savers are earning pitiful interest on it, generating a cheap funding opportunity for lenders.

Lenders are also competing with each other for new customers, as they shrug off fears of house price falls and instead chase the boom in purchases seen during the pandemic. Some are keen to grab business now for fear appetite for borrowing may fall away after the stamp duty holiday was tapered down at the end of June.

'This is being exacerbated by the transaction cliff-edge at the end of the stamp duty holiday, which prompted many to go through sooner,' says Matt Coulson, director at Heron Financial. 'Banks want your business and will be making decisions to win it.'

HSBC is the latest lender to launch an extremely low-interest deal, offering a two-year fixed rate of just 0.89 per cent. However, it is only available to those with 40 per cent deposits

The Bank of England base rate is also sitting at a historic low of 0.1 per cent, and set to stay that way for some time.

While mortgage rates are not tied to the base rate, they usually rise and fall with it, as it dictates the cost at which banks can borrow money.

Finally, banks are keen to get more low-risk business on their books by lending to those with bigger deposits.

This effectively balances out the riskier 5 per cent deposit mortgages they have been offering - with substantially higher interest rates - at the other end of the scale.

Not all can grab a super-low rate but some go sub-1%

Though interest rates are falling across the board, they still vary widely across the market.

While those with 40 per cent deposits are getting very cheap deals, first-time buyers with just 5 per cent to put down can still pay interest rates as high as 4 per cent, for example.





Below if roughly how the best deals break down outside the 20 per cent-plus deposit or equity bracket.

20 - 30 per cent deposits

While not as low as those with 40 per cent deposits, mortgages for those with 25 or 30 per cent deposits are now edging closer to the sub-1 per cent bracket.

Platform is the only lender to have gone sub-1 per cent for those with 25 per cent deposits so far, offering a two-year fixed rate of 0.99 per cent with a hefty £1,249 fee.

HSBC also launched a five-year fix for those with 25 per cent deposits at 1.19 per cent with a £999 fee – the lowest rate available on those terms.

At the 20 per cent deposit level, the lowest rate available is Platform's 1.49 per cent with a £749 fee on a two-year fix, while the cheapest fee-free option is Marsden BS's 1.85 per cent.

Those with 25 or 30 per cent deposits to put down could now find that they have access to rates less than 1 per cent, though most come with large arrangement fees

5-15 per cent deposits

If you have a 15 per cent deposit then you will still get a highly competitive rate, albeit some way off the best.

Rates jump significantly for those with deposits of 10 per cent, typically first-time buyers.

Halifax has the lowest rate on a two-year fix at 2.19 per cent, though with a £1,199 fee. The cheapest fee-free option is NatWest's 2.48 per cent on a two-year fix.

Those with smaller deposits wanting to fix for longer will need to pay closer to 3 per cent interest, but this could be worth it as they won't need to pay the costs of switching again in two years' time.

The lowest rate available for a 10 per cent deposit on a five-year fix is HSBC's 2.79 per cent with a £999 fee, while the cheapest fee-free deal is Atom Bank's 2.99 per cent, which also comes with £500 cashback.

Five per cent deposit borrowers will need to pay over 3 per cent interest.

Atom Bank offers the lowest two-year fixed rate at 3.09 per cent with a £900 fee, and also a fee-free deal with 3.39 per cent interest and £500 cashback.

Beware: Fees can cancel out an ultra-cheap rate

As the above examples show, all of the attention-grabbing low-interest deals charge significant arrangement fees - so these need to be factored in to the total cost of the mortgage.

Once borrowers add the fee in to their monthly payment, the deal may not be as cheap as it first seemed.

Don't use the low rate as a bragging right, as that could hit your back pocket hard

'What people need to bear in mind is the lowest headline rate deals aren't always the best deals,' says Paul Neal of brokers Missing Element Mortgage Services.

'Most have a product fee added, which can be up to £1,499, making a 1 per cent-plus mortgage product the cheaper option.

'We would always recommend you seek advice and don't use the low rate as a bragging right, as that could hit your back pocket hard.'

Count the cost: Arrangement fees get lower if the borrowers pays a higher interest rate

There are also broker's fees and valuation costs to consider in some cases. For example, Halifax's super-low 0.83 per cent rate is only available via selected brokers, who may or may not charge a fee.

Halifax also charges for a basic valuation - one of the only large lenders to do so.

'The Halifax are about the only high street lender still charging for a basic valuation, which means that for many people the cheapest deal overall often lies elsewhere,' says Rhys Schofield, managing director at Peak Mortgages and Protection.

Cheapest two-year fixed mortgages on £300,000 home with 40% deposit Provider Interest rate Fee Annual cost Barclays 1.12% £0 £8,258 Platform 1.26% £0 (£250 cashback) £8,272 Nationwide 1.14% £0 £8,454 NatWest 0.94% £745 £8,454 HSBC 0.89% £999 £8,533 Nationwide 0.94% £999 £8,581 Halifax 0.87% £1,199 £8,613 Barclays 0.92% £1,249 £8,687 Halifax 0.83% £1,499 £8,725

To illustrate how fees can affect the overall cost of a mortgage, we took the example of a borrower buying a £300,000 home with a 40 per cent deposit of £120,000, so a total mortgage amount of £180,000.

On Halifax's 0.83 per cent interest mortgage, they would pay £8,725 per year on a two-year fixed term.

But if they took Halifax's slightly higher-interest deal at 0.87 per cent, they would actually pay less per year at £8,613, because the deal has a lower arrangement fee.

Raymond Boulger, senior mortgage technical manager at broker John Charcol, says: 'Halifax's 0.83 per cent, two-year fix will only be the cheapest deal for anyone borrowing at least £600,000.

Halifax's 0.83 per cent mortgage will only be the cheapest deal for anyone borrowing at least £600,000 Raymond Boulger, John Charcol

'Those borrowing less than who want a two-year fixed rate would be better off with an alternative two-year fix from Halifax which has a rate of 0.87 per cent, but a fee of £999.'

The total annual cost could be even lower if they chose a deal with no upfront fee. By doing this, the borrower in our example could save more than £450 a year compared to Halifax's super-low deal.

Whether or not a higher-interest deal would save a buyer money depends on the amount of their mortgage, so it is important to check based on individual circumstances.

This can be done using our true cost mortgage calculator, while our mortgage comparison service, powered by L&C, also shows total cost over deal term taking fees into account.

We also examined the annual costs for a buyer purchasing the same £300,000 home with a 25 per cent deposit, again on a two-year fixed term.

Again, the lowest-interest mortgage - Platform's 0.99 per cent product - came out the highest based on the annual cost.

The buyer would be £130 per year better off if they chose HSBC's mortgage at a much higher interest rate with no upfront fee.

Will rates stay low and should borrowers hold out?

With rates changing so quickly, mortgage borrowers considering a switch will want to know two things: how low rates could potentially go, and when the tide will turn and they will begin to rise.

Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to either of these questions.

This is Money asked mortgage brokers how low they thought rates could go, and there was little consensus.

In a quick straw poll, almost half said they thought that rates for those with lots of equity would bottom out at between 0.75 and 0.79 per cent, just slightly lower than where they are now.

Buying spree: The pandemic housing boom has helped to lower rates, but brokers admit there is no knowing how long these cheap mortgage deals will stick around for

However, almost a third said they would fall to 0.69 per cent or lower, with one even predicting that they could go as low as 0.5 per cent.

In the more conservative camp is Hina Bhudia, partner at Knight Frank Finance.

'It may be the case that we see some more very marginal cuts, but 0.83 per cent or thereabouts is likely to be as low - or close to as low - as they'll go in this cycle,' she says. 'For buyers that qualify, now is the time to lock that rate in.'

Bhudia says that the next round of cuts will benefit those with smaller deposits, instead of driving rates even lower for the equity-rich.

This means those customers may do well to hold out, rather than switching deals now.

'Rather than rates dropping much further from some of these all-time lows, we expect more movement to take place at higher loan-to-value ratios over the coming months – that will be a boon for buyers that were overlooked during the pandemic, particularly first-time buyers.'

Other brokers envision rates for 40 per cent deposit borrowers dropping far lower than the current 0.83 per cent floor.

'With so many lenders consistently improving their pricing to offer super-cheap rates I would not bet against a lender offering a 0.5 per cent fix soon,' says Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial.

Ultimately, it is a call for borrowers to make. 'How long they stay [at this level] is anyone's guess, and if someone tells you they know, they're lying,' says Lewis Shaw of Shaw Financial Services.

And everything must be viewed in context. Even if rates did drop lower, 0.83 per cent still represents a historical low, and much less than homeowners who took out their loans pre-pandemic are currently paying.

Is it worth exiting early - and paying the penalty - to bag a low rate? For borrowers on their mortgage lender's standard variable rate - the higher 'default' rate that homeowners drop on to after their fixed deal ends, currently around 3 to 4 per cent for most lenders - there will be no exit fee, so switching makes sense. But for those already tied into a two- or five-year fixed rate, there is still a chance they could save money by switching to one of the new low-interest deals, even if they did have to pay an early repayment charge to exit their current deal. 'Recently we have seen clients who have benefited from paying the early redemption charge on their existing mortgage as the new rate is so much better,' says Matt Coulson, director at broker Heron Financial. This depends on your individual circumstances, however, so checking early repayment charges and carefully calculating monthly payments, fees and compound interest - or getting a broker to do it for you - is vital.

Speaking to a broker could help homeowners establish whether choosing a five-year fix on today's interest rates could save them money in the long term

Should borrowers consider a five-year fix?

Two-year fixed rates are the most popular with UK mortgage borrowers, with many preferring the flexibility that they offer in case they need to move house, for example.

But for those who are confident they will be staying put, now could be the time to consider a longer fix.

Not only could they lock in a low rate for longer on a five-year fix, but they would also avoid paying fees again when they remortgaged in two years' time.

Says Boulger: 'The difference between rates fixed for two and five years is small and borrowers need to consider carefully whether a longer term fix, say for 5 years, would suit them better.

'For example for mortgages with 40 per cent deposits or more, the monthly cost on a £200,000, 25 year repayment mortgage at 0.99 per cent is £753 per month, whereas a two-year fix at 0.83 per cent would cost £738.

'The saving with the two year fix of £15 per month over two years is £360, whereas the fees to switch to another deal in two years time are likely to be more than that.'

Its stock is a steal after another washout summer hit travel firms hard, according to analyst Gerald Khoo at Liberum, who bumped IAG from ‘hold’ to ‘buy’.

He believes the current price is an ‘attractive entry point’ and urged investors get behind the FTSE 100 giant. Its shares rose 1.3 per cent, or 2.12p, to 168.98p.

Ready for take-off: Analysts at Liberium say they are confident air travel will make a convincing recovery and have tipped BA owner IAG is being tipped as a good long-term bet

IAG gains helped push the FTSE 100 to a fresh 18- month high, rising 0.8 per cent, up 59.1 points, to 7220.14.

British Airways is IAG’s major earner, but it has a stable of carriers including Aer Lingus and Iberia, which has helped it survive the slump in transatlantic flights since the pandemic broke out.

Liberum had been conservative about airlines this summer – but Khoo said it has been even more disappointing than feared.

However IAG could be a good long-term bet. Khoo said: ‘The path to recovery from the pandemic will be neither straight nor simple, but we are confident air travel will make a convincing recovery in the medium term, and IAG remains a structural winner.’

Stock Watch - Xeros Xeros Technology Group tumbled as the washing machine maker said the rampant spread of the Delta Covid variant in India would hold back product launches. Machines will not go on sale until next year, a delay of a few months from a previous schedule of late 2021. AIM-listed Xeros said it was ‘not expected to reduce the medium and long-term prospects for success’, but warned that licensing revenues would be hit this year. Shares in the group, which recently sold its first commercial washing machine in the country, fell 7.6 per cent, or 15.75p, to 191.75p.

In the short term it has lots of cash available and the strongest slot position at Heathrow, which is still one of the world’s major hubs and the ‘largest and most attractive origin and destination in Europe’.

Liberum’s deep-dive came as Heathrow said more people had travelled through the airport. Its terminals handled 1.5m people in July, though this is still far below the start of the pandemic.

Hostelworld also said it was seeing the green shoots of recovery.

Revenue was down a bruising 76 per cent in the six months to June 30, compared with the same period of last year. Bookings fell 73 per cent from 1.1m to around 300,000.

But boss Gary Morrison said customers were booking beds and rooms at places where travel restrictions had been lifted, such as southern Europe, and in the US, where people are opting for staycations.

Shares rose in early trading but closed flat at 95p. The Irish holiday group was one of a slew of firms to give financial updates.

Doorstep lender Provident Financial rose 10.2 per cent, or 31.2p, to 338.4p, despite losses widening to £44million as its consumer credit division was ordered to pay millions back to customers sold unaffordable loans from 2007 to 2020.

Excluding its consumer credit division, profits jumped to £63.5million from £5million last year.

The FTSE 250 rose 0.8 per cent, or 184.78 points, to 23756.83. The index was boosted by advances in BP (up 0.9 per cent, or 2.8p, to 311.7p) and Royal Dutch Shell (up 1 per cent, or 14p, to 1481.4p) shares.

They rose even though oil prices stumbled after White House officials urged Opec+, a cartel including Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia, to increase production above what they have agreed.

The US says this would help keep fuel price inflation in check.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said: ‘Higher gasoline costs, if left unchecked, risk harming the ongoing global recovery.

‘President Biden has made clear that he wants Americans to have access to affordable and reliable energy, including at the pump.

Competitive energy markets will ensure reliable and stable energy supplies, and OPEC+ must do more.’ Brent crude fell 1pc to hover at $70 a barrel.

Over on AIM, cancer therapy developer Bivictrix Therapeutics had a stellar first day of trading.

The company is led by one of the youngest female chief executives in the biotech field, 33-year-old Tiffany Thorn.

Its treatments help differentiate between cancerous and healthy cells, enabling doctors to be more precise and potentially give higher doses of medication. It listed at 20p but finished at 25.5p, a rise of 27.5 per cent.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@British police chiefs claim a recent crackdown on catalytic converter thefts in recent months has already seen cases in the crimewave fall by more than half.

Thefts of the emission-reducing devices - which in many cases are sawn off the underside of vehicles - peaked in March 2021, with 3,245 recorded instances in the UK that month.

However, thefts have steadily declined since, with 1,378 reported cases in July.

A calculated sting on gangs behind the the spate of thefts, as well as increased efforts to watermark the valuable parts, are said to have put a stranglehold on the crime epidemic.

Police crackdown on catalytic crimewave is having an impact: Cases of stolen devices from cars peaked at 3,245 in March but fell to just 1,378 instances in July following a sting on criminal gangs spearheading the thefts and the introduction of covert tracking of devices

A surge in the price of precious metals saw the theft of catalytic converters become a national issue earlier this year, and police across the UK joined forces to combat the growing trend.

The devices - which are fitted to all petrol cars manufactured from 1993 - are there to reduce the harmful pollutants emitted from vehicle exhaust pipes.

They do this by taking the gases produced and converting them into water vapour and less harmful emissions, via a series of chemical reactions triggered by metals, including palladium, rhodium and platinum.

These materials have shot up in value in recent years - and criminal gangs have become all too aware of this small fortune stored beneath your vehicle.

Not only have thefts caused significant headaches for motorists facing big repair bills, but they have also written off many older vehicles.

Prime targets have been older hybrid cars, like the Toyota Prius, Honda Jazz Hybrid and Lexus RX, which have catalytic converters with a higher concentration of these precious metals.

If significant damage is caused when criminals saw the emission devices from the exhaust system, insurer may deem the cost to fix the issue 'uneconomical' due to the value of the motor, thus writing it off entirely.

Catalytic converters have been marked with a uniquely formulated and heat-resistant solution created by SmartWater, which is linked on the database to a specific vehicle. SmartWater scientists can identify the vehicle it came from with just a fragment of the solution, increasing the chance of thieves being caught

A surge in the price of precious metals that can be extracted from catalytic converters has seen thefts become a national issue earlier this year, and police across the UK joined forces to combat the growing trend

In April, British Transport Police (BTP) coordinated a multi-agency operation to tackle to problem.

More than a thousand stolen catalytic converters were recovered and more than 50 people were arrested as part of increased efforts to accost the gangs behind the crimewave, which is most prominent in the capital.

During the week, over a thousand vehicles were also forensically marked by officers and partner agencies.

Toyota also announced in May it was to spend £1million water-marking the parts on 100,000 older vehicles serviced via its franchised garages this year.

Car makers generally have also reduced the amount of the premium materials in the devices in a bid to make them less attractive to thieves.

Toyota's bid to catch cat burglars red handed: The car maker's UK arm has been handed £1million to watermark catalytic converters on over 100,000 used models as part of increased efforts to help police catch criminal gangs behind the spike in robberies in recent years

Police set up a national asset database to register catalytic converters, allowing a specialist team to identify whether recovered devices are stolen.

The portal, operated by the Centre for Infrastructure and Asset Protection (CIAP), an intelligence unit made up of analysts who are accredited police contractors, has allowed for the tracking of organised crime groups around the UK by following the covertly-marked parts and where they are being sold to metal dealers.

Rachael Oakley, director of CIAP is spearheading a new a national scheme for MOT test centres to come onboard to help protect the remaining 26 million unprotected vehicles on the UK’s roads.

Number of catalytic converter thefts reported in 2021 January: 2,217 February: 3,200 March: 3,245 April: 2,083 May: 2,320 June: 1,940 July: 1,378 Source: Figures revealed by National Police Chiefs' Council

'We’re delighted but not surprised that this police initiative is deterring theft of catalytic converters, as criminals avoid traceable property, whether it’s vehicle parts, copper cable or jewellery,' she said.

'We are now calling on the UK’s aftermarket industry to join us, get involved and help roll this out nationwide.'

National Police Chiefs' Council lead for vehicle crime, Cheshire Police assistant chief constable Jenny Simms, said: 'It's pleasing to see that we are already seeing positive results from this multi-agency operation, however we know that there is still a long way to go.

'Policing and law enforcement agencies will continue to work with manufacturers and other partners to focus on catalytic converter theft and ensure that this crime, perceived as low risk/high-reward is relentlessly targeted, and offenders are brought to justice.'

National Police Chiefs' Council lead for metal crime, BTP assistant chief constable Charlie Doyle, added: 'We recognise the disruptive and costly impact catalytic converter theft has on victims, so we're very pleased that we are starting to see it decreasing.

'This positive reduction is testament to why it's vital we join forces to share information and specialist knowledge to disrupt those operating in this area of crime.'

Police officials says reports of catalytic converter theft should be made as soon as possible to increase the chances of detection.

People are encouraged to report any suspicious activity to the police by calling 101, or 999 if an offence is in progress. If you spot something at a railway station, contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40.

Alternatively, anonymous reports can be made to Crimestoppers online or by calling 0800 555111.

The Scrap Metal Dealers Act was introduced in 2013 to force scrap-metal businesses to better vet sellers and not accept cash sales. However, abuse of the system means thieves still have an easy means of benefiting from the sale of valuable catalytic converters

Edmund King, AA president, said catalytic converter theft is a major problem that has caused 'immense financial hardship and personal trauma' for vehicle owners.

He added: 'The AA has been working with the police and manufacturers such as Toyota to reduce the number of thefts by water-marking catalytic converters and providing intelligence on where offences have been occurring.

'Ten per cent of AA members know someone who has suffered from this crime and 35 per cent are worried but have not taken action to protect their vehicle, whereas 21 per cent have taken action.

'The drop in cases is a combination of police targeting of organised gangs and drivers, manufacturers and the AA taking preventative action. However, drivers need to be wary that some of these gangs may shift their tactics away from the larger urban conurbations to more remote areas.

'Drivers need to remain vigilant and consider remedial action such as fitting catalytic converter cages and being careful where they park.'

Organised criminals are scouring the streets for vehicles that are easy targets, carrying car jacks and tools to quickly remove the exhaust devices in another vehicle so they can make a quick getaway

Ham-fisted catalytic converter thieves are writing motors off

Organised gangs use jacks to lift vehicles off the ground to allow for easy access to the valuable devices.

While more skilled thieves are unscrewing them from the underside of cars, others are taking a more ham-fisted approach and sawing them off the exhaust system, causing irreversible damage and resulting in some owners having to replace entire exhaust systems.

Devices to secure your catalytic converter Concerned drivers can can purchase devices that lock in around the converter to make it more difficult to remove. Providers include Catloc and Catclamp, which can be installed on a number of different vehicles. However, they're not cheap, with prices as high as £250 for some models.

And because there is often no third party to claim against, drivers using their polices to cover repair costs are also losing their No Claims Discount, unless otherwise protected.

Some of those who have had the device stolen can face long waits to obtain a new one and get their car back on the road, thanks to the increase in thefts and fast-developing supply issues with parts.

This means they are unable to use their cars until a replacement part is fitted, else face fines.

Motoring association MotorEasy analysed 10,000 garage bills for This is Money in 2020 and found the average cost to replace a catalytic converter is up to £1,300, with over £900 of the cost being parts.

Zurich, based on claims by its customers, said the average payout for damages caused by catalytic converter thieves is over £1,200.

However, the AA says claims have amounted to anything between £2,000 and £3,000 when the devices have been sawed away from the exhaust.

Previous research by AA Insurance identified a marked increase in claims made by motorists who had catalytic converters pinched from their parked cars - some having had them stolen twice from the same motor.

The catalytic converter is part of a vehicle's exhaust system. Criminals in a hurry are sawing them off, causing irreversible damage that can result in repair bills of up to £3,000

Innocent drivers who fall victim to this crime also face punishment if they are caught driving their cars without a cat.

Motorists caught by police driving a vehicle knowing the catalytic converter has been removed can be fined up to £1,000, because the car will be producing higher levels of pollution than they are allowed to.

However, the additional sound the exhaust makes when a catalytic converter has been removed and not replaced will be so loud that motorists will be well aware there's something amiss.

While the vehicle will still be driveable, removal of the device will trigger a warning light on the dashboard, reduce fuel economy and cause plenty of headaches from extra exhaust roar.

Toyota cars in particular have been targeted, with the devices fitted to the exhaust systems of the Japanese brands' hybrid models containing a higher concentration of precious metals and being generally less corroded.

Hybrid cars are ripe for thieves as the catalytic converters contain a higher concentration of precious metals and are generally less corroded. It's no surprise then that the Toyota Prius - the most-bought hybrid in the UK - is among the list of cars criminals are preying on

The Toyota Auris hybrid (left) - the sister car to the Prius - has also been identified as a prime target. The Lexus RX hybrid SUV (right) is another model that's often preyed on by thieves of catalytic converters
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vectura's board faces a tough decision over the inhaler maker's future as they weigh up offers from a cigarette giant and a private equity firm.

Marlboro-maker Philip Morris International (PMI) and Carlyle both want the Wiltshire company.

The pair have been outbidding one another for months and this week almost went head-to-head in a rare auction process.

Bidding battle: UK inhaler maker Vectura is being pursued by Marlboro-maker Philip Morris International and private equity firm Carlyle

Carlyle withdrew before it had started by declaring its bid of £958million, or 155p per share, final. PMI's most recent bid stands at £1.02billion, or 165p, and puts it in pole position to take over.

Yesterday, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Vectura's board 'must exercise their duty of care to all stakeholders, resist Philip Morris, and say they don't want to be bought by Big Tobacco'.

Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets, said: 'These bids are a problem. The best place for the company to grow is in the public markets.

'It is now a choice for the Vectura board between the devil and the deep blue sea. Investors who wanted to stick long term with Vectura have been done over.'

PMI wants Vectura's tech to turn itself into a 'healthcare and wellness' firm. It has pledged to use its global reach to help Vectura sell its products.

But campaigners are sceptical about PMI's motives. Malcolm Clark, senior cancer prevention policy manager at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Becoming tobacco-owned would also threaten the vital work done by Vectura.'

Nicholas Hopkinson, chairman of Action on Smoking and Health, added: 'From a financial point of view it may be the highest offer but it will kill the company.'

Others view private equity giant Carlyle as worse, saying Vectura could be asset stripped and sold again. But Vectura's board has hinted it agrees with those taking an ethical health stand.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Increasing numbers of DIY investors are deciding to buy individual shares in their SIPPs and ISAs to grow their wealth, and well they might given the hugely democratising influence of the internet.

Information on companies has never been as easily accessible as it is today, which makes the job of picking good stocks something private investors can participate in, if they’re willing to put in the elbow grease to thoroughly research their potential purchases.

But what are the metrics and resources investors should turn to when selecting investments?

Retail investors must consider a range of metrics before selecting a stock to invest in

Probably the biggest store of valuable information for investors lies in the results and reports presented by companies to the stock market.

Institutional investors have no special treatment compared to private investors here; the results are delivered to the market as a whole at the same time, and for UK stocks can be found on the London Stock Exchange website at 7am each day, or on companies’ investor relations websites.

These reports are a treasure trove of information. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, picks some key things to look out for.

Earnings Per Share

One of the most important figures in company results is the Earnings Per Share (EPS) figure. This tells investors what profits the company is making for each share they hold.

There are two main ways to look at this figure. First, consider how it compares with prior periods to see if earnings are heading in the right direction, taking into account any one-off boosts or dents in profits that aren’t repeatable.

The Chief Executive’s commentary which goes along with the results should alert you to such factors, particularly the ‘outlook’, which looks ahead to the following year.

Second, divide the share price by the Earnings Per Share figure to derive the Price Earnings ratio, which is a measure of how expensive the shares are compared to the profits the company generates. Make sure you only use the annual Earnings Per Share figure in this calculation - you will get a wonky ratio if you use the earnings from a half year report because you’re only looking at part of the picture.

Alternatively, you can also get the Price Earnings ratio from other sources such as the websites of some investment platforms, brokers and media outlets. You might be willing to invest in companies with higher Price Earnings ratios if you think there are good prospects for those earnings to grow quickly.

Dividends

The dividend is another key figure in the reports and accounts for investors to mull, especially income seekers. Again, it’s a good idea to compare it with previous periods to see if the income payment to shareholders is growing.

It’s also worth comparing the dividend per share to the earnings per share and considering how big a proportion of profits are being paid out as dividends. If it’s a high percentage, it may be a sign that dividend growth is likely to be limited, or in extreme cases that the dividend is unsustainable.

You can also divide the dividend per share by the share price to derive the stock’s historic yield, which again is available on many investment websites free of charge.

Of course, there are some companies which don’t pay a dividend, preferring instead to reinvest profits in the business, and here this measure can’t be used. Big tech companies like Amazon and Alphabet are renowned for this growth-hungry approach which shuns dividends.

Profit margins

It's worth also looking at a firm’s profit margin. Usually this will be presented in the results, and it tells you what percentage of revenues flows through into profits, which ultimately determine a company’s performance.

A low profit margin means a company has little room for error or misfortune before slipping into the red, while a larger margin means the company is better placed to weather any storms while still turning a profit.

Bear in mind some industries simply have low margins, for instance supermarkets and construction. While it may be less of an issue for the former as consumer demand for groceries is relatively stable, construction projects can often run late or over budget, wiping out profits and leading to losses - precisely what happened to Carillion before it collapsed.

Debt

Investors should also pay heed to how much debt a company is carrying. In annual results, net debt is the key figure here. Again you can compare with previous periods to see if it’s heading in the wrong direction, which could be a warning sign.

You can also divide net debt by EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) as this figure is often provided in the results.

This ratio gives an indication of how many years it would take a company to pay off all its debt at current levels of profitability. Generally a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 2 is considered healthy, and a ratio above 3 starts to raise eyebrows.

Broker forecasts and ratings

There are plenty of other measures to look for in the results too, if you really want to roll your sleeves up, and also other resources you can use outside company reports which might help.

Laith Khalaf: Investors should give thought to portfolio diversification

For instance, on their investor relations websites, many large companies will provide the average of professional analysts’ estimates of earnings in the forthcoming year (known as the consensus estimate). This can give you an idea of market expectations for a stock, and in the short term, share price movements will be guided by how actual performance measures up to these forecasts.

Broker ratings are also available on many websites, which tell you whether analysts rate a company as a buy, hold or sell.

These don’t tend to be very useful however, as there are usually as many saying sell as there are hold or buy. And when there is clear analyst agreement on a stock, that’s usually baked into the price.

Overall you might want to look at analyst ratings and estimates to get an idea of how the market views a stock, but it shouldn’t play a major part in your investment decision. Analysts tend to focus heavily on the next twelve months, whereas investors should be thinking about becoming an owner of a company for five to ten years or more.

Portfolio diversification

As well as picking good companies to hold for the long term, investors should of course give some thought to portfolio diversification. If all the companies you select are in the same country, or in the same industry, then your portfolio will be extremely vulnerable to a downturn in those areas. So make sure you’ve got a good spread of investments.

You should also make sure there are enough companies in your portfolio to minimise the impact of one performing particularly poorly, or worse still, going bust.

As a rule of thumb, the professional fund managers with the most concentrated portfolios still have around 30 stocks in there. That probably sounds like quite a lot for most private investors, particularly seeing as you need to regularly review your holdings as well as picking them in the first place.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@To say it's not an easy time to be in aviation is an understatement. The pandemic has grounded thousands of planes and driven down the value of UK aerospace and defence companies, leaving them prey to foreign predators and private equity.

But two former Harrier jump jet pilots, Andy Offer, 55, and Chris Norton, 56, believe they can fly through the gloom that has engulfed the sector.

They set up their company, 2 Excel Aviation, after leaving the RAF.

On patrol: The bulk of 2Excel's work is for governments, the oil industry and the Ministry of Defence, including a contract to help the coastguard

Initially, they took customers on flights and put on displays at air shows as The Blades aerobatics team.

Having started out with five people and four aircraft, the company now has more than 400 staff and a fleet of 30 planes.

The business has branched out into repair and maintenance, testing for the Team Tempest fighter jet programme, surveillance services for the coastguard and dispersing oil spills.

Earlier this year, the 2 Excel Aviation completed a refinancing with Signal Capital Partners, and a stock market float is on the cards in the next two to four years.

Andy and Chris have already weathered one major patch of turbulence before the pandemic.

When the financial crisis struck in 2008, their original aerobatics business was badly hit.

'We knew we had to diversify from the Blades,' says Andy. 'But they were a good calling card.'

'At the time it was horrible but it was the best thing in hindsight.'

Andy, who joined the military straight from school and did several tours in Afghanistan, became the leader of the Red Arrows.

But despite an exciting life in the RAF, he was drawn to the world of business.

'I was always entrepreneurial. I loved the air force but found it frustrating.'

High flyers: 2Excel Aviation founders Andy Offer and Chris Norton believe they can fly through the gloom that has engulfed the sector since the pandemic began

He adds: 'Having said that, some of the military disciplines are superb. People are not late for work or late for meetings. They don't take sick days or days off.

'They work well as a team,' he adds. 'The Red Arrows is a high-performing team and what that means is harmony.'

From its main bases at Doncaster airport and Lasham Airfield in Hampshire, 2 Excel provides a range of aviation services.

Some of these, such as charter planes for VIPs including top football teams, have been hit in the pandemic, but much of its business has not been badly affected.

The bulk of its work is for governments, the oil industry and the Ministry of Defence, including a contract to help the coastguard.

Advanced sensors on 2 Excel's aircraft can spot a human being in the sea from more than 20 miles away, so those in distress can be located more easily. In one episode, a Spanish fishing boat had a badly injured crew member on board.

'He has to get to a hospital or he is going to die,' says Andy. 'But this is right on the limits of endurance for a search-and-rescue helicopter.

'So the helicopter can't faff around. The job of the our King Air plane was to find the fishing boat on its radar. They had a script in Spanish to talk to the trawler captain.

'By the time the helicopter came, the crew knew what to do.

'That meant the helicopter could be in and out as quickly as possible. They took the fisherman to hospital in Cornwall, and his life was saved.'

Another service is a 24/7 crisis spill response for the oil industry. 2 Excel has two Boeing 727s with a special oil dispersant system, operated out of Doncaster airport.

2 Excel is also designing a flight-test aircraft, based on a Boeing 757, for the Team Tempest fighter jet programme.

All the sensors and electronics will be tested on the aeroplane, the only flying test bed of its kind outside the US.

A sister operation, 2 Excel Engineering, which specialises in maintenance and repairs, is based in Lasham and is run by Chris.

Team work: Andy was leader of the Red Arrows, which are famous for their synchronised moves

He and Andy decided to buy the business out of administration in 2015, because it was providing the maintenance services for 2 Excel aircraft, and other options were thin on the ground.

'When it went bust, we thought 'Holy Cow, what do we do now?' says Chris.

'It went under overnight, and our aeroplane was in bits on the floor. So we decided to rebuild Lasham. We had to fix the reasons it went bust. Primarily it was lack of investment over a long period and it was losing customers.'

Chris set about investing in the site, putting down a new floor, revamping the derelict engineering workshop and creating a production line.

'More importantly, we had to solve cultural issues. When I put everything on a chart that we needed to fix, my production manager resigned,' he says.

'But we are very important to 2 Excel Aviation.

'We would never have won the contract for Team Tempest if we hadn't had this place.'

Trying to turn around the engineering business at Lasham has been bruising.

One of the problems, Chris admits, is that staff with years of experience were reluctant to change the way they worked. 'I had zero credibility with them because I was a pilot, not an engineer. You have to be quite thick-skinned,' he says.

Ahead of the pandemic, his division had over-expanded 'so we were in a cash hole when Covid hit', he explains.

'It was terrible, we were in a cash hurt locker.

'We are reconfiguring for the new realities. We have taken some hard choices and we have been able to balance the books.'

The engineering division is likely to be folded into the main business ahead of a float.

Andy and Chris want to fly the flag for British aviation at a time when a string of firms in the aerospace sector including Ultra Electronics, Meggitt, Cobham, Senior and Signature have been targeted by US private equity predators.

'For our industry, short-termism is not good,' says Andy.

'Our customers are long term and they don't want us to be owned by a US private equity house because it will change what we do.

'We nearly did a deal but we realised pretty quickly it would have been an asset strip.

'We are proud of the fact we are British, that our money is staying here and that we are delivering UK solutions.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Transport Minister, Grant Shapps, announced this week that the Government has commissioned the Royal College of Art to design electric vehicle charging points that are 'as iconic and recognisable as the British phone box, London bus or black cab'.

With MPs under pressure to ramp-up the installation of public charging devices to match the boom in sales of EVs - and develop a suitable infrastructure ahead of the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 - the legendary art school's creation could be seen on our roadsides by 2022.

The Government wants a design that makes them easy for drivers to spot but also incorporate 'British designs of old that are recognised the world over'.

However, at the same time the announcement was made, a new trial in the capital has seen the introduction of a revolutionary near-invisible solution that proves there might be no need for permanent charging points and extra clutter at the roadside.

Chargepoints as 'iconic and recognisable as the British phone box, London bus or black cab': The Government announced this week that it has commissioned the Royal College of Art to come up with a standardised - but stand-out - design for public charging devices

The request for the design of an 'iconic' new device is intended to turn British EV charging points into landmarks, with the intention to reveal the final creation in the lead-up to November's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.

Shapps has handed responsibility for the devices to the Royal College of Art and PA Consulting, with the remit to create a shape that helps to raise awareness of the transition to electric vehicles.

'Excellent design plays a key role in supporting our transition to zero emission vehicles, which is why I want to see EV chargepoints that are as iconic and recognisable as the British phone box, London bus or black cab,' said the Secretary of State for Transport - who also happens to own an electric Tesla Model 3.

'With less than three months to go until COP26, we continue to put the UK at the forefront of the design, manufacture and use of zero emission vehicles and their charging infrastructure, as we build back greener and call on countries around the world to similarly accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.'

Clive Grinyer, head of service design at the Royal College of Art, said: 'This is an opportunity to support the design of a future icon that will be part of our national culture as we move towards a sustainable future.

'The RCA has been at the forefront of shaping our products, mobility and services for the last 180 years.

'We are delighted to be playing a role in the design of the total service experience to ensure a usable, beautiful and inclusive design that is an excellent experience for all.'

'Excellent design plays a key role in supporting our transition to zero emission vehicles, which is why I want to see EV chargepoints that are as iconic and recognisable as the British phone box, London bus or black cab,' the Secretary of State for Transport said

Mr Shapps is a proud owner of a Tesla Model 3, which would have set the Transport Minster back more than £40,000 - though he did purchase it shortly before slashing the Plug-in Car Grant earlier this year, meaning only EVs priced under £35,000 qualify for the £2,500 grant

Warwick Goodall, transport and net-zero mobility expert at PA, added: 'We know that excellent design has the power to dismantle barriers to growth and simplify the user experience, making the switch to electric vehicles more attractive, accessible, affordable and secure for drivers.

'We look forward to working together with the public and industry on a design framework that will accelerate the chargepoint rollout ambitions and bring to life the electric vehicle revolution on our streets.'

Forget an iconic design - an invisible one could be better

A trial of revolutionary new public chargepoints has began in the capital in the last fortnight - and it might be a better solution for our roads.

Five new on-street devices from Scottish start-up, Trojan Energy - not to be confused with the trojan computer virus - have been installed in Brent, as part of a 150-wide charger trial that will also take place in Camden in the next six months.

The chargepoints certainly don't fit the 'iconic British design' remit setout by Grant Shapps this week - that's because you won't be able to see them.

While Shapps wants instantly recognisable chargepoints, a trial already underway in London is testing completely invisible EV charging solutions

Instead of a fixed charging post, the Trojan Energy solution is a hardwearing mount that's fitted flush into the pavement.

It is flat and tough enough to walk or drive over, meaning they won't obscure the footpath as fixed charging devices do currently.

Those with access to the points are provided with their own charging 'lance' - a personal charge post they can slot into the mounting point when they need to top up the batteries in their EV.

Once the charging session has ended, the lance is removed and stored in the car again.

The aim is to alleviate the need for any additional roadside furniture, meaning our streets wouldn't be taken over by a mass of large charging devices when EVs become more mainstream.

Importantly, the system has been designed with input from Disability Rights UK to improve safety for all street users, with wheelchairs, pushchairs and mobility scooters able to run over the almost-flat charging mounts.

Electric vehicle owners will carry one of these charging lances in their car. When they need to boost the battery in the car, they can attach it to one of 15 mounts located in a network on one street

The concept has been developed by Scottish start-up, Trojan Energy. It is being trialled in Brent and Camden from September to March 2022

The first Trojan Energy chargers have been installed in Mortimer Road in the north-west London borough.

A small group of trial participants will carry out real-world testing of the prototype system to understand the benefits and where improvements can be made.

The full trial of 150 chargepoints across Brent and Camden will go live later in the year.

Each site can have up to 15 of the mounting points installed in parallel from one electricity network connection, with power distributed to that hub of chargers.

Across the two boroughs there will be ten sets of 15 chargers on six streets in total, with over 140 existing EV owners signed up to test the technology from next month until March 2022.

They will benefit from 25p per kilowatt of charging and will be provided with the lances for free.

Up to 15 of the device mounting points are installed in parallel on one street from a single electricity network connection, with power distributed to that hub of chargers

Ian Mackenzie, CEO of Trojan Energy, said: 'We can't wait to see the first driver reactions and hear their feedback so we can generate learnings for the wider project rollouts across Brent and Camden.'

Feedback from the first users 'has been great' as they are so convenient for them, the firm says.

The cost of installation of each hub of 15 chargers will depend on a number of factors, such as layouts, pavement materials and local conditions.

'Once we gain more experience we will release further details on this,' Trojan Energy says.

Commenting on the trial, Transport Minister Rachel Maclean said: 'Innovation is key to creating cleaner, greener local communities – not only in the capital, but right across the country.

'This project is a great example of how technology is being used to solve a real-world problem to ensure that our EV infrastructure fits in seamlessly in our local towns and cities.

'This is crucial as we build back greener and encourage more people to make the switch, which is why I'm delighted this government is backing its delivery.'

Other revolutionary chargepoints that don't add to street furniture

The Trojan Energy devices are the only chargepoints that could help to cut road clutter.

Already in London there are hundreds of streetlights that have been converted to EV chargers as part of a scheme launched by Ubitricity.

Bulbs in the lampposts are switched to low-energy LED versions so that surplus electricity from the existing power supply can be used to charge EVs using a special charging cable from the brand.

Left: Ubitricity first installed lamppost chargers in London in June 2017. Right: A number of boroughs in the capital now have them because they mean there's no additional road furniture

EV owners can plug their vehicles into existing street furniture, meaning picturesque streets can remain almost unchanged

Another solution, launched in Oxford in 2019, is pop-up devices that retract into the ground.

The chargers, provided by Urban Electric, sink into the pavement and can be summoned out of the ground by plug-in vehicle owners when they need to use them.

‹ Slide me › Pop-up power: These are the UK's first retractable street chargers that rise out of the ground. They've were installed in Oxford as part of a six-month trial carried out in 2019-2020

Because the devices fold into themselves, Urban Electric claims you don't have to dig deep into the ground to put them in
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The number of people buying homes through Help to Buy is at an all-time high, according to the latest Government figures - but rising house prices mean users could pay back thousands more than they borrowed.

The latest Help to Buy statistics show that in the financial year 2020-21, more than 55,600 households bought their home with the support of a Help to Buy equity loan.

This was an 8 per cent increase compared to the previous year, as first-time buyers joined in the home-purchasing boom.

On the ladder: First-time buyers used a record number of Help to Buy loans in 2020-21

The average price first-time buyers paid for their home was £290,000, above the national average of around £255,000, and their typical household income was just over £55,000.

A total of 328,506 households have now purchased a home using the scheme since it was introduced in 2013.

More than a half of those purchases were made with a deposit of 5 per cent of the property purchase price or less, and 23 per cent with a deposit ranging between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.

With the scheme set to end in 2023, buyers may be looking to get in under the wire - although the new First Homes scheme could also help them get on the ladder with Government support.

What is a Help to Buy: Equity Loan? First-time buyers can use the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme to purchase a new-build property up to the value of £600,000, with a maximum equity loan of £120,000 (20 per cent). In Greater London, the maximum equity loan is £240,000 (40 per cent). The Government lends borrowers a portion of the purchase price interest-free for five years, allowing them to boost their deposit and get a better mortgage rate. After five years, borrowers must either pay the Government back the current market value of their stake, or start paying interest. They can also repay early if they choose. The interest rate starts at 1.75 per cent in year six, and after that it rises in line with the Retail Price Index measure of inflation plus 1 per cent each year. So someone who bought a £200,000 home with a 20 per cent (£40,000) Help to Buy equity loan would pay £712 interest in year six, and in year 10 they would pay £896 - on top of mortgage payments. The scheme has run since 2013 and will continue until 2023. New restrictions were introduced this year which means it is now only open to first-time buyers, and there are regional limits meaning homes purchased must cost no more than 1.5 times the average first time buyer property price in that area.

Though the equity loan scheme has helped buyers get on the ladder at a time when house prices have risen by £23,000 in a year, past users of Help to Buy are being warned that those same house price increases could mean they end up paying back much more than they borrowed.

Property inflation has made life particularly difficult for first-time buyers, who need to save higher deposits without the benefit of increased equity in an existing property that home movers have.

The equity loan helps with that, but because of its structure, house price rises mean borrowers end up paying back more.

Instead of loans being a set amount borrowed, as a mortgage would be, Help to Buy loans are taken as a stake in the property - meaning that as a home rises in value, so too does the amount needing to eventually be repaid to the state.

Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: ‘Help to Buy equity loans provide an answer to the impossible question of how to buy in a rapidly rising property market.

'Most people who use them have a 5 per cent deposit, and the scheme stops them battling to raise a bigger percentage of the property price at a time when the average property rose more than £27,000 in a year.

‘However, while Help to Buy loans offer a solution to those struggling to buy in a rising market, the way they work means the same rising market will have a sting in the tail for anyone who takes advantage.

‘When the loan is eventually repaid to the Government, the amount that needs to be paid back depends on the value of the house at that time. If you borrow 20 per cent of the purchase price, you repay 20 per cent of the value after five years, so when prices rise, so do your repayments.’

According to Hargreaves Lansdown's analysis, if a buyer borrowed 20 per cent from the Government to buy the average property in May 2015, and then repaid the loan in May 2020, they would have to pay back £5,318 more than they borrowed.

The rising market in the past 12 months means that someone doing the same a year later would have had to repay £8,751 more than they borrowed - so the rising market would have cost them almost £3,500.

Buyers rushed to cash in Help to Buy Isas ahead of stamp duty deadline

The Government has also published figures on take-up of the Help to Buy Isa.

This is a scheme where the Government tops up deposit savings with a 25 per cent 'bonus,' up to a limit of £3,000, at the point that a borrower buys their home.

The data showed that 12,870 bonuses were paid in March 2021 - a 25 per cent increase on the previous month. This may reflect buyers racing to meet the stamp duty holiday deadline, which was initially set to be in March but was subsequently extended until June.

Use of Help to Buy Isa bonuses also spiked last year amid the house purchasing boom

The bonuses were used to buy 9,904 properties, compared to 7,297 in February.

The mean value of a property completion in the Help to Buy Isa scheme between December 2015 and March 2021 was £175,010, compared to the average first-time buyer price of £214,452 and the average UK house price of £256,405.

Although Help to Buy can be used on properties up to £450,000, only 29,000 or 5 per cent of the 539,000 homes bought under the scheme have been worth more than £250,000.

This reflects the fact that most completions in the scheme have been on properties outside London, in regions where house prices are typically lower.

Applications for new Help to Buy Isas closed in 2019, but existing borrowers can still save into the scheme and claim their bonuses until 2030.

New savers can also use a Lifetime Isa to get a Government bonus on their savings if they are using them to buy their first home.

Says Coles: ‘If you’re working hard to build a deposit, a Help to Buy equity loan isn’t your only option.

'If you’re aged 18-39, and you plan to buy your first property a year or more down the line, you could also consider saving at least some of the deposit in a Lifetime Isa.

'You can put £4,000 a year into a Lisa and the government will immediately top it up by 25 per cent - so you could get £1,000 a year from the Government to help you onto the property ladder. And through the Lisa, this never needs to be paid back.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Marks & Spencer is about to announce six guest brands in clothing and footwear as part of the drive by chief executive Steve Rowe to transform the business after the pandemic.

A selection of items from popular labels including Cornish-based Celtic & Co, sustainable fashion company Albaray and outdoor gear specialist Craghoppers will feature on M&S.com.

The other signings are Fat Face, Jones Bootmaker, and kidswear brand Frugi.

A sign of the times: The retailer is spicing up its fashion by curating a selection of brands it feels are relevant to its customers

The retailer is spicing up its fashion by curating a selection of brands it feels are relevant to its customers. These include Hobbs and Phase Eight, both popular for smart frocks and 'occasionwear'.

Dresses from Ghost, where M&S has a collaboration agreement, and Nobody's Child, have proved a hit with fashionistas.

Marks is also offering lingerie from Sloggi and Triumph alongside its own underwear.

The initiative to act as a platfom for other labels is known as 'Brands at M&S' and was launched in the spring.

As well as clothing, Marks is expanding its beauty offer to include brands such as Boucleme. It has also done deals with kids' stationery brand Smiggle and Clarks shoes.

'Brands at M&S' is mainly online with an in-store trial in Stratford in east London, but is being rolled out on an experimental basis in Argyle Street in Glasgow, Bluewater, Cheshire Oaks, Manchester and the Metro Centre in Gateshead.

Transformation: Boss Steve Rowe

M&S is also showcasing its own brands and in the autumn will be boosting its in-house labels Autograph, athletic wear Goodmove and Per Una, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary. It will later this year launch its first collection from Jaeger, after buying the renowned British fashion name in January for £6m.

The much-loved store chain has seen its market value tumble in the past five years as it has been hit by competition from high street rivals such as Zara, as well as from online operators.

Over the past three years, Rowe and chairman Archie Norman have been engaged in a plan to restore the business to sustainable growth by 'facing the facts' the company had previously failed to address.

Their strategy includes revitalising clothing and home, a £750million food delivery deal with Ocado and the reshaping of the store estate, shutting down shops that are in the wrong places and opening new ones.

M&S shares have risen by 12 per cent this year and the top team hope a recovery is now in their sights. The most recent annual results show that clothing and home was badly affected by lockdown, with net revenues down by 31.5 per cent and an operating loss of £129.4million.

However, online growth of 53.9 per cent was very strong and the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digital. Nearly 2million new customers last summer clicked on M&S. com, which has 13.5million visitors a week. There was a 200 per cent increase in the numbers downloading the M&S app last year.

Early evidence suggests the guest brands attract new customers and encourage people to shop more frequently. Rowe's aim is to deliver an 'omnichannel' clothing and home business, so that the stores and the website work together in tandem, bringing benefits to customers not available from online only retailers.

Another innovation is digital click-and-collect, so customers no longer have to wait at a desk but can instead use self-service digital screens. A trial in 22 shops is being rolled out to a total of 78 branches by Christmas.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tony Hetherington is Financial Mail on Sunday's ace investigator, fighting readers corners, revealing the truth that lies behind closed doors and winning victories for those who have been left out-of-pocket. Find out how to contact him below.

P.L. writes: I have reached an impasse with Nectar, Sainsbury's and Action Fraud over the loss of Nectar points worth more than £500.

I found that points worth £525 were missing from my account, having been spent at three Sainsbury's branches over three days while my wife and I were out of the country.

My local Sainsbury's tried to help, and said the purchases were not typical of our shopping.

But letters to Sainsbury's bosses go unanswered and Nectar has offered no explanation, apology or refund.

Shopping spree: Points were spent at a Sainsbury's store in Pimlico, London, when Nectar card owner was abroad

Tony Hetherington replies: Over the past several months, I have received dozens of complaints from Sainsbury's customers who say their Nectar points have been stolen.

After publishing some of these and warning that Sainsbury's – which owns the Nectar card scheme – was far from helpful, I had not intended to investigate any more.

However, if someone were mugged in the street and robbed of more than £500 I would expect the theft to be taken seriously, so I decided to look closely into what happened to you.

When you made a complaint about the theft, Sainsbury's rejected it, saying there were no suspicious circumstances.

So, since you say you were abroad when your Nectar points were spent, I asked the supermarket what it would take to make it regard the spending as suspicious.

You were also told that the goods bought with your £525 were not out of keeping with your normal shopping.

However, helpful staff at your local Sainsbury's at Balham, in South-West London, flatly contradicted this, so I asked Sainsbury's to say exactly what was bought.

I also asked where your Nectar points were spent. You were told that all the spending was at the Balham store, yet further enquiries show that this was not true and your points were also cashed at two Sainsbury's branches in central London, at Rochester Row and Pimlico.

On top of all this, the real shock came when I realised you had been robbed not once, but twice.

Since you were abroad when your £525 was stolen, and your Nectar cards were with you, this indicated there was a fake Nectar card in existence showing your account details.

You might have expected Sainsbury's to realise this, replace your cards, and flag up the fake card at its tills. Instead, someone clearly holding a party used your recently earned Nectar points to purchase 20 steaks and a large quantity of beer.

Again, I asked Sainsbury's whether this was your typical shopping.

Sainsbury's has now reconsidered and has told me the purchases made with your points do not match your usual shopping.

It admits your claim was turned down because nobody took into account that you were out of the country and not going from branch to branch using up your Nectar points.

However, it dug itself deeper into difficulty by telling me you had failed to report the second theft. In fact, you were able to produce email after email between you and Sainsbury's proving the exact opposite.

Sainsbury's has now cancelled your existing cards and opened a new account for you, with a complete refund of all your stolen points. Ungraciously though, it describes this as 'a gesture of goodwill', rather than treating a theft victim fairly.

I did ask Sainsbury's to say whether a fake card was used by the thief, and how long in-store CCTV recordings were kept.

Since the company claims to have its own Nectar fraud team, I also asked how many people it had prosecuted for stealing points, as the only such record I can find is of the prosecution of a Sainsbury's employee.

Sainsbury's told me it deletes recordings after 31 days, but it refused to say whether your thief used a fake Nectar card, or to reveal how many prosecutions it had brought, if any.

Lack of connection: Vodafone refused to talk to Mrs L.W. as the contract was with her late husband

Vodafone will only talk with my late husband

Mrs L.W. writes: My husband took out a 24-month contract with Vodafone for our grandson. This ended in November last year, but Vodafone collected two further payments of £46.

I complained and was first told it would continue collecting payments unless told to stop. Vodafone then refused to say more as the contract was with my husband. I explained that he had died in 2019, and that I would continue the payments.

But my grandson's phone suddenly stopped working and Vodafone told me his phone number does not exist.

Tony Hetherington replies: You have told me you kept being assured by Vodafone that someone would sort this out but no one did. At one point, Vodafone collected an unexpected £24 from your bank account, but told you that you owed £1.49, which you also paid.

I asked officials at Vodafone's head office to look into what had happened, and two days later you were offered a refund of charges plus a further £50 as a goodwill gesture. Vodafone told me it was normal to continue an expired contract unless the customer instructed otherwise.

It added: 'Unfortunately, we were not aware that the account holder, Mr W, had passed away.'

WE'RE WATCHING YOU The Financial Conduct Authority has warned customers of mini-bonds firm Northern Provident Investments that they may be contacted by fraudsters following the firm's decision ten days ago to put itself into liquidation. 'Rescue deals' that involve handing over more money may well be scams. The Belfast business was fully authorised by the watchdog and used its status to allow investors to put their savings into high-risk bonds. NPI also vetted and approved advertising issued by other companies that marketed these risky IOUs, including Blackmore Bond, which collapsed last year, owing £46million. I warned in April this year that the unlicensed investment firm Your Options Ltd was using NPI's authorised status to give false reassurance to customers tempted by the 7per cent yield on its Choices Bond. The Halifax company claimed NPI had 'all of the relevant protections and permissions', but failed to spell out that these did not include cover under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's high streets desperately need a makeover and Harvey Jenkinson has a plan to help make that happen.

He's got his eye on some of the country's biggest empty shops with a plan to fill them with activities you'd normally expect to find miles from town centres and cities: climbing walls, trampolines, bowling alleys, 'street golf', fitness classes, e-sports and a growing menu of other activities.

The latest giant venue, which includes a go-kart track, opens this weekend in the old 85,000 square foot Debenhams in a shopping centre in Wandsworth, South-West London, taking the total number of Gravity Active centres around the country to 15.

Another 15 are in the pipeline, including more former Debenhams stores as well as clusters of vacant units left by the collapse of Topshop and others casualties.

Driving force: Gravity Active boss Harvey Jenkinson in a go-kart at the old Wandsworth Debenhams store

'It had been a dream of ours to do a really prominent site,' Jenkinson, 39, says from his home in Pocklington, East Yorkshire. 'We'd been telling landlords for a while that's what we wanted, and it's taken the strain of the high street to give us the opportunity.'

What began with one trampoline centre back 2015 with his business partners Michael Harrison and Simon Whicker – a former senior partner at accountancy giant KPMG whom he met while sailing – has already grown significantly in scale and broadened in ambition.

Jenkinson says: 'The next three to five years is about families and having fun and enjoying the time they've got together. Our mindset has always been that we wanted to be a high street name.

'Other similar companies back then were one-site industrial estate businesses. But we set out from the beginning to look to the future. We knew we wanted five and then ten and kept asking 'what can we do that's different?'

Both he and Michael grew up in the seaside town of Bridlington, not far from where he now lives. His family ran fishing boats and excursions, and even a toy shop.

He says: 'I've known Michael since we were kids. We grew up together. He's from a travelling funfair originally and his family decided to settle in our little seaside town. He's been involved in leisure and hospitality his whole life.'

Jenkinson and his wife had just returned from more than a decade in the Caribbean and America working on private sailing yachts.

'One thing that industry does is create a good work ethic because you can never quite switch off – lots of really good skills that you can utilise in business,' he says. He recounts, on their return: 'Tracy saw an episode of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills – or something like that – and one of their husbands had opened a trampoline Skyzone trampoline franchise.

'She said it could be a fantastic venture, so we talked about it. We knew nothing about any of it but it seemed like quite a good idea.'

Harrison – the operations driver of the business to Jenkinson's legal and financial side – was determined to negotiate their way into top retail and leisure destinations rather than far cheaper alternatives.

'Looking back, that was definitely the right call,' he says, pointing out that has sharpened their competitive edge while also putting them in the right place at the right time as retail retreats.

'The plan was very different to what everyone else was doing. We wanted town centre locations and shopping malls and we questioned that strategy for a long time. Other trampoline parks were getting built out of town and they were paying very cheap rents. But we stuck to our guns, focused more on diversifying as we went and on being best in class – the best standards, cleanliness. We knew in the long term that would allow us to stay profitable when others fell away – which is what has happened.

'We were very fortunate to get a meeting with Land Securities. There was a unit at the back of the Xscape Yorkshire [ski slope] in Castleford they hadn't been able to get to work. A couple of businesses had tried and gone bust so they gave us a shot.'

That was 2014 and the beginnings of a 17,000 square foot trampoline centre. With imported kit – and some help from friends and family – they built it themselves.

'It was incredibly successful from the beginning. We increased footfall, helped support the other tenants – not just with the people we brought in, but the birthday party food delivered by Nando's and Pizza Express. It was good for everybody.'

Offers for more leases quickly followed – not just from Landsec but other major landlords too.

'We became the blue-eyed boys,' he says. As success mounted, so did their ambitions to grow and add new activities.

'We've been generating cash from day one and made nearly £1million [profit before tax and interest payments] in the first year. So we just pumped it all back in and carried on building.'

Now with franchise deals in Germany and Saudi Arabia, the international arm of the business is already up and running. They have just appointed a chairwoman – former YO! Sushi chief executive Vanessa Hall – and drafted in KPMG to help plan and raise strategic investment.

Jenkinson estimates the business will tap around £10million in funds by early next year from debt or investment on top of the cash generated in the business and hefty contributions from landlords – more readily available now than ever before.

The next 15 will include more giant centres like Wandsworth. Eight of those will be 60,000 to 100,000 square feet. Nearly all will be in former retail outlets.

Jenkinson says the new opportunities are not just retail closures, but a different generation with a new perspective on free time and how to spend it.

'It's hard for a pub just to be a pub any more. In Wandsworth, if you want to go and have a drink, we've got two bars, three restaurants and a whole host of other things you can do along the way rather than just stand in a pub. It has its place but business needs to adapt.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The founder of Pret a Manger has warned that restaurant prices are set to rise by more than a fifth because of the soaring cost of staff.

Julian Metcalfe, 61, said the pandemic had brought a 'perfect storm' which made 'massive' wage increases to up to £15 per hour inevitable.

The entrepreneur, who is now chief executive of Itsu, said his shipping costs were four times higher than pre-pandemic.

'Perfect storm': Pubs and restaurants have struggled for staff, leading some to increase wages

Pubs and restaurants have struggled for staff, leading some to increase wages, while a shortage of lorry drivers has also led wages to rise.

In addition, industry leaders have reported a rise in the price of meat and fresh produce of up to a seventh, while beer prices around London have rocketed.

Firms have cut their menus to reduce costs in the kitchen, while others have increased the price of side dishes or alcohol. Seaside towns are facing the toughest price pressures as record demand from staycationers meets a shortage of hospitality workers.

Metcalfe said he expected to push wages for staff up by as much as £5 per hour, equivalent to £9,100 per year, as he opens 24 new restaurants.

He said: 'The cost of labour and ingredients is sky-rocketing. Soon prices in restaurants are going to go up... it could be 20, 30, or 40 per cent.

'Yes of course we're going to have to put up wages massively. It's a perfect storm.

'A McDonald's for two in Zurich is 26 euros (£22), and they still have access to the EU labour pool in Switzerland – we don't. There's no law that says that McDonald's has to sell a cheeseburger for 99p any more, it could be £1.99.'

James Almond, whose family runs four pubs in the North-West, said the recruitment crisis is forcing wages up. He said: 'It's going to cost me more to pour a pint or put a meal on a plate. I would happily charge £8 for your pint of beer if customers would pay.'

The price of some of his wines has gone up by one tenth.

Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: 'There's significant food price and wage inflation.'

Clive Black, of Shore Capital, said: 'Restaurants and hotels have to rebuild their balance sheets and generate cash and make up for the massive loss of earnings over 18 months.'

But prices may be held in check if customers vote with their feet. One analyst said: 'Twenty to 40 per cent is cloud-cuckoo-land. Restaurants are already struggling to compete with ready meals and home cooking.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I am a 64-year-old woman, and when I was younger I took some time off from work to raise my family.

I am now wondering how the time I spent at home will affect my retirement income.

Will the period in which I was looking after my child be counted towards the 35 years of National Insurance contributions I need to get my full state pension? And how does the credits system work?

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Retirement finances: How will my time as a stay-at-home Mum affect my pension?

Steve Webb replies: The way in which your state pension is protected for time at home with children changed in 2010.

I will start by covering your situation as someone yet to retire, but I will also explain the old rules for those who may have been retired for some years, in case they may be missing out, as I am sure some pensioners are.

When protection for time at home with children was first introduced in 1978, it went by the rather old-fashioned name of 'Home Responsibilities Protection' or HRP.

Since 2010, years spent at home have simply been referred to as years of National Insurance credits. HRP years already earned were converted into years of credits for those who were yet to retire.

You now get a year of credits for any complete financial year in which you were getting child benefit for a child aged under 12 (since 2010/11) or under 16 (from 1978/79 to 2009/10). Note that the year in which your child turns 12 or 16 does not count.

Importantly, the child benefit has to be in your name. If the child benefit was in your partner's name, you can apply to get the credits/HRP transferred. However, this only applies to those reaching pension age since 2008.

Since 6 April 2016, you have needed 35 years of full rate NI contributions to get a full new state pension, whilst from 2010/11 to 2015/16 the target was 30 years for a full basic pension under the old system.

A year at home with a young child earns you just as much state pension as a year in a well-paid job

Under the new state pension, a year of NI credits for time at home with a child counts as one full year towards your 35 year target.

A year at home with a young child therefore earns you just as much state pension as a year in a well-paid job.

If you have several children, you can continue to get credits as long as the youngest child is under 12.

Although I have talked about being 'at home' with the children, there is no specific rule about what you are doing during the year in question.

Obviously, if you are working and paying NI contributions then the NI credit is of no value - though it could be transferred to a grandparent in certain cases. But if you are not working or don't earn enough to pay or be credited with NI, then the credit for being a parent is very valuable.

Better-off families could be missing out

One worry at the moment is that growing numbers of better off families may be missing out on these vital credits. Because of the 'high income child benefit charge', some new families have decided simply not to bother claiming child benefit.

But if they don't claim at all, they don't get the NI credits towards their pension. If they don't want the hassle of getting child benefit and then paying a tax bill, they should simply register for 'credits only'.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

It is important to get on with doing this as new claims can only be backdated for three months.

Turning now to people who reached pension age before April 2010, the system worked in a rather different way.

Until 2010, women generally needed 39 years of NI contributions to get a full basic pension. Any years of HRP (for children under 16) were knocked off the 39-year target.

To see how this worked, consider the case of a woman who had 9 years of HRP and 15 years of NI contributions through work.

In this case, the woman's target for a full pension would be reduced from 39 years to 30 years because of the 9 years of HRP.

Her 15 years of contributions would then entitle her to a 50 per cent pension, based on 15/30th of the full rate.

An important point to note is that women who had opted to pay the reduced 'married woman's stamp' did not qualify for HRP for those years.

To be more precise, HRP was not awarded for any year in which such a woman either was paying the reduced stamp or would have been eligible to do so if she had been in work.

In theory, getting NI credits or HRP onto your National Insurance record should be automatic. Your record on the Child Benefit computer is matched to your National Insurance record and credits should appear automatically.

But I have heard from lots of people over the years where this did not happen. If uncorrected, this can mean you don't get all the state pension to which you should be entitled.

Anyone who has missed out on HRP can claim it using Form CF411, and anyone who has missed out on NI credits can claim it using Form CF411a.

If you think this might be you, I would be interested to hear from you, especially if you have full details of why you think you may have missed out.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@This year marks a decade since the launch of the smart meter rollout - but just 43 per cent believe it has been worth it, new research has revealed.

Since being introduced, smart meters have been plagued by reports of malfunctions and delays.

This appears to have influenced thoughts on the devices with 78 per cent of those opposed to smart meters saying it is because they have been a waste of money, according to data from MoneySupermarket.

A further 21 per cent believe the in-home display given alongside meters is out of date and would have preferred an app.

It's been a decade since smart meters launched but many are not sure they're worth having

The comparison site spoke to 2,000 people to gather their opinions of the smart meter rollout on the tenth anniversary of its launch.

It found that, in response to the question 'has your smart meter changed the way you use energy?' 29 per cent of respondents said yes while 28 per cent said they had not.

However, of those in support of smart meters, 67 per cent say it is because they have helped them become more energy conscious whilst 54 per cent believe they have brought an end to estimated bills.

Another 52 per cent say they have encouraged a better understanding of how the energy market operates.

The survey paints a picture of customers conflicted about how worthwhile the meters are.

To find out how successful the rollout has been, This is Money takes a look at how how many people currently have smart meters, what the current government targets are for installation and the problems consumers have had along the way.

What are the smart meters?

Smart meters were introduced by the Government in 2011 as a way of helping households stay in control of their energy bills which in turn could help people keep costs down.

Now they are installed in homes across Britain, to replace the traditional meters including prepay key meters that most people have under the stairs or outside the home.

The devices measure how much gas and electricity you are using as well as what it's costing you and display this on an in-home display.

This means there does not need to be any estimated readings and consumers should only pay what they have used - something that could be more important as a large portion of the population continue to work from home.

Robert Cheesewright, Director at Smart Energy GB, said: 'Britain's smart meter rollout has evolved in the years since it began, with many millions of people choosing to update their meters with new technology.

'By getting smart meters we're taking a small but vital step to tackle the climate crisis, as well as feeling the benefits at home from greater control of our energy use.'

Some say their smart meter has helped them manage their energy bills but others aren't sure

How many have been installed?

Originally, there was a target to offer every house a smart meter by the end of 2020 but this proved unrealistic.

As such, in 2019, Government ministers said suppliers will instead have until 2024 to install the devices in at least 85 per cent of homes.

It introduced 'strict' new yearly installation requirements for suppliers and said they could still receive fines if targets are missed.

As of 31 March 2021, there were 24.2million smart meters installed in homes and small businesses in Britain, according to the latest figures from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

This represented just a five per cent increase compared to the same time the year before.

The rate of installations has slowed dramatically with 760,900 devices fitted in homes in the first three months of this year - 213,900 less than in the last three months of 2020 – a 22 per cent decrease.

However, it is unsurprising that installations were down, as the lockdown was still in place due to the pandemic.

This meant many engineers were not able to get into homes to fit devices.

Many energy experts say smart meters could help contribute to net zero by 2050 but, to do so, installations must pick up.

However, the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has recently admitted that smart meters will become redundant if Britain ditches gas boilers in an effort to go green.

He revealed new smart meters that work on hydrogen boilers - a possible future greener alternative to conventional gas boilers - would have to be installed.

In turn, this would make the multi-billion pound, much-delayed rollout of smart meters largely redundant because they cannot measure the flow of hydrogen.

There was a target to offer every home a meter by the end of 2020 but this proved unrealistic

What problems have there been?

There have been many concerns over the rollout since it launched with lots of households encountering challenges with their first generation devices (SMETS1).

Many were found to have a fault where they stopped working after customers switched suppliers.

Once they lost functionality, they became all but useless with customers having to ask for the existing meter to be removed and a new one to be installed by their new provider.

The second generation meters, SMETS2 devices, were meant to rectify this problem, however, many suppliers are still not installing these and continue to install the SMETS1 models.

Customers have complained that when they have specifically requested a second generation device, they are still receiving a first generation model instead.

This is likely due to an excess of products that suppliers are trying to get rid of.

Others have said suppliers have sent them continuous letters and emails asking them to have one installed - even if they have already stated they are not interested.

The take up, in general, has been considerably less than the Government anticipated meaning the initial target date of every home and small business being offered one has been pushed back multiple times.

Previous research from This is Money also found that, although smart meters are free, many customers could have seen their energy bills go up as a result of the rollout as providers have to pay rent for the devices - a cost which is likely passed on to consumers.

The take up of smart meters has been considerably less than the Government anticipated

What do consumers think?

MoneySupermarket's survey found that of those who said smart meters had not changed the way they used energy, 34 per cent say it is because they didn't see the point in them and 26 per cent said they weren't bothered about their energy use.

Another 19 per cent said they did not understand how to use their smart meter while 18 per cent cited not trusting their smart meter.

However, of those who said smart meters had changed the way they used energy, 73 per cent say it was because they had given them greater control over their energy use whilst 67 per cent said they cared more about reducing their energy use and trying to save money.

Cheesewright said: 'This latest research is clear. Britain backs the rollout, with almost double the amount of people saying that it's been worth the investment, than not.

'Research from Smart Energy GB has also found that over two thirds of those with a smart meter would recommend getting one.

'The rollout has had its challenges but with over 24million smart meters now installed, what has become overwhelmingly clear is how necessary smart meters are for a more affordable, cleaner energy system.'

Justina Miltienyte, energy policy expert at Uswitch, added: 'Smart meters prevent the need for meter readings and provide more accurate bills, opening up the potential for more innovative services for customers.

'The smart meter rollout programme has faced a lot of delays so far, and is taking longer than expected to complete. However, it's important to recognise that smart meters will be key for future innovation in the energy market.

'With the smart meter display, you can also see the direct impact your habits and lifestyle have on your bill.

'This is particularly useful if you have a prepayment meter, so you can better track how your usage impacts your available credit. By making your energy usage easier to understand, you can make smarter decisions to save energy and money, including feeling more confident switching energy supplier.

'The Government's new four-year framework on smart meter installations ends in 2024, so it's clear that this complicated rollout is not going to complete any time soon - and more work is needed to get smart meters in every home across the country.'

Ultimately, however, it seems that consumers may be undecided on the value of smart meters.

It is likely this debate will continue for years to come as the rollout continues with suppliers still pushing customers to have one installed in a bid to meet targets.

But for those who think they might be spending too much on their energy, they are encouraged to use price comparison services to see if they could save by switching provider or moving to a fixed tariff deal.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The vast majority of Britain's medium-sized businesses are in favour of shifting the end of the tax year to 31 December in line with its international peers, a new survey shows.

In most major countries, including the US, France and Germany, the end of the tax year coincides with the end of the calendar year. Ireland also moved its government accounting and tax year end from 5 April to 31 December in 2002.

Last month, the Office for Tax Simplification said it was considering moving the UK’s tax year, currently ending on 5 April, to either 31 March or 31 December.

Tax year end: Most UK firms would rather it coincided with the end of the calendar year

A move which would prove popular among British firms, since over 90 per cent said they would support it, according to a survey of 500 British medium-sized businesses by accounting firm BDO.

However, they said the change would need to be planned carefully with longer filing deadlines to help businesses make the transition.

'Businesses are hoping that a rethink of the tax system can help them flourish following the challenges of Brexit and Covid-19,' said Paul Falvey, tax partner at BDO.

'Changing the tax year to 31 December is supported by businesses of all sizes and will be particularly helpful for those with international connections.'

The UK’s tax year for individuals runs from 6 April to the following 5 April, and it has been like this for hundreds of years.

In contrast, accounting systems used by businesses have been developed around month and quarter ends.

The financial year for the UK government accounting and for companies runs from April 1 to March 31. That - and 31 December - are the two most popular dates for accounting for multinationals.

In June, the OTS said that if they were to make the end of the calendar year coincide with the end of the tax year, the transitional year would be shortened by three months and five days and run from 6 April to the following 31 December.

'Clearly there will be challenges associated with implementing this change, not least for the Government itself,' Falvey said.

'But in the long term, a 31 December year-end would also make life simpler for HMRC.

'Aligning the year-end with more of the international community will help taxpayers to calculate and HMRC to check that the correct amount of tax is paid by those doing business in more than one country.'

Medium sized firms would also like additional tax measures to encourage businesses to grow and scale-up in the UK, according to the survey.

More than half businesses said they would like the 'super deduction' policy introduced by the Chancellor at the Budget in March - which is set to end in March 2023 - to become permanent

Some 53 per cent said they would like the 'super deduction' policy introduced by the Chancellor at the Budget in March - which is set to end in March 2023 - to become permanent.

The super deduction allows companies to claim capital allowances at a 130 per cent rate for money spent on 'qualifying' machinery, meaning companies can cut their tax bill by up to 25p for every £1 they invest.

Businesses would also like further tax incentives introduced, with half saying that the government should introduce better research and development tax breaks for all sizes of business.

'The government has introduced a huge programme of Covid-19 support measures, but as we enjoy a summer with fewer restrictions, we should consider how tax incentives can be improved to inspire UK-based businesses to grow domestically,' Falvey added.

'Making the super deduction policy permanent as well as broadening R&D tax breaks would certainly be a good start to encourage further investment and innovation.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kevin Clifton chatted to the Loose Women on Monday about appearing on Strictly Come Dancing with Stacey Dooley.

When asked whether the two of them got on on the BBC One show the professional dancer, 38, gushed about his documentary maker girlfriend, 34, recalling: 'We got on really well and she put loads of hours in.'

The pair were rumoured to be romantically linked as the series progressed, and eventually became official, and have been living together throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

Comeback: Kevin Clifton, 38, chatted to the Loose Women on Monday about appearing on Strictly Come Dancing with Stacey Dooley, 34, along with a possible judging role on the show and returning to musical theatre

Talking about their time on the show, he continued: 'She realised she was not as good as the others so started doing 8am - 10pm.'

He was asked by Kaye Adams to explain how Stacey 'manifested' his new role as Cosmo in Singin' In The Rain.

He recalled: 'We were watching Singin' In The Rain on Christmas Day and Stace doesn't really know much about musical theatre like I do , it's not really on her radar.'

Throwback: Professional dancer, 38, gushed about his documentary maker girlfriend as he recalled that they 'got on really well'; pictured on the show in 2018

Stacey had apparently told Kevin that he should play the role of Cosmo when there was next have a production of the show.

He said on the show: 'I said, "yeah well I would love to, I'd die to play that role, it's such an iconic role"'

He continued: 'And the Make Em Laugh routine that he does I've watched on YouTube so many times'

He went on to reveal that only a couple of weeks later his agent called him to ask about what he thought of playing the role of Cosmo.

Kevin said that he wasn't sure whether he had got the role but Stacey was apparently 'sure' that he'd got it and that 'it was meant to be.'

New production: He was asked by the panel to explain how Stacey Dooley 'manifested' his new role as Cosmo in Singin' In The Rain

Dream character: He revealed on the show that he told Stacey that he would 'die' for the role of Cosmo

The performer went on to say that he's more appreciative of being on stage now, after the pandemic, and that he began to question what his purpose was when he couldn't get up on stage.

Talking about his appearance he said: ‘I used to worry about things like that, I used to wish I was taller, or I wish I had eight abs. I think as I’ve got older I’ve started feeling more comfortable in my skin.'

On whether he misses the enormous audience at Strictly compared with the smaller crowd on stage he said: 'You only see the studio audience. I loved the show, it’s been a massive part of my life and I still love and there’s still a part of me that says never say never, even going back to it in a different role.'

'If anyone wants to move aside I will happily be a judge on strictly come dancing'

Coincidence? Kevin then revealed that only a couple of weeks later his agent called him to ask about what he thought of playing the role of Cosmo

Hard times: The performer went on to say that he's more appreciative of being on stage now, after the pandemic. He began to question what his purpose was when he couldn't get up on stage

Joking with the panel, he said: 'Maybe Stacey can manifest it for me!'

Kevin is currently taking to the stage as Cosmo Brown alongside Steps star Faye Tozer, 45, who plays Lina Lamont.

The professional dancer performs high-energy routines during the show, which uses more than 14,000 litres of water on stage every night, with the story combining the charm, romance and wit of the 1952 film.

Meanwhile, Stacey is taking new steps in her career also, with the star reportedly set to host a new BBC cookery show, after being 'axed' from her makeover series Glow Up for breaking strict advertisement rules.

The television personality is said to have landed the presenting job for Hungry For It- a series which will search for up-and-coming talent in the culinary world.

It will be a second chance for Stacey, who was reportedly secretly let go from her Glow Up hosting gig after 'furious' BBC bosses discovered she had broken the broadcaster's rules by starring in a beauty ad.

Cute: Kevin said he hasn't ruled out taking up a judging role on Strictly, joking with the panel: 'Maybe Stacey can manifest it for me!'

Wow: Nicole Scherzinger, 43, made sure her week got off to a glamorous start on Monday when she shared a sizzling new series of Instagram selfies debuting shorter hair

Nicole looked beautiful wearing a full face of expertly-applied makeup in the snaps.

The Don't Cha hit-maker's glossy hair appeared a good few inches shorter than usual, and the star flashed her fans a playful wink.

In the second photo shared by Nicole at the beginning of the week, she shot a sultry stare down the camera's lens.

Although this is the first time Nicole has shown off her new shorter hairstyle on social media, the raven-haired beauty was seen rocking the new look after Sunday's taping of The Masked Singer in LA.

Best angles: The Pussycat Doll put on a fierce display for her followers, working her best angles while wearing nothing but a plush white robe

Nicole wrote: 'Savage. Let's get it Monday. New week. New mood. New mana'

The Pussycat Doll left the series' studio wearing a sparkly green dress and show-stopping yellow heels.

She has been involved with The Masked Singer ever since its inception in 2019.

The show is based on the Korean show King of Mask Singer, which initially premiered in 2015.

The performer regularly appears alongside fellow panellists Ken Jeong, Robin Thicke and Jenny McCarthy in all of the episodes, with Nick Cannon serving as a host.

Joel McHale has appeared in every season of the hit Fox show since its inception.

New look: Nicole's hair was looking significantly shorter in the photos shared by her on Monday (pictured in July)

During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Nicole expressed that she was heavily invested in The Masked Singer's success for a very personal reason.

She remarked, 'with doing a lot of these talent-searching shows, I do get very emotional because music is the best way of communication and connection to me'.

The actress also gave the media outlet her take on why the program has become so well-known with audiences and lauded the series' unorthodox take on competition shows.

'I think that's what's so bizarre and so special about our show is that you're looking at these crazy costumes and these faces that don't move. And yet you're moved by these contestants, you're moved by their performances,' she said.

The hit-maker also expressed that she saw The Masked Singer as a way for the performers to let out their deepest feelings without fear of ridicule.

'I feel like with that mask on, it gives them the courage to let go more, but they're really revealing all from the inside out,' she noted.

Nicole concluded by expressing that she was happy to be one of the program's main figures and stated that she enjoyed a close relationship with her collaborators.

'It doesn't even feel like a job. It's the best job in the world. I get to go to work with the panellists, who are my close friends that I adore and love,' she said.

The Justice League action star reportedly began texting the Bronx-born 52-year-old in February before making their rekindled romance public in late April.

'Bennifer' were last seen Wednesday grabbing dinner at West Hollywood hotspot Craig's alongside her 13-year-old daughter Emme (from her third marriage to Marc Anthony).

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anyone who has seen the film The Holiday will have been tempted by the idea of home swapping.

The Christmas romcom sees Iris, played by Kate Winslet, trade an idyllic cottage in Surrey for an LA mansion owned by Amanda (Cameron Diaz) for a two-week holiday of a lifetime.

Now, 15 years after the movie premiered, home swapping is more popular than ever.

City life: Joanna and Kris Fleming had a week-long break with children, Archie, 16, Amelia, 15, and Poppy, 12, staying in a luxury four-bedroom mews house in London’s Notting Hill

The concept is simple. You stay at someone else’s house while they stay at yours — and neither of you pay a penny in accommodation costs.

Ordinarily, British holidaymakers are looking to trade their homes for properties in sunnier destinations at this time of year. But this summer, soaring numbers are seeking exchanges closer to home.

Ever-changing travel advice, costly Covid tests and the risk of having to pay to quarantine in a hotel means many families have been forced to ditch their usual trips abroad.

But with more people opting for a staycation, the cost of holiday accommodation has rocketed.

And with one Suffolk rental costing an eye-watering £107,000 for a week, it’s no wonder families are feeling priced out.

So could house swapping save your summer holiday? Joanna and Kris Fleming certainly think so.

The couple have just returned from a week-long break with their children, Archie, 16, Amelia, 15, and Poppy, 12, where they stayed in a luxury four-bedroom mews house in London’s Notting Hill that would ordinarily cost around £1,000 a night to rent.

But by agreeing to swap their four-bedroom, three-storey house just 50 metres from the beach in St Austell, Cornwall, for the duration, they were able to stay for free.

Kris, 47, who runs a retail business, says: ‘House swapping is an absolute no-brainer when you are tied to taking holidays out of term time when prices rocket. This is particularly true this year with the demand for staycations so high. Swapping homes means we can travel in style.’

By the sea: The Flemings’ four-bedroom, three-storey house just 50 metres from the beach in St Austell, Cornwall

The Flemings enjoyed a fun-packed itinerary during their seven-night stay — lunch at Ronnie Scott’s Soho jazz club, a theatre trip to see The Lion King, a picnic in St James’s Park, shopping at Portobello Market and a day at the Natural History Museum.

Kris adds: ‘We don’t mind spending money on things like theatre tickets and some meals out in smart restaurants when we’re not having to fork out huge amounts for accommodation.’

Families like the Flemings use websites such as HomeLink, Love Home Swap or HomeExchange to arrange swaps.

You pay an annual subscription, typically around £100, for your home to be on the site.

Love Home Swap says it has seen a surge in new members every month this year, recording a 26 pc rise between February and March — around the time the Government announced its roadmap out of lockdown.

And Caroline Connolly at HomeLink adds that travel restrictions mean more people are swapping with other British families this year, rather than owners based abroad.

The key to boosting your chances of being noticed is to compile a clear, friendly description of your home with great photos.

If you find a swap you’re interested in, you just need to ensure your property is left squeaky-clean, clear some space in the wardrobes and lock away any valuables.

But because you are not renting the home, you don’t need to put away all your belongings.

In fact, home swapping is popular among families because it means they don’t need to pack their own toys, bikes and beach equipment.

Alison and Spencer Jago, from Plymouth, estimate they have saved around £2,000 on two holidays via HomeLink so far this year by not having to pay for accommodation.

Alison, 49, says: ‘Our friends often ask how we can afford to go away so often. House swapping means we can travel as much as we have time for without worrying about depleting savings.’

Alison and Spencer, 48, who both work as civil servants, enjoyed a week with their daughter Emily, 12, in a pretty house in a small village just outside Bath during the Easter holidays.

‘We had gorgeous walks on our doorstep and Bath nearby, where we did some shopping.’

During May half-term they stayed in a cottage in a village near Oxford where they could explore the Cotswolds and enjoy a day trip to Henley-on-Thames.

Over the past eight years the Jagos have swapped homes 22 times. Alison estimates they have saved £40,000 on accommodation costs.

‘In all that time there’s only been one occasion where we arrived at a house which wasn’t as clean as I would have liked.

There’s lots of trust involved but you meet some really nice people by swapping. There’s a lot of contact on email and phone with the other family, so you build up trust beforehand.’

The Jagos have previously house swapped with families in France, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Australia and Canada.

‘Going abroad is exciting but this year we’ve really enjoyed exploring parts of the UK that we’ve never visited. The beauty is that people contact you from places you might never have thought to visit. You never know where the next swap will take you.’

Jo and Davey Watkins, from Mumbles in Swansea, have been swapping their home for years. They recently had a family staying in their seaside home, where they live with their four children Polly, 14, Jinks, 12, Tom, eight and Meg, six. Instead of swapping, the Watkins family went to stay with friends in west Wales.

Their home is listed with Love Home Swap, which operates a reward system. You earn points by having people in your home that you can exchange for a swap another time. How many points you earn depends on your property and the length of stay.

Jo, 47, who co-founded website TheHowPeople.com and Davey, 50, an anaesthetist, are saving points for a holiday abroad next year. Jo says: ‘We have our hearts set on a big holiday to Italy with other family members.

'Since we are not sure we could tally up a straight swap, we are allowing lots of families to stay at our home this summer to build up points so we can stay for free.

‘We are lucky we have friends to stay with, as it means we can vacate our house and allow other families to have a well-earned break. And for us it means we’re another step closer to our own trip.

‘It’s been such a difficult time for everyone lately, and there’s a real feelgood factor to knowing another family are having a holiday which doesn’t mean raiding their savings.

'The family we have staying now are from a sleepy village in Hampshire and are so excited just to be somewhere where they can have a pizza delivered to their door.’

While there are enormous savings to be made, there are also some practicalities to consider. You must inform your home insurer and ensure your contents insurance covers accidental damage.

Insurer Direct Line says there may also be other exclusions, such as vandalism. If you do not have a family member or neighbour who can hand over the keys to your visitors, you may need an outdoor lock box where guests can access the keys using a code.

If you experience any problems, report the owners to the website you used — and be sure to check reviews before you book.

And, until you have agreed to a swap, stick to exchanging messages through the website rather than via email or phone.

Most sites will also offer an identity check service to ensure your guests are who they say they are.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@House prices grew at the slowest pace since March last month, but they still picked up by a robust 7.6 per cent year-on-year, new figures by mortgage lender Halifax show.

The average UK home was priced at £261,221 in July, which marks a 0.4 per cent increase from the June, when prices had dipped by 0.6 per cent month-on-month.

Despite the slowdown, prices are only slightly below May's peak of £261,642 and still more than £18,500 higher than a year ago.

Cooling: Halifax said price growth will slow down, but it does not expect any falls this year

Halifax said the cooling in prices was to be expected, given the strong rise seen last summer when the stamp duty holiday was introduced and buyers were returning to the market after the first lockdown.

House price growth is set to keep slowing, Halifax said, but it did not forecast any falls for the rest of the year as the market remains 'solid' while the economy recovers.

Halifax's report contrasts with Nationwide's, which showed house prices dipped 0.5 per cent in July on a monthly basis. However, Nationwide reported a larger annual increase of 10.5 per cent.

'This easing was somewhat expected given the strength of price inflation seen last summer, as the market began its recovery from the first lockdown, and with activity supported by the start of the stamp duty holiday,' said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.

He added: 'Although there remains some uncertainty over the impact on employment from the unwinding of Government support schemes, on balance the risks to the macro-environment are receding, with consumer confidence improving, the labour market recovering, and the economy expanding as restrictions are lifted.

'Overall, assuming a continuation of recent economic trends, we expect the housing market to remain solid over the next few months, with annual price growth continuing to slow but remaining well into positive territory by the end of the year.'

Ups and downs: Annual house prices rose by 7.6 per cent, down from 8.7 per cent in June

As always, the picture across the country varied greatly, with some regions seeing much stronger growth than others.

Prices in Wales rose by the most at 13.8 per cent - the fastest growth in the country since 2005. Meanwhile Yorkshire saw prices rise 11 per cent which was the highest for over 16 years, Halifax said.

At the other end of the spectrum, prices in London rose by a much smaller 2.5 per cent.

Regional prices in July and annual increase East Midlands, £216,663, 9% Eastern England, £304,670, 7.1% London, £511,190, 2.5% North East, £153,235, 7.6% North West, £201,491, 10.4% Northern Ireland, £164,023, 8.9% Scotland, £184,933, 9% South East, £355,973, 7.4% South West, £271,752, 10% Wales, £194,918, 13.8% West Midlands, £221,526, 7.3% Yorkshire and the Humber, £186,321, 11%

The housing market has been booming during the past year, stoked by the stamp duty holiday, low interest rates and rising demand for larger homes due to the pandemic.

However, the stamp duty holiday will come to an end soon.

The 'nil rate' stamp duty band was reduced from £500,000 to £250,000 from July and it will revert to its standard rate of £125,000 in October, meaning many people putting offers in now are likely to miss out on any stamp duty savings.

But Halifax said a lack of supply would continue to push prices up.

'Latest industry figures show instructions for sale are falling and estate agents are experiencing a drop in their available stock,' Galley said.

'This general lack of supply should help to support prices in the near-term, as will the exceptionally low cost of borrowing and continued strong customer demand.'

Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent and a former RICS residential chairman, said: 'After a record-breaking June, the housing market is becoming accustomed to more 'normal' levels of activity but still above what we would reasonably expect at this time of year.

'There is no serious price correction or steep fall in transactions as these figures bear out. Certainly, we are seeing that nearly all sales agreed before the stamp duty concession began to taper off are proceeding and without price renegotiation.

'Available stock remains at low levels and this is continuing to support values, along with cheap mortgage rates.'

Latest industry figures by RICS show instructions for sale are falling and estate agents are experiencing a drop in their available stock

Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said there are 'good reasons' to think that house prices will stay elevated.

'These include government support to household incomes and ultra-low mortgage rates,' he said. 'While the former, notably the furlough scheme, will finish in the autumn, there seems little prospect of interest rates rising until well into next year, even after August’s MPC meeting delivered a more hawkish tone.'

'The pandemic has also had potentially long-lasting effects on property preferences, including a ‘race for space’ as people seek larger homes in a world of more home working. There is plenty of fuel for property deposits provided by the substantial savings accumulated by households during lockdowns.

'Meanwhile job and incomes losses during the pandemic have disproportionately affected younger, lower-paid, people who are generally not in the market to buy a property. So, there are good reasons to think house prices will stay elevated.'

The number of young people making investments has soared during the coronavirus crisis, with many deciding to dabble in the stock market for the first time while spending more time at home under lockdown.

A surge in interest in crypto-currencies played a part in the trend, along with the rise of so-called meme stocks such as Gamestop and AMC, which young investors piled into.

Chris Hill, Hargreaves Lansdown chief executive, said the pandemic had triggered a ‘permanent shift in consumer behaviour’ and that ‘younger people now have a greater appetite for investment’.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's commercial property market can be as much of a soap opera as its residential one.

In recent years it has swung from its post-financial crisis woes, to being firmly on the up, before buckling under the burden of Brexit and fears for the retail sector.

The latest trouble for the sector comes in the world of shopping centres and high streets, where retailers are attempted to negotiate their way out of expensive rents - and in some cases going bust.

Yet, despite the worries, property can remain a profitable place to invest and deliver solid income as part of a portfolio.

Navigating there way through that, investment trusts such as Ediston Property Investment Company, can chunky dividends - 5.5 per cent in its case, although investors must be happy with ongoing charges of 1.7 per cent.

On this episode of the Investing Show, Calum Bruce of Ediston, talks through where the opportunities lie in British commercial property, why retail isn't all bad news and how to invest for the best returns while trimming risk.

He says that property remains an interesting and potentially profitable place to invest part of your portfolio and can deliver a steady stream of income.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The triple lock has always been a hot potato but things have stepped up another gear as it could deliver a bumper 8 per cent state pension increase due to a statistical quirk.

The state pension pledge means that payouts rise by the greatest of inflation, wage growth or 2.5 per cent.

Yet, wage growth numbers are being skewed this year because the Covid crash a year ago saw millions put on furlough on a maximum of 80 per cent of earnings, workers suffer temporary pay cuts, and many lose their jobs.

Job cuts disproportionately hit the low paid and continue to do so, taking them out of the figures and bumping up the average wage, workers coming back from furlough are seeing pay go back up to their full amount, and short-term pay cuts have been reversed.

All this makes average wage growth look artificially high, despite many public and private sector workers suffering pay freezes or negligible rises.

The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that distortion could lead to an 8 per cent wage growth figure in the month the triple lock reading is taken from, delivering a £14 weekly increase to the state pension and £3billion bill.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak will today announce further details of his green finance plans

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Energy bills will rise for millions of households this autumn, with most seeing an increase of £139 a year at a time when many are still facing financial difficulties.

The energy price cap is increasing by £139 to £1,277 for the 11million customers on their suppliers' default tariff, Ofgem announced today.

Bills will also increase by £153 to £1,309 for 4million pre-payment meter customers.

The increased bills will start from 1 October, and last for the following six months until the cap is reviewed again.

Energy bills will rise for millions of households with most seeing an increase of £150 a year

The changes are being blamed on a rise in wholesale energy prices, and energy firms trying to recoup costs after customers missed payments during the pandemic.

Ofgem added surging global fossil fuel prices are already driving up inflation for consumers, making fixed rate energy tariffs not covered by the price cap, as well as petrol and diesel more expensive.

The price cap was already standing at £1,138, after rising by £96 a year in April.

This is Money previously reported that the price level was likely to soar by as much as £150 at the next review, according to energy experts at Energy Helpline, due to a rise in energy costs.

The cap was launched in 2019 to stop providers charging rip-off prices to households that do not switch every year.

It is reviewed twice a year to reflect the costs of supplying electricity and gas for suppliers.

However, many suppliers price their tariffs right up to the limit and have been accused of treating the cap as a target.

The hike will come as a significant blow to many, as energy prices reach their highest level in years.

In fact, suppliers have upped the cheapest energy deals by £180 in a year, research from Compare the Market found.

As a result, customers on pricey default tariffs and those who think they are paying too much are encouraged to use price comparison sites to see if they could save by switching or moving to a fixed deal.

The hike will come as a significant blow to many as energy prices reach highest level in years

These are typically much better value that the default options as the prices are frozen and cannot rise for the length of the contract.

Customers could pay nearly £250 less than the new £1,277 cap per year, if they switched to one of the top ten best-buy deals (see below).

Justina Miltienyte, energy policy expert at Uswitch, said: 'The price cap rise is the ultimate triple blow for homes across the country.

'Not only is it the first time Ofgem has raised the cap twice in a year, it's also the first time the cap has gone up before winter and the highest increase since the cap was first introduced back in 2019.

'This should be a real wake up call to consumers that the price cap will not protect them from skyrocketing bills.

'Unfortunately, the writing was on the wall for the cap to go up again, following the continued rise of wholesale prices this year. Prices collapsed in 2020 due to low demand during lockdown, but energy usage has dramatically bounced back.

'Households on standard variable tariffs have faced continued uncertainty over bills, with prices rising and falling as the price cap pendulum has swung to and fro every six months. But this time, it's less of a pendulum and more of a pummelling.'

Whilst many energy experts have criticised the price cap for hiking bills for millions, other firms have praised Ofgem for its introduction, saying that without it some customers would be paying bills hundreds of pounds higher.

Greg Jackson, CEO and founder of Octopus Energy, said: 'The price cap is the single most effective intervention for energy customers.

'It's like the minimum wage - it guarantees a level of decency for everyone, but of course they can still do better if they shop around.

'Global gas prices have tripled in the last year, so without the price cap, energy prices would be hundreds of pounds higher than they are now. Never has the cap been more vital and it should be made permanent.'

Best energy deals on the market

This is Money, with help from Compare the Market, has compiled the best energy deals currently on the market.

All but two are fixed deals, as these are usually better value compared to standard default tariffs.

New supplier, Eon Next, offers the cheapest deal on its Next Exclusive v2 contract.

Customers will be signed up for a year for an average of £942.10, with no exit fee.

The second best deal is with Ebico Living on its Ebico Standard April 2021 v1 variable deal costing £1,032.21 a year.

Meanwhile, challenger supplier, Avro Energy, offers the cheapest deal on its Simple and Flow12M contract.

Customers will be signed up for a year for an average of £1,035.53, with no exit fee.

However, it is not a green tariff - which may be a deal-breaker for homes looking to be more environmentally friendly.

Here, Holly Thomas shares top tips for bagging bargain family fun.

Adventure: Alffi and Lili Jones at the Llanelli Wetland Centre

DISCOUNT DAY TRIPS

Buying tickets for local attractions in advance almost always works out cheaper. For example, an online ticket for Legoland Windsor costs £29 compared with £53 on arrival.

Using a Tesco Clubcard or Nectar points to buy tickets can bring down the price further. When spent on a day out at one of 150 attractions, every 50p in Clubcard vouchers is worth £1.50.

For Legoland Windsor, that means a one-day entry pass could cost just £11.50 in vouchers - less than half the online price.

Websites such as vouchercodes.co.uk, and hotukdeals.com also list discount codes for big attractions.

Try discount website picniq.com for offers such as up to 23pc off tickets to Chessington World of Adventures.

EAT OUT FOR LESS

A host of pubs and restaurants are offering cheap or even free meals for children this summer. At Hungry Horse pubs, children can eat for free between 8am and 12pm, as long as an adult breakfast is also ordered.

While at Sizzling Pubs & Grill youngsters eat for just £1 from Monday to Friday, between 3pm and 7pm, with the purchase of every adult main meal.

Farmhouse Inns is offering a similar deal, though you can eat at any time of day, Monday to Friday. And restaurants without promotions can still be affordable; at Bella Italia the children’s menu starts at £5.99.

FUN ON THE FARM

Pick-your-own-fruit farms make for a wholesome day out. Strawberries are the most common fruit to pick, but apples, gooseberries, rhubarb and blueberries, as well as vegetables such as sweetcorn and courgettes, are also up for grabs. Anything you want to take home is charged by weight.

Entry is usually free or just a few pounds, but there is typically a minimum spend of around £4. Farms often provide containers, but to save on plastic, you could bring your own.

Many places also put on extra activities for children, such as adventure playgrounds and nature trails. Visit pickyourownfarms.org.uk and pyo.co.uk to take a look at the different options.

MOVIE NIGHTS

Odeon Cinema is running Odeon Kids screenings all summer, with tickets priced from £2.50. Check online (odeon.co.uk) for showings at your local cinema. There are also Mini Mornings from £2.49 per ticket at your local Vue cinema (myvue.com).

At Vue cinemas there are Mini Mornings that start from £2.49 per ticket

HALF-PRICE SHOWS

Theatre lovers should make sure they are signed up to receive updates and offers during Kids Week, an annual promotion throughout August where an adult and child (aged 17 or under) can get half-price tickets to shows.

You can book up to eight tickets, with no more than four adults. Four or more children must be accompanied by at least two adults. Visit officiallondontheatre.com/kids-week and choose from a wide variety of London musicals, plays, comedies and children’s shows.

An annual pass is just the ticket NHS workers Catrin and Neil Jones, of Carmarthenshire, Wales, have bought several year-long memberships so they can fill the summer with fun days out with their children, Lili, seven, and Alffi, four. Catrin says: ‘We have no plans to go abroad any time soon, so we decided to make sure we explore as much of the UK as we can, starting on our own doorstep.’ Their most recent purchase was a family pass to the Llanelli Wetland Centre, just 30 minutes from their home. Family membership starts at £72. ‘We only have to go four times to make the pass worth it — we’ve already been three times,’ Catrin says. The pair, both 39, also have annual passes for the The National Botanic Garden of Wales, the National Trust and Cadw, which manages 130 historic properties. They have been documenting their trips on YouTube and social media under the name Silver Nugget Adventure.

SIGN UP TO SAVE

If you live near to National Trust properties or a local zoo and can visit regularly, then an annual membership can work out much cheaper than daily tickets. An annual pass to Longleat Safari Park costs £100 for customers aged 16 to 59, and £75 for children aged between three and 15. If you’re over 60 it’s £90.

With a one-day ticket costing £34.95 for adults and £26.20 for kids, you need to visit only three times a year to benefit. A National Art Pass gives you free entry to hundreds of museums and galleries, plus 50 pc off major exhibitions. Passes cost £73, or £45 if you’re under 30, and £10 for under-16s (artfund.org).

FAB FREEBIES

The Canal & River Trust (canalrivertrust.org.uk) is offering free fishing taster sessions for those who want to learn.

Customers who ditched expensive default or standard variable tariffs in favour of the cheapest on the market could cut their bills by £103 last month.

It was the smallest difference in savings since 2012, energy watchdog Ofgem found.

Last year the cheapest deal cost £338 less than the average default tariff, down from £400 in 2019.

Households can save just a third of what they could a year ago by switching energy supplier

The findings come as Ofgem prepares to raise its price cap, hiking bills by £150 for 15million households.

Avro Energy's Simple and Flow 12-month tariff was the cheapest on the market at £1,035 a year in July, according to comparison site GoCompare.

In the same month in 2020, the cheapest fixed deal was £788 with Outfox The Market.

The current price cap, which limits how much firms can charge customers on standard variable tariffs, is £1,138 a year, based on average usage.

This is expected to rise to £1,288 from October as wholesale prices soar.

Experts are also seeing more fixed-rate energy deals topping the price cap.

Karin Sode, managing director of People's Energy, says: 'No energy supplier can keep their tariffs low any more without them being loss-making.

'Energy suppliers have no choice but to have higher tariffs to cover the costs associated with buying the energy.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Workers who start paying into a workplace pension in their twenties are likely to save themselves hundreds of pounds a month in their thirties thanks to the power of compounded returns, new research suggests.

Compounding refers to the way your investments multiply over time because you earn a return on both your original investment and on the growth in that investment.

A single person wanting to retire at 55 on £13,000 a year on top of state pension would need to put aside £496 a month if they started paying into a pension at 25, according to analysis by robo-adviser Nutmeg.

Pension saving: Workers who start paying into a workplace pension in their twenties are likely to save themselves hundreds of pounds a month in their thirties

But if they delayed by just five years to when they are 30, they'd need to pay in an extra £133 per month, for a total of £629, while if they delayed a whole decade, this rockets to £830 per month.

These calculations do not include state pension, are adjusted to inflation and based on the assumption of a middle-range 5 per cent annual return on your investments, Nutmeg said.

But an income of £13,000 a year may not be enough - recent research revealed that couples typically need £26,000 and single people need £19,000 a year for a comfortable retirement.

This amount would cover essential bills plus regular short haul holidays, leisure activities, alcohol and charity giving.

So, to have a more comfortable retirement income of £19,000 per year, a 25-year-old would need to save £716 per month, rising to an eyewatering £1,200 if they delayed until 35 and still wanted to stop working at 55, according to research.

How does compounding work? Imagine you put £100 in a savings account and you earn 10 per cent interest on that money. After one year your account will hold £110 (£10 of interest plus £100 capital, or 0.1 x 100 = £10 + £100). Now imagine that you leave the accumulated capital in the account and it again earns 10 per cent interest. By the end of the second year you will have £121 (£11 of interest plus £110 of starting capital, or 0.1 x 110 = £11 + £110). By the end of the third year you will have £133.10 (£12.10 of interest plus £121 of starting capital, or 0.1 x 121 = £12.10 + £121). So, the amount of interest grows because the same percentage is applied to a greater starting amount.

Similarly, a couple that started saving at 25 would need to put a combined sum of £972 away every month to retire at 55 on a £26,000 income. This rises to £1,630 if they delay until they are 35.

Waiting to retire until 65, which is the current average retirement age in the UK, takes the pressure off the contributions.

A 25-year-old would need to save a smaller £479 per month to generate a £19,000 annual income, rising to £716 if they started at 35.

But if

Annabelle Williams, personal finance specialist, Nutmeg, said: 'When things are tight, opting out of pension payments can seem like an easy decision to make.

'However, the later you start building up your pension, the harder it is to catch up later in life and the more you’ll have to be putting away when you’re older.

'This is because you will have missed out on all those years of hopefully good investment performance and the power of compound growth, which is when your investment performance comes on top of previous returns.'

She also said that when contributing to your workplace pension, you'll also benefit from employer contributions.

In general, under auto-enrolment the minimum contribution is 8 per cent - 3 per cent of free cash from your employer, 1 per cent from Government tax relief and the other 4 per cent taken directly from your paycheck.

Some employers go above and beyond those requirements, particularly larger companies. Staff at FTSE 100 firms enjoy average contributions from their employer of 8.7 per cent.

Although 8 per cent is the auto enrolment minimum, financial experts tend to recommend you try to save a total of 12 per cent of your salary if you want a comfortable retirement.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Bank of England is likely to be the first major central bank to start raising interest rates – with hikes on the cards as early as mid-2022, HSBC has predicted.

Policymakers on Threadneedle Street were initially only expected to start lifting the bank rate from its record low of 0.1 per cent in late 2023 or early 2024.

But the spectre of soaring inflation is likely to push that decision forward, HSBC thinks, as the central bank tries to keep a lid on the rising cost of living.

The Bank of England is likely to be the first major central bank to start raising interest rates – with hikes on the cards as early as mid-2022, HSBC has predicted

As the bank released its half-year results, chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson said he thought it was possible the Bank of England’s base interest rate could start moving higher from the middle of 2022.

While higher interest rates would be bad for borrowers, they would be welcomed by long-suffering savers – and banks, which have been unable to make much money on the cash they lend out.

The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.1 per cent last year, in response to the pandemic. It hoped to encourage cash-strapped businesses to borrow cheaply, and push households and firms to spend rather than save as the economy stuttered.

But a debate is now raging within the central bank over when would be the best time to start lifting rates again. Some members of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee are worried that hiking rates too early could dampen the economic recovery.

But others fear that inflation, or rising prices, could spiral out of control if stimulus is left in place for too long. In its latest forecasts, thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said inflation could hit 3.9 per cent early next year – almost double the Bank of England’s target.

The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.1% last year

It added that this should fall back to 2 per cent the year after if the Bank started hiking rates, and advised the MPC to ‘prepare the ground for normalising its monetary policy stance’.

HSBC’s rate hike prediction came as the lender reported a surge in profits for the first half of 2021. It raked in £7.8 billion over the first six months of the year, compared to £3.1 billion a year earlier.

Last year HSBC squirreled away £4.4 billion to cover loans expected to turn sour – but it released £517 million of that during the first half, as the economy recovered better than expected. This was particularly the case in the UK, where HSBC has its headquarters.

‘The UK economy has rebounded strongly,’ said chief executive Noel Quinn. HSBC brought back its dividend after the lifting of Bank of England restrictions last month, announcing a 5p-pershare payout totalling £1 billion. The bank gave its bankers a pat on the back too, increasing their bonus pool by 50 per cent to £647 million. It will keep adding to this pile over the year before it pays out the sums next spring.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cyber security, protecting firms and citizens, is both necessary and controversial. Barely a day passes without grim tales of digital extortion.

Poly Network, which links digital ledgers across the globe, says hackers looted some £432million of cryptocurrency.

Israel’s NSO Group provided cyber security software to autocratic clients who promptly used it to snoop on opponents and world leaders.

Cyber spree: Poly Network, which links digital ledgers across the globe, has just revealed that hackers looted some £432bn of cryptocurrency

The boom in cyber abuse explains why London-quoted, Prague-based Avast has fallen into the hands of Arizona competitor Norton for up to £6.2billion.

As one of the few cyber firms quoted in London, Avast has attracted a big institutional following.

Unlike Britain’s undervalued aerospace and defence companies, Meggitt and Ultra, the cyber firm sells at a premium to its counterparts on Nasdaq.

When cyber software group Darktrace did an initial public offering this year there was scepticism because it was backed by Mike Lynch, currently fighting extradition to the US over fraudulent accounting allegations.

Investors who backed Darktrace have been rewarded, with the shares spurting from 330p to 617p in latest trading, placing a market value of £4.3billion on the enterprise.

At its core, Avast is a Czech rather than a UK enterprise, so it is hard to criticise the merger with Norton on security grounds.

UK funds which enthusiastically embraced Avast might have a beef. There is almost no premium involved in the transaction.

Contrast this with the bidding war for aerospace group Meggitt, where the premium is above 70 per cent.

The industrial case for the deal is stronger than the financial justification. Together, the two companies will have 500m-plus users focused on cyber safety.

Microsoft is a big customer for Avast software. But the Silicon Valley giants increasingly are building their own cyber defences into products.

As time marches on they are as likely to be competitors rather than customers, so scale provided by a Norton-Avast combination would be useful.

The deal is described as a ‘merger’ but in effect it is a takeover, with Avast shareholders being offered Norton cash and paper.

Avast chief executive Ondrej Vlcek will be president, working alongside his opposite number Vincent Pilette at Norton. Such doubling up of roles rarely works for long. In an age when big battalion investors have become used to FTSE premiums, the weak takeout price could well trigger a revolt.

Raw deal

Nigel Rudd is among the great City dealmakers. In his early years at Williams Holdings it was all about buying companies at the best price.

Latterly, he has earned the sobriquet ‘Sir Sell-off’ for his skill in disposing of solid British enterprises such as Pilkington, Boots and Invensys at fancy prices.

It looked as if he was onto a sure-fire winner when he agreed to take the American shilling and sell Meggitt to Parker-Hannifin.

The shares’ 70 per cent premium appeared hard to better and Parker, which already has similar sized operations in Britain, is a respected Rolls-Royce supplier.

Broader implications of loss of UK intellectual property, skills and R&D, the impact on national security and the potential for vanishing corporation tax are skimmed over.

Rudd and the other independent directors at Meggitt have been too clever for their own good. They jumped in Parker’s direction without even considering whether there might be a better deal.

Along comes Transdigm, which proclaims a private equity business model, to interfere, offering a 900p a share – an extra pound. Meggitt’s board says the Parker offer remains ‘an attractive’ proposition.

The reality is that a different chairman to Rudd might have kept Parker at a distance and gone it alone. Now the board risks being hoist on its own fiduciary petard.

All’s Wells

Mike Wells has done a good job in breaking up the Prudential.

But it is not done just yet. The latest earnings are more than wiped out by a chunky £5.4billion goodwill writedown at US offshoot Jackson Life, which is being spun out.

The Pru also plans a capital-raising of up to £2.2billion as it continues its exciting Asian expansion. Canadian-born he may be, but chief executive Wells appreciates the virtue of a trusted British brand.

At a time of geopolitical uncertainty in Hong Kong and China, he also recognises the value of a City HQ and quote.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ladbrokes owner Entain has more than quadrupled its profits thanks to higher levels of online betting and a full sporting calendar that included the Euro 2020 football tournament.

Profits climbed to £90.9million in the first six months of 2021, compared to £22.4million in the same period last year, as strong digital trading helped offset the damaging effects of store closures on retail sales.

The company even said the longer-than-expected length of lockdown restrictions bolstered its online business, as sport continued while people were told to stay home, and net gaming revenues shot up by over a quarter to £1.59billion.

Sporting occasion: Events like the Aintree Grand National, Euro 2020 and Cheltenham Festival helped Entain's net gaming revenues shot up by over a quarter to £1.59billion

Its UK business benefited from the hosting of sporting events that were cancelled last year, such as the Aintree Grand National, as well as new product releases like the Ladbrokes 5-a-side betting game.

But it also said its new acquisitions, Bet-pt in Portugal and Baltics-based Enlabs, performed very well, as did its Australian division which hired Hollywood star Mark Wahlberg to front an advertising campaign

However, the Foxy Bingo operator was severely impacted in Germany by new taxes and regulations on sports licences to combat problem gambling, and its NGR in the country fell by about a third.

Entain shares closed trading 1.2 per cent lower at 1,942.5p on Thursday.

By contrast, Entain's joint venture in the United States, BetMGM, continued to benefit from the growing deregulation of sports gambling in the country following the US Supreme Court's decision three years ago to overturn a law that effectively outlawed such an activity.

Having launched sports betting into three more states, Virginia, Iowa and Michigan, BetMGM is now in 13 states compared with three at the beginning of 2020 and expects to be in a total of 20 within the next 12 months.

The college basketball tournament March Madness earned the joint venture a record amount of new customers during the first quarter, and it commands a 30 per cent share of iGaming in the US.

American giant: Entain's joint US venture, BetMGM, launched sports betting in three more states and now has the second-largest market share in sports betting and iGaming the US

In comparison, overall retail revenues plummeted by 46 per cent to £191.3million, with the worst decline happening in Italy where it dived by 90 per cent, while it also fell by around two-thirds in the Republic of Ireland and Belgium.

All its establishments have reopened, though, and since restrictions have been loosened in the UK, volumes have returned to 90 per cent of their pre-pandemic levels.

Chief executive Jette Nygaard-Andersen stated the 'quality and diversification of our businesses has enabled us to deliver our 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit online growth, while also making excellent progress on our strategic priorities.

'This performance is not only a result of our industry-leading technology, but also the hard work and dedication of our talented teams of people around the world, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them.'

Closures: Lockdown restrictions that forced Entain to close its stores for part of the period caused its retail revenues to plummet by 46 per cent to £191.3million

The FTSE 100 business, which also owns Coral and online brand Sportingbet, forecasts full-year underlying earnings will come in at between £850million and £900million because of the impressive results.

In spite of this, Entain is not paying an interim dividend and does not expect to start rewarding investors until its full-year results are published in March next year, assuming that Covid-19 restrictions further loosen.

Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'Ultimately the results from Entain took a positive tone, but easier comparisons from 2020 when sports were on hold added wind to Entain's sails.

'The group looks to be on solid footing, but as the stock is currently priced to perfection, we'll need more evidence to be fully convinced.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Senior's board received a vote of confidence as analysts said it had made the right call to turn down a string of takeover offers.

The FTSE 250 aerospace and defence group has been one of the few companies approached by private equity to stand its ground and refuse to accept a deal.

It turned down a whopping five proposed bids from Texas-based Lone Star, the last of which valued the company at £840million, or 200p per share.

FTSE 250 aerospace and defence group Senior has been one of the few companies approached by private equity to stand its ground and refuse to accept a deal

But calculations from Peel Hunt brokers estimate Boeing-supplier Senior could be worth as much as 303p per share – equal to £1.27billion – if it was bought by another aerospace company.

Senior would be worth the extra money if it was bought by a ‘trade buyer’ rather than a financial firm such as private equity because the merged companies would probably be able to save costs in a number of areas and increase sales.

Mid-cap companies in the sector have been hot property for overseas buyers in the last two years.

Stock Watch - Powerhouse Energy Group Powerhouse Energy Group surged after it bought a stake in an engineering consultancy co-founded and run by its chief technical officer Paul Emmitt. Powerhouse – which specialises in converting plastic waste into hydrogen – bought 48pc of Engsolve for just under £100,000. The two companies have worked together for around four years and Powerhouse said the tie-up would ensure Bridgend-based Engsolve would keep supporting its projects. Engsolve’s turnover was around £840,000 in the year to March. AIM-listed Powerhouse closed up 15.1 per cent, or 0.55p, to 4.2p.

Cobham was swept up last year by private equity group Advent International, which is also trying to buy Ultra Electronics (up 2.2 per cent, or 66p, to 3086p) and Meggitt (down 1.5 per cent, or 12p, to 818p) is being wooed by two bidders.

Peel Hunt analysts said: ‘In our view, this means that the remaining UK aerospace and defence stocks, which include Senior, Chemring and Qinetiq, offer somewhat of a scarcity value and demand is clearly evident for undervalued aerospace assets.’

Peel Hunt’s conclusions give weight to comments from Senior boss David Squires, who maintained throughout the process that Lone Star’s approaches ‘fundamentally undervalued’ the company, which has been hit by the aerospace downturn this year.

Earlier this month, Senior managed to turn a profit and said there were ‘clear signs of recovery’ on the way.

Senior shares rose 4.2 per cent, or 7.2p, to 180.7p last night, while FTSE 250 peers Chemring rose 0.2 per cent, or 0.5p, to 330p and Qinetiq by 0.2 per cent, or 0.8p, to 338p. The mid-cap index fell, however, by 0.04 per cent, or 10.06 points, to 23746.77.

The FTSE 100 was also in the red, down 0.4 per cent, or 26.91 points, at 7193.23 as miners and energy giants fell.

The moves came as the The International Energy Agency cut its forecasts for global oil demand ‘sharply’ for the rest of this year as the delta variant spreads.

The outlook is a sharp reversal for the agency, which was urging Opec to increase production just last month.

The analysis also jars with Wednesday’s call from the US – the IEA’s most influential member – for Opec and its allies to ramp production up faster.

As a result Shell lost 1.8 per cent, or 27.2p, to 1454.2p and BP was off 1.5 per cent, or 4.75p, at 306.95p.

In the second tier, and Tui shares were down 1.1 per cent, or 3.5p, to 329p despite signs that the pandemic travel recovery is fully under way.

Tui bookings have jumped by 1.5m since May, primarily driven by bookings from continental Europe. But the holiday firm’s boss said frequent UK rule changes had deterred people.

Friedrich Joussen pointed to the UK’s decision to add Portugal to the list of green travel destinations in mid-May before removing it in early June. ‘When you change the programme so often, then people cancel,’ he added.

Another steep faller was retailer McColl’s after the company warned on profits, blaming a shortage of delivery drivers.

A company spokesman said: ‘Revenues have been impacted by availability issues in stores over recent months due to supply chain disruption. This has been caused by the widely publicised nationwide shortage of delivery drivers due to a combination of external factors.’

Shares tumbled 25.5 per cent, or 7.4p, to 21.6p.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In recent weeks, our family moved to a larger home, within the same small village and just two minutes from our previous two bedroom apartment.

We have undertaken all the usual things you do when moving including mail redirection, electoral roll registration, renewing driving licences, adjusting insurance policies.

However, I discovered that my insurer would no longer offer cover. They stated my policy would be cancelled with zero refund and four months to go on the term.

It seems quite incredible that I must now declare, when applying for new cover, that my car insurance was previously cancelled. What can I do?

One motorist had his insurance cancelled after moving home - with no explanation given

Grace Gausden, This is Money, replies: There are many reasons why an insurer decides to cancel, refuse or void your car insurance policy.

Common reasons include non-payment, non-disclosure and fraud.

In this instance, we decided not to name the insurer.

However, you are still not sure why your policy was cancelled as your husband's was changed with minimum fuss.

You suspect it may be that crime rates are slightly higher in your new area but it shouldn't be a marked change as you moved only a couple of minutes away from your old property.

Not only are you now questioning how the insurance industry can penalise those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in this situation but also worrying that this means you will be punished moving forward for having a policy cancelled.

As you say, this is a different situation to a policy being cancelled due to a serious infraction.

Insurance cancellation is something drivers have to declare with every new insurance provider.

Unfortunately, this often serves as a red flag and as a result, you may find premiums are much higher or that mainstream insurance suppliers may not want to cover you at all.

This is Money asked insurers what drivers in your situation can do as you feel it is unfair you are made to suffer despite not doing anything wrong.

Many said without knowing the exact circumstances it would be difficult to comment but did offer advice whilst others said what their policy is on premiums being cancelled without warning.

A spokesperson for Admiral said: 'All insurance companies will have their own underwriting criteria and decide what risks they are willing to provide cover for.

'If the customer's last insurer cancelled his policy because they couldn't offer cover for the new address, then we wouldn't expect a customer to declare this.

'If this was the case, then the policy was cancelled due to the underwriting conditions set by the insurance company.

'There are some occasions when we would require a customer to declare why they've had insurance cancelled, for example if it was cancelled due to non-payment or a breach of the terms of the policy.'

Each insurer has their own underwriting criteria which could leave customers with no cover

A spokesperson for Direct Line replied: 'We review every policy on an individual basis and if a customer's circumstances change, then we encourage them to contact us as soon as possible to ensure that their policy is reflective of both their needs and their correct information.

'There are a number of rating factors that are considered when offering a policy to a customer, which is why it is important that a customer makes us aware of any changes as soon as they are aware of them.

'It's important that the customer checks with their insurer as to the reasons why the policy was cancelled and whether this is going to affect them with future quotes. Although in some cases, should a customer's policy get cancelled then this would need to be notified.'

Meanwhile, Compare the Market said you will need to disclose the policy cancellation within the relevant question in most insurance question sets.

It added many insurers would likely not provide a quote, and those who do may charge a higher price.

If you think your car insurance was cancelled wrongly or unfairly, you can make a complaint to the insurer - or at the least gain a final reason for cancellation ahead of doing that.

Ryan Fulthorpe, of GoCompare car insurance, said: 'Insurers take in many factors when deciding whether they can insure a driver and address is a major part of that.

'Some insurers may not want to cover certain postcodes at all, and that's when some drivers can come up against issues.

'By law you have to update a change of address with the DVLA or you could be liable for a £1,000 fine, while not updating your address with your car insurer could invalidate your insurance so it is very important to always give accurate information to your insurer and the DVLA.

'But doing so could mean an increase or a drop in the cost of your car insurance, or in this reader's case, a rejection of the policy.

'Different insurers look at the risk factors of car insurance in a different way, so it's important to shop around for your car insurance to ensure best policy and best price – even when you move house.

'Drivers must always take reasonable care to disclose all relevant information when applying for insurance, otherwise this could lead to a declined claim or a cancelled policy.'

A spokesperson for Aviva added: 'We consider a wide range of risk factors when calculating motor insurance premiums, including the driving experience of the customer, the usage of the vehicle and the address at which the vehicle is kept or where it is usually parked when not in use – for example, in a garage, on a driveway or on the road outside the property.

'The latter point allows us to assess the likelihood of incidents such as theft or malicious damage when the vehicle is not in use.

'If a customer moves house, the level of risk associated with the vehicle may change.

'This could mean that the motor premium may fall or rise in line with this altered risk, or in a very small number of cases, we may no longer be able to offer cover at a new address.

'In this scenario, we would continue cover until the date of the move, but we would inform the customer that we would no longer be able to insure the vehicle after the move has taken place.'

Where drivers park their car & which area they live in can depend on whether they get insured

A spokesperson for Hastings Direct said: 'The stance on what constitutes a cancelled policy for declaration purposes will vary by insurance provider.

'In this particular example, Hastings Direct would not deem cancellation of a customer's previous insurance due to the insurer not covering a new address as a declarable reason of cancellation.

'Generally speaking, insurers are more concerned with situations where customers have had insurance cancelled due to fraud or not adhering to policy terms.

'As such, individual assessment so that they can consider the circumstances behind the cancellation is key to an insurance provider making an informed and fair decision on whether to provide cover.'

Grace Gausden, This is Money, adds: For drivers who believe their policy has been cancelled unfairly, they can complain to their insurer and set out their reasons why.

If you don't reach a satisfactory resolution, you can always take your case to the Financial Ombudsman who will review the evidence and make a judgment.

Lamborghini's iconic eighties poster supercar, the Countach, has been reborn for 2021 with a modern twist on the famed wedge-shape and a hybrid power unit producing a massive 803bhp.

The new Countach LPI 800-4 has been revealed at Monterey Car Week at Pebble Beach, California, and is a futuristic homage to the original car that first saw the light of day - in concept form - 50 years ago.

It is powered by the same hybrid system as the Italian car maker's limited-edition Sián hypercar, using the 6.5-litre V12 engine and supercapacitor technology to boost performance and efficiency.

The stunning retro-inspired two-seater will hit 62mph in 2.8 seconds and has a top speed of 221mph. Prices start from around £2million.

Countach on the comeback trail: Lamborghini has resurrected one of its most iconic names with a modern tribute to the eighties pin-up supercar

Only 112 examples will be built at the Italian marque's Sant'Agata Bolognese factory.

But don't log into your online banking or start rustling through the drawers to find your chequebook just yet, because they're already sold out.

Lamborghini has for weeks been sneaking details of the all-new Countach to existing customers, via its exclusive app - and all 112 have been snapped up by eager enthusiasts desperate to get their hands on the returning legend.

Its full name - LPI 800-4 - denotes the incredible performance figures of the new Countach.

'LPI' is short for 'Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido', which loosely translates to it having a longitudinally mounted engine positioned in the middle - though towards the rear - of the car with a hybrid system. The '800' figure is a reference to it having in excess of 800bhp and the '4' represents the fact it is all-wheel drive.

An icon returns: It has been half a century since the original Countach sent tongues wagging. In 2021, Lamborghini aims to achieve the same result with this, the new LPI 800-4

‹ Slide me › Look familiar? The iconic wedge shape, bulking shoulder vents and triangular slashes in the doors have all been carried over from the original Countach to the new LPI 800-4 version

Lamborghini says the new limited edition car 'pays homage to the Countach's iconic status as a revolutionary design and technology rulebreaker, recreated for the 21st century'.

It will be one of the final high-performance road cars launched by the brand with a monumental V12 engine - and also the last to have supercapacitor technology.

This is unique from a traditional hybrid vehicle with a supplementary battery, with the supercapacitor acting as an electrical component that stores energy that can offer a kick of performance to an already mind-bogglingly potent supercar.

As drama goes, the new Countach has it in droves. It's just a shame a little over 100 examples are going to be produced

Low, long, wedge-shaped and with a long tapered bonnet - the Countach certainly fits the mould of the original supercar

The new Countach will be part of a swansong for the brand's monumental V12 engine - and also the last to have supercapacitor technology, which debuted in another limited edition model in 2019

While many will argue that it could never live up to the 'poster car' reputation the original had, there's no doubting the new version shares lots of DNA with the Countach that many petrolheads would dream about

The V12 petrol engine produces a total of 769bhp alone, while the 48-volt electric motor delivering power from the supercapacitor adds another 34bhp to the equation.

Not only does this translate to a zero-to-62mph sprint time of less than three seconds, it will hit 124mph in 8.6 seconds and continue accelerating beyond the magical 200mph mark.

The car features a monocoque chassis and all the body panels are in carbon fibre to keep weight down and retain as much torsional stiffness. Lamborghini says it tips the scales - dry - at 1,595kg.

'The engineering team that developed the original Countach advanced Lamborghini’s pioneering technical approach, delivering unexpected innovations and the best performance available in a production car,' explains Lamborghini chief technology officer, Maurizio Reggiani.

'That spirit inherently drives Lamborghini R&D, resulting in the pioneering hybrid technology in the LPI 800-4, and the emotive driving experience and top-line performance expected from a flagship V12 Lamborghini.'

Only 112 examples of the 2021 model will be built at the Italian marque's Sant'Agata Bolognese factory. Lamborghini originally built just under 2,000 Countach models over a 16-year production series running from 1974 to 1990

Design inspirations from the original Countach

In terms of design, Lamborghini says the LPI 800-4 is 'instantly recognisable as the elevated descendant of Countach generations' and is 'testament to the lasting impact of the original Countach design that became the poster car of the 1980s and a symbol of automotive and lifestyle ultra-cool'.

The Countach's distinctive wedge-shaped silhouette with straight lines running from front to rear have been mimicked on a modern Lamborghini shell, with designers tasked to incorporate as many sharp angles and flat edges to pay homage to the original.

Importantly, it retains the renowned scissor doors, which were first introduced on the Countach and have become a signature feature of all V12-powered Lambos through the ages.

While a number of more extreme - big-winged - versions of the initial Countach were launched in its 16-year production life and became the pin-ups of a generation, the new model is a tribute to the LP500 concept revealed at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971 and the early examples that followed when the customer-ready model was built from 1974.

It retains the distinctive Countach face and flat bonnet.

Bosses say the new car takes inspiration taken from the Quattrovalvole edition with assertive lines on the hood, a low rectangular grille and headlights, as well as in the wheel arches with their hexagonal theme. The sharp inclination of the glass 'greenhouse' engine cover adopts the straight lines redolent of the original Countach.

Like the enigmatic original, it features airscoops in the shoulders of the car, the triangular cut-out in the doors and those Countach 'gills' - which are synonymous with the original's design - to the rear of the windows.

'Distinctive Periscopio lines running through the roof to the rear of the car, particularly distinctive if viewed from above, appear to float towards the rear of the car,' design bosses explain.

It uses 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels with a design inspired by supercars of the eighties, though this time fitted with carbon ceramic brake discs and super-sticky Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres

The Countach was the first Lamborghini not to be associated with famous bulls and bullfighting. The name originated from the word 'contacc', an exclamation of astonishment in the Piedmontese language. The Diablo - translating to Devil - followed suit when it replaced the Countach in 1990

While a number of more extreme - big-winged - versions of the initial Countach were launched in its 16-year production life and became the pin-ups of a generation, the new model is a tribute to the LP500 concept revealed at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971

The rear of the Countach LPI 800-4 is also recognisable as a tribute to the eighties bedroom-wall-favourite, though not quite as book-ended as the original design.

It keeps the top-mounted engine cover from the original and also replicates the slatted panel, though with a modern twist using a stepped glass design.

The rear bumper features a lower, sleeker line, and the 'hexagonita' theme also runs into the three-unit rear light clusters.

Prices start from around £1.7million before local taxes. With VAT included, British buyers fortunate enough to land one will be paying over £2million for the new Countach

‹ Slide me › These images show the scissor doors in action. Since the Countach hit showrooms in 1974, Lamborghini enthusiasts have expected the brand's V12 supercars to have awesome door opening and closing systems

One of the standout elements inside is this enormous high-definition digital instrument cluster. All the toggle switches - like these to the left of the steering wheel - are designed to have that retro feel

The Countach LPI 800-4 gets an exclusive 8.4-inch HDMI central touchscreen. It also get the fighter-jet-style cover over the start/stop button

It also includes a unique button entitled ‘Stile’ - or 'Design'. When pressed, it loads up a documented history of the Countach design philosophy to its privileged audience

The LPI 800-4 sports the four-strong exhaust tail pipes of the Countach family, connected within the carbon fibre rear diffuser.

It uses 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels with a design inspired by supercars of the eighties, though this time fitted with carbon ceramic brake discs and super-sticky Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres.

The 112 owners of the exclusive limited edition Countach LPI 800-4 can choose from a range of heritage exterior paint options, mostly in solid colours, such as the iconic Impact White, Giallo and Verde Medio.

More contemporary new colours including grey, purple and blue join these options.

There's just as many options for the interior, with the cabin also featuring an exclusive 8.4-inch HDMI central touchscreen and an enormous high-definition digital instrument cluster.

It also includes a unique button entitled ‘Stile’ - or 'Design'. When pressed, it loads up a documented history of the Countach design philosophy to its privileged audience.

There's a massive selection of paints to choose from dating all the way back through Lamborghini's history with exclusive colours

Buyers will be able to spec their new Countach in the same Impact White colour driven by Jordan Belfort - played by Leonardo DiCaprio - in 2013 hit film, The Wolf of Wall Street. Directors infamously trashed a genuine Countach for the film's iconic scene where Belfort drives the Lamborghini home while intoxicated by a cocktail of alcohol and drugs

Lamborghini has already offered the new Countach to its most esteemed customers via the brand's exclusive app. Buyers around the world will be begin to take deliveries of from the first quarter of 2022

'The Countach is one of the most significant and exciting cars in automotive history'

Unveiling the car in California, company president and CEO, Stephan Winkelmann said: 'The Countach LPI 800-4 is a visionary car of the moment, just as its forerunner was.

'One of the most important automotive icons, the Countach not only embodies the design and engineering tenet of Lamborghini but represents our philosophy of reinventing boundaries, achieving the unexpected and extraordinary and, most importantly, being the 'stuff of dreams'.

Could the Countach also be a pin-up poster car for the current generation of budding petrolheads? It has a strong chance

With pop-up headlights all but banned due to pedestrian safety requirements of new cars, the Countach replicates the flush lamps used in earlier versions of the original

Only a limited-edition car can demand an asking price of £2million. That will partly explain why units are not as high as the 1,983 Countach model built across a 16-year production cycle

With just 112 being produced at the Italian marque's Sant'Agata Bolognese factory, there will be one new Countach for every 17 original cars

'The Countach LPI 800-4 pays homage to this Lamborghini legacy but it is not retrospective: it imagines how the iconic Countach of the 70s and 80s might have evolved into an elite super sports model of this decade.

'It upholds the Lamborghini tradition of looking forward, of exploring new design and technology avenues while celebrating the DNA of our brand. It is a Lamborghini that innately expresses the marque's enduring and emotive power: always inspirational and thrilling to see, hear and most of all drive.'

Recognised as one of the greatest supercars of all time, the Countach's wedge-shaped design - penned by Marcello Gandini - and scissor doors were a huge departure from Lamborghini's original high-performance model, the Miura.

'The Countach is one of the most significant and exciting cars in automotive history as well as in Lamborghini's heritage,' explained Mitja Borkert, Lamborghini head of design

The original model's V12 engine goes down as a legend in the automotive world - mounted longways at the rear to provide extra space for the cabin - something the new version has replicated

The original Countach was the first Lamborghini to debut scissor doors. The brand is now synonymous with them. Other supercars are now judged by how their doors open

Lamborghini announced earlier this year that every model in its range will have a hybrid version (like the new Countach) by the end of 2024. Its first fully-electric car will be unveiled in 2025

Its V12 engine also goes down as a legend in the automotive world - mounted longways at the rear to provide extra space for the cabin.

The original also boasted side-mounted radiators from Formula One, a forward-facing gearbox and tubular spaceframe technology never seen before on a road car.

In total, fewer than 2,000 examples were built between 1974 and production ending in 1990, when it was replaced by the equally-adored and just-as-bonkers Diablo.

Like the enigmatic original, it features airscoops in the shoulders of the car that give it a muscular, hunkered presence

The triangular cut-out sections in the doors have been retained, as have the 'gills' - which are synonymous with the original Countach's design - to the rear of the side windows

Bosses say they tried to capture the impact of the original. 'The Countach was provocative and polarizing, it made people smile and stare, but its infamous recognisability demonstrates the purity of its design legacy,' its design head says

Recognised as one of the greatest supercars of all time, the Countach's original wedge-shaped design - penned by Marcello Gandini - and scissor doors were a huge departure from Lamborghini's original high-performance model, the Miura. You could argue the new Countach does look somewhat similar to other extreme Lambo models released in recent years

The Countach was the first Lamborghini not to be associated with famous bulls and bullfighting. The name originated from the word 'contacc', an exclamation of astonishment in the Piedmontese language. The Diablo - translating to Devil - followed suit.

'The Countach is one of the most significant and exciting cars in automotive history as well as in Lamborghini's heritage,' explained Mitja Borkert, Lamborghini head of design.

'The Countach LPI 800-4 project is an incomparable design opportunity: to take a car so important and continue its evolution into a new era is a unique privilege.

'The Countach was provocative and polarizing, it made people smile and stare, but its infamous recognisability demonstrates the purity of its design legacy: the Countach LPI 800-4 elevates that clarity to a new level, celebrated in an exclusive limited edition to take its place in motoring history.'

Returning CEO, Stephan Winkelmann, is back at Lamborghini to spearheads the biggest transition in the history of the motor car - the switch to electric. However, it has acknowledged the importance of recognising the brand's past - especially with the return of the Countach name

‹ Slide me › Performance of the new car will be very special indeed. It will accelerate from 0-62mph in 2.8 seconds, from 0-124mph in 8.6 seconds and to a top speed of 221mph. But do you think it looks as good as the original Countach? That's up to you to decide

With such a low production run - and incredible looks - the new Lamborghini Countach LPI 800-4 is likely to draw crowds wherever it goes

A new poster car for the end of an internal combustion engine era: If there was ever a fitting tribute to petrol power and the remarkable V12 engine, the new Lamborghini Countach is just that

Those who have been fortunate enough - and rich enough - to get their name down on one of the 112 cars being made will have to pay from just over €2million (approx £1.7million). With VAT and other charges thrown in, Lamborghini officials say it would be around £2million for customers in the UK.

Buyers around the world will take deliveries from the first quarter of 2022. Lucky sods!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What's happening?

Back in the 1970s, when some of us were irresponsibly growing our hair and wearing loon pants, I remember seeing the horror on my father's face when he realised just how much of his retirement money had disappeared.

This was not through any stupid investment decisions on his part, but as a result of the economic catastrophe that was rampant inflation in our economy.

Pathetic politicians seemed powerless in the face of this economic acid, which dissolved the value of assets.

Digging deep: While commodities may not be very popular in terms of environmental issues, they do provide a good hedge against rising inflation

For a short period it peaked at just under 25 per cent per annum, which had such a dreadful effect on the economy, that the term 'banana republic' seemed almost applicable.

Why Does It Matter?

You might think this is a history lesson and that the current level of inflation is nowhere near the Seventies nightmare.

But inflation requires constant vigilance. Too much is disastrous, just as deflation (falling prices) also can be. What we actually need is Goldilocks inflation, which is a bit like her bears' best porridge, neither too hot nor too cold. Sadly, Goldilocks is fiction and so lukewarm inflation is not easy to achieve consistently.

Recently the governor of the Bank of England thought that UK inflation may well be around 4 per cent this year but thereafter hopefully keep to his target of 2 per cent. I hope he is right, but some of the indicators point to a potentially more dangerous scenario.

What Should I Do?

With interest rates effectively at 0 per cent, we are losing value in real terms on our deposit accounts, and so people have been tempted to turn to other offerings purporting to provide 'real' returns higher than inflation. The stock market should technically provide a better return, but the FTSE 100 yield is still only around 3.27 per cent.

There are things we can do. First, there are government inflation-proof bonds which will at least match inflation.

Alternatively there are some companies whose value will actually benefit from periods of inflation.

We have seen commodity prices rising this year with both oil and gas up strongly, and although this is unlikely to be repeated in the short term, commodity prices are often one of base causes for inflation.

Also, of course ,the question of gold comes in here, as probably the oldest investment to beat inflation from Cleopatra to Covid.

While commodities may not be very popular in terms of environmental issues, they do provide a good hedge against rising inflation, especially if you think that the global economy will continue its recovery following its cardiac arrest last year.

Any Suggestions?

One simple way to address this is through the Blackrock World Mining Trust, which provides a well-diversified entry into the commodity mining sector.

If, though, you would prefer a greater gold focus, then the iShares Physical Gold ETC, which is backed by the real stuff and is invested in just one inflation proof entity – the yellow metal.

This McLaren F1 sold at the weekend has set a new record to become the most expensive 1990s car to ever go under the hammer.

The 1995 version of the iconic British supercar - which has covered a mere 242 miles (390km) from new - secured a winning bid of $20,465,000 (£17.4million) in the US at the weekend, making it the priciest model from the 1990s to sell at auction and also the costliest modern-era vehicle to go to the block.

Described as an 'Exceptional time capsule' example of the McLaren F1 road car - of which just 64 were made - and finished in a unique colour combination of Creighton Brown paint and a Light Tan and Brazilian Brown interior, it received a rapturous applause from the sales room at Pebble Beach in California when the hammer eventually dropped following a fraught bidding war between collectors.

Mighty McLaren: This 1995 example of the iconic F1 supercar has become the most expensive motor from the 1990s - and the priciest modern-era vehicle - of all time to sell at auction

The barely-driven McLaren was sold on Saturday by Gooding & Company during its two-day auction during Monterey Car Week.

The winning bid far exceeded the pre-sale estimate, which predicted a figure closer to $15million.

'If there is a single car that best represents the past, present, and future of the automobile, it is the McLaren F1,' says David Brynan, senior specialist at the auction house.

This example is now the most expensive motor from its decade, marginally outpricing a sister car - a 1994 F1 in LM Specification - which was sold by RM Sotheby's also in Monterey for $19,805,000 in 2019.

In terms of more expensive cars that have sold at auction, the next-youngest model is a whopping 28 years older than the McLaren - a 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 S NART Spider sold in 2013.

The driving force behind the F1's astronomical sale price is undoubtedly the low mileage.

With just 242 miles on the clock since 1995, it has averaged just 9.3 miles each year it has been in existence.

It is chassis 029 and, according to factory records, was the 25th F1 built at McLaren's workshop in Woking and the final example built in 1994, having been completed on 23 December.

The 1995 version of the iconic British supercar secured a winning bid of $20,465,000 (£17.4million) at the Gooding & Company Pebble Beach auction in Monterey, California on Saturday

Despite having three owners from new, the car has covered a mere 242 miles (390km) in 26 years. That's an average annual mileage of 9 miles for each year it has been in existence

Its owners have all stored the vehicle in their own displays and treated the British icon meticulously, barely scrubbing in the original tyres it was sold with

The car is particularly notable for its elegant metallic brown livery, which is a unique colour not shared with any other F1 and named after the commercial director for McLaren Cars, Creighton Brown.

Mr Brown, who died in 2006, was one of the British brand's senior representatives along with designer Gordon Murray, race-team boss Ron Dennis, and McLaren shareholder Mansour Ojjeh who, in a famous 1988 Milan Linate airport meeting, made the decision to create an F1 road car project.

Inside, the exterior brown is contrasted with light tan leather and Alcantara, with contrasting Brazilian Brown leather accents and brown carpeting.

It was sold on Saturday with its complementing matching four-piece luggage set, handbook folio, and tool roll were all trimmed in matching light tan leather.

�� ATTENTION �� This is not a drill! The 1995 #McLaren F1 — one of only 64 built — has just #SOLD for an astronomical $20,465,000! The crowd is electric! #GoodingPebble pic.twitter.com/41Fn7o32Kc — Gooding & Company (@goodingandco) August 14, 2021

Chassis 029 was delivered new in 1995 to a private Japanese collector who stored it in a static museum display for the next 17 years.

This was so the McLaren could be 'admired for its technical and aesthetic achievements', says Brynan. As a result, it was driven 'sparingly'.

In fact, most of the 242 miles it has accrued in total are believed to have been clocked during promotional filming at a test track near Tsukuba in Japan.

The F1 remained in the hands of its original owner until 2012, when it was sold to Shinji Takei of Tokyo. Just a year later, it was sold again to an American collector whose private garage philosophy is described as 'the best of the best'.

When it arrived in the US in April 2013, the odometer read 196 miles (316km) - meaning it has added just 46 miles in the last eight years.

The car received a rapturous applause from the sales room at Pebble Beach in California on Saturday when the hammer eventually dropped following a fraught bidding war between collectors

The McLaren is like none of the other 64 road cars produced. It is finished in a unique colour combination of Creighton Brown paint and a Light Tan and Brazilian Brown interior

The F1's BMW-developed V12 engine developed a then-staggering 627bhp. It had a claimed top speed of 231mph (372km/h), though with the removal of the rev-limiter could hit 242.96mph (391.01 km/h). In 1993, it obliterated the previous road-car top speed record and held the moniker for a staggering 12 years, when it was eventually dethroned by the Bugatti Veyron in 2005

That's not surprising given the lot description for the vehicle states that it 'has not been driven any distance, nor has it been publicly exhibited' - though the current owner has each month started its 6.1-litre V12 engine and ran it to operating temperature, as well as carrying out fluid changes on a regular basis.

'A credit to the foresight of its three private owners, 029 is presented today in exceptional original condition. In all respects, this is a benchmark, time capsule example of the definitive modern-day supercar,' explained Brynan ahead of the sale.

McLaren F1: Will it fit in my temperature-controlled garage? The McLaren F1 was sold from 1992 for a price of £540,000. The one sold this weekend achieved almost 27 times that amount Production: 64 road cars Price when new: From £540,000 (approx $815,000) Built: Woking, Surrey Doors: 2 Seats: 3 Engine: 6.1-litre 48 valve V-12 petrol developed by BMW Power: 627bhp Acceleration: 0–60mph (97km/h): 3.2 seconds 0–100mph (160km/h): 6.3 seconds 0–200mph (320km/h): 28 seconds Top Speed: With rev limiter on: 231mph (372km/h) With rev limiter removed: 242.96mph (391.01km/h) Record top speed based on average of two runs: 221mph (355km/h) Record duration: Set in 1993, bettered in 2005 by Bugatti Veyron Dimensions: Length: 4,287mm Width: 1,820mm Height: 1,140mm Weight: 1,138kg

'Not only does this McLaren retain its factory-applied paint and interior finishes, its various identification plates and labels also remain intact. Even its Goodyear Eagle tires, specially designed for the F1, are the original ones supplied with the car when new, as confirmed by their 1994 date codes.

'Similarly, the F1 still retains its January 1995-dated Premier fuel cell manufacturer's label and the original McLaren Track Record plaque, with the last line acknowledging the team's 104 Grand Prix wins in 1993,' he added.

The winning bidder also got their hands on its important accessories and spares that were delivered along with the car as new.

That includes a French-made Facom tool chest and leather tool roll, which features gold-plated titanium components. The car's matching-brown integrated storage panniers contain the four-piece fitted luggage set, together with the serial-numbered leather folio which contains the service and warranty book, owner's manual, and flashlight.

The new owner also got their hands on a TAG Heuer 6000 Chronometer wristwatch, deluxe edition of Driving Ambition: The Official Inside Story of the McLaren F1, written by Doug Nye in collaboration with Ron Dennis and Gordon Murray, a car cover and McLaren gloves exclusive to the brand's mechanics.

Between 1994 and 1998, McLaren built just 64 examples of the iconic F1 road car. These remarkable machines have since become among the most sought-after of all classic cars, a model which is on nearly every serious collector's wish list.

One of those cars was owned and famously twice crashed by British actor, Rowan Atkinson.

The Mr Bean star first ploughed the exotic supercar into the back of a Rover Metro on the A6 at Forton, Lancashire, in October 1999.

Then in 2011 he lost control on a slippery bend of the A605 near Peterborough and smashed into a tree.

He escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder, but most of the car was destroyed, with the high-performance 6.1-litre engine reportedly ending up 60 feet away from the chassis.

That second crash ended in what is thought to be Britain's highest ever single car insurance payout, with the vehicle costing £900,000 to be rebuilt by McLaren. It also put up his annual insurance to an estimated £60,000.

Despite almost being written off twice, Atkinson sold his F1 in June 2015 for £8million - a tidy £7.3million profit on the £640,000 he'd paid for it in 1996.

Other famous keepers include the likes of Jay Leno, George Harrison, Ralph Lauren, Nick Mason, Elon Musk and the Sultan of Brunei.

Chassis 029 was delivered new in 1995 to a private Japanese collector who stored it in a static museum display for the next 17 years. This was so the McLaren could be 'admired for its technical and aesthetic achievements', says Gooding & Co expert, David Brynan

Under its original ownership, the F1 was driven 'sparingly'. In fact, most of the 242 miles it has accrued in total are believed to have been clocked during promotional filming at a test track near Tsukuba in Japan

Having been sold to another enthusiast in Japan in 2012, it was again sold in 2013 and shipped to become part of an esteemed US car collector. It was 'driven sparingly' and never displayed at events. Though the keeper did warm the engine every month and meticulously changed its fluids on a regular basis

It was - and still is - the closest thing to a Formula One car for the road with a concept and execution unlike any other production road car and remains the benchmark by which all other super- and hypercars are judged.

Produced by the official McLaren F1 team's operation, it used the finest materials available including aluminuim, titanium, carbon fibre, and even gold.

Ground-breaking features of F1 debuted included a carbon monocoque chassis with a three-seat cockpit with the driver positioned centrally and flanked by a pair of passenger chairs.

The BMW-developed V12 engine developed a then-staggering 627bhp, enough to propel the svelte supercar to 60mph in just 3.2 seconds and to a top speed of 231mph (372km/h) - with the rev-limiter removed, up to 242.96mph (391.01 km/h).

In 1993, it obliterated the previous road-car top speed record and held the moniker for a staggering 12 years, when it was eventually dethroned by the Bugatti Veyron in 2005.

Some 106 McLaren F1s were built in total, though just 64 were road-registered and the rest used for competition, notably taking class wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995, the 1995 BPR Championship, the 1996 Global GT Endurance Championship, and later serving as the foundation for BMW's own successful endurance racing program.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Wet weather, the Delta variant and fraught holiday plans may have made this an August to forget for most of us.

But in corporate Britain, these drizzly days of 2021 will go down in the annals as the Summer of Sell-offs.

Globally, nearly 900 takeovers have been announced in the past 12 months, worth a total of $1.6trillion. In the UK, transactions in the first seven months of 2021 hit a 14- year high by value of $198billion (£142billion), according to research by Refinitiv.

Standing up for business: Directors have a legal duty to promote the success of the business

Deals in Germany and France are running at a fraction of the levels seen here. This is not, as some ministers claim, a thumbs-up for the UK economy by overseas investors. It is because foreign predators can see how easily boards and politicians roll over here.

It is hard to keep up with the firms under siege. Bid battles for supermarket group Morrisons, inhaler maker Vectura and aerospace company Meggitt are making headlines, but the likes of Watchstone, GCP Student Living, Audioboom, Tricorn and Restore have barely registered. This blizzard of bids is a test for boards, for big shareholders and for government.

Decisions taken now will shape corporate Britain for years. How we deal with these takeovers will have a huge impact on society, the defence of the realm and our capability in key sectors.

Will we embrace an extreme version of free-market capitalism, even if it means flogging off much of our defence sector, and even if other countries do no such thing? Is it right for the short-term interests of investors – selling to the highest bidder – to trump the concerns of other stakeholders, such as employees, taxpayers and communities?

Shareholders and boards tout their enthusiasm for ESG, or socially responsible and green investment. But should the concept of ESG be widened to encompass the avoidance of reckless debt, misuse of tax shelters and other chicanery?

These are questions investors and directors should be asking themselves. Instead they seem preoccupied solely with price.

Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman of Meggitt, who has sold a string of businesses, says government will have to intervene if a bidder tries to muscle in without binding commitments on investment and jobs. It is difficult for him to do so, he says, because he has a fiduciary duty to shareholders.

Rudd, who claims he is not in the least bothered by his nickname of 'Sir Sell-off', gave a self-justificatory interview in The Sunday Times yesterday on the topic. Yet in several high-profile contests, including the fight for control of Meggitt and also Vectura and Morrisons, neither suitor is remotely desirable. But they have not been sent packing. Bids have been recommended, only for more generous ones to emerge.

There have been more flip-flops in Britain's boardrooms this summer than on a Brazilian beach. It suggests chairmen have a shaky grasp on the long-term value of their businesses.

Yet it is perfectly possible to reject a bid, as engineering group Senior has done repeatedly – so far. Dame Clara Furse, the former boss of the London Stock Exchange, was besieged but saw off all comers.

Lord Myners, who has said the boards in this country lack 'stomach,' repelled an approach for M&S by Sir Philip Green.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kit Harington recently discussed how he was previously unfamiliar with his character in the upcoming Marvel film Eternals.

The 34-year-old actor appeared on Thursday's episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and revealed that he had to perform a web search on Dane Whitman when he received the part.

The Game Of Thrones star is currently set to appear in the forthcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe entry, which will be made available to the public in the near future.

Doing his research: Kit Harington revealed that he had to Google Dane Whitman after being cast in Eternals on Thursday's episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon

Harington told the show's host that, when he was initially cast in Eternals, he was simply informed about the character that he would be portraying.

He recalled: 'I didn't get sent a script. I just got sent, "This is who you're playing." So I was like, "Okay."'

The performer then revealed that he had to look the superhero up on the Internet, as he had never heard of the swordsman.

'I just had to Google the character. This is you know, a hell of a way to kind of work out who you're playing,' he noted.

Being blunt: Harington revealed that he did not receive a script, stating: 'I just got sent, "This is who you're playing."'

One way or another: The Game Of Thrones star expressed that 'a hell of a way to kind of work out who you're playing'

Harington then humorously drew a parallel between the superhero and the person he portrayed on Game Of Thrones, Jon Snow.

'I Googled him. He's a character called Dane Whitman, and I realized he has a sword and rides a horse. And I was like, I know this guy. I've been this guy,' he said.

Although he pointed out that the two sounded similar conceptually, the actor noted that Whitman was 'quite different, so it's exciting.'

Fallon then pressed Harington to reveal if Harry Styles would be appearing in the forthcoming flick, about which the performer remained tight-lipped.

One more time: Harington drew a parallel between Jon Snow and Dane Whitman, stating that he 'realized he has a sword and rides a horse. And I was like, I know this guy'

Tight lips: When Fallon pressed the actor to reveal if Harry Styles would appear in the forthcoming feature, the performer did not give a definitive answer

Development on Eternals began in 2018, and its director, Chloe Zhao, was confirmed to be helming the project that September.

The upcoming superhero film will serve as one of the first entries in the MCU's recently-started Phase Four.

Several actors were added to the feature's cast the following year, including Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani, among numerous others.

Shooting had begun by the summer of 2019, with new cast members being added over the course of production.

Keeping it going: Production on Eternals had begun by the summer of 2019 and new cast members were added during the filming process

The film's crew later moved to England in 2020 to capture further scenes, and principal photography ended that February.

Eternals' first teaser was released this past May and was met with a positive reception from both critics and fans.

The film was initially set to be released in November of last year, although it was delayed several times due to the onset of the global pandemic.

Eternals is currently set to be made available to the public on November 5th.

Judges Shaynna Blaze, Darren Palmer and Neale Whitaker criticised the couple for their 'bland' styling and the size of the room.

'I actually feel quite claustrophobic in here, it feels very, very small. Oppressively small actually,' Neale said.

'That is not the kind of rookie error I would expect from Mitch and Mark.'

Neale added: 'I'm finding this a little bland. But I feel this room is quite generic and that's not a word I would ever have used with Mitch and Mark.'

The feedback landed Mitch and Mark at the bottom of the leader board with 22.5 points.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum were Ronnie and Georgia Caceres, who landed the top score of 24.5.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Emerging and frontier markets represent the best opportunity for investors to profit over the next five, 10 or 20 years, according to Dr Mark Mobius.

As a veteran emerging markets investor, he admits that he is ‘a little biased’ and you would expect him to say that.

But he has also put his money where his mouth is, coming out of a brief four-month retirement to launch the Mobius Investment Trust to profit from the potential growth of smaller and mid-sized emerging and frontier market companies.

Mark joined us on the latest Investing Show to outline why he believes emerging and frontier markets currently represent great value and the companies that he favours.

He shares his investment outlook, how he finds companies to invest in and why ‘by and large we like to go after those countries that are in trouble. Where the news is very negative’, as that provides the opportunity for good companies at bargain prices.

He also explains to Simon Lambert, of This is Money, and Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, the benefit of the trust and accompanying fund’s environmental, social and governance controls and why that can mean better profits from better run companies.

Will the UK stock market rise this year?

The FTSE 100 index has made a series of record highs this year but is down on where it started 2018.

The next few months will define whether this year was a good one for UK investors, but how are they likely to pan out?

Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter take a look at the outlook for investors and whether the bull market has further to run, or is likely to be sunk.

We ask Gary Greenberg, manager of Hermes Global Emerging Markets, the top fund in the sector over five years, which has almost doubled investors money over that time.

He explains why emerging markets picked up in 2015 from the bear market they had suffered and says that while a year to 18 months ago they represented a value opportunity, that is a harder case to make now.

But Gary, who has been an emerging markets specialist throughout the past three decades, explains why he believes a strong opportunity remains for the long-term and where investors need to look for the best returns - or the least risk.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Philip Morris International and a US private equity behemoth are set to go head-to-head in an auction for British inhaler maker Vectura.

The face-off aims to break a to-and-fro takeover battle that has seen the tobacco giant and The Carlyle Group put in multiple offers in a matter of weeks for the Chippenham-based business.

All three companies have agreed that the five-day auction – which will be overseen by the Takeover Panel – is the best way to break the deadlock.

Takeover target: Philip Morris and The Carlyle Group have both put in multiple offer for British inhaler maker Vectura in a matter of weeks

The aim of the auction is to get to the point where Philip Morris and Carlyle have made final offers, which they will not be able to change.

This is the only way to resolve the bidding war, otherwise each firm could, if regulators allowed it, keep leapfrogging one another for many more weeks.

And fears are growing that Vectura could be kept under lengthy siege if the pair are left to continue.

Sky’s takeover in 2018 was settled by a one-day auction process, which resulted in a blockbuster £31billion deal from Comcast.

Vectura has previously warned that business is starting to slow in the wake of the frenzy.

Shares in the FTSE 250-listed company rose 5.5 per cent, or 9p, to 173p, as traders priced in the next stage of the stand-off.

The unusual move comes after Marlboro-maker Philip Morris – known as PMI – made a £1.02billion offer for Vectura on Sunday.

This was just two days after Carlyle offered £928million.

Vectura had backed Carlyle’s latest bid – but decided to withdraw support yesterday and refused to recommend the PMI offer, creating an impasse.

Vectura specialises in making inhalers and nebulisers, but it also helps top drug companies convert their medicines into powders that can be inhaled. Customers include Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Glaxosmithkline.

If PMI or Carlyle puts forward a final offer for Vectura by 5pm today, the auction will not go ahead.

But if neither does, the process begins and will last five working days from tomorrow until August 17, or until a day when neither side puts in a new offer.

Each day the companies will announce their latest price to the stock market, so investors will be able to track bids.

When the auction ends, Vectura will be left with two final offers which it will then be able to weigh up. If it decides to recommend one then it will go to a shareholder vote, which needs to win 75 per cent of the ballot.

The battle has been highly controversial, with many in the City keen for Vectura neither to become victim to yet another private equity swoop nor for a company that treats lung conditions to fall into the hands of Big Tobacco.

But PMI boss Jacek Olczak said taking over Vectura would help it become a ‘broader health and wellness company’.

The company is aiming to eventually stop selling cigarettes. However, tobacco products still account for 75 per cent of its sales and its move has triggered outrage from health campaigners, with the British Thoracic Society saying it presents an ‘unresolvable ethical conflict’. The European Respiratory Society said it was ‘very alarmed’.

Carlyle is keen to expand the business and it already has support from 11pc of shareholders for its bid. But private equity firms have a torrid reputation for breaking firms up after just a few years and selling off the pieces.

Some observers believe the Vectura board could plump for Carlyle even if PMI puts in a bid that is higher, on the grounds that it is better for the company’s overall long-term interest.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‘It’s a high-stakes decision for Vectura, with the board coming under fire from some for even considering the bid from tobacco giant Philip Morris.

The importance of companies on the front line like Vectura, and its partnership with UK-based Inspira, has become even more important in the context of Covid.’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@More than five years since pension freedom arrived a solution to take the pain out of investing in retirement is being lined up.

Before pension freedom many savers were locked into buying an annuity with their personal pensions or defined contribution work schemes – and a lot of them felt they were getting a raw deal.

That’s meant that keeping a pension invested and drawing on it as you choose in retirement has proved a very popular option. It is also a very tricky one to navigate – but now some simple help is at hand, so will it crack the conundrum of pension freedom without the pain?

Tumbling annuity rates, an industry that failed to make sure people shopped around and the gamble on life expectancy that meant if you died early then you and your family would lose out, made annuities hugely unpopular.

So, Chancellor George Osborne came up with a big bang approach that meant nobody had to if they didn’t want to anymore.

The problem is that many people had simply opted for a ‘pay money into my pension while working and not think about it’ approach and so had no real idea how to invest for retirement.

Pension freedom without the pain? A new simple way to invest is being flagged

Now the industry has come up with a solution that involves savers being offered four ready-made investment deals when they first dip into their pension pots, if they do so without financial advice.

On this week’s podcast George Frost, Tanya Jefferies and Simon Lambert, discuss whether this is the answer that savers need.

They also look at the tsunami of pension and investment scams, what people can do to protect themselves and ask whether it’s the FCA or Google and the social media companies that should be doing more to crack down on it.

Simon outlines his theory on why just as we are about to be able to get out and enjoy ourselves again, some big ticket inflation might hit.

And the team look at another Santander 123 account rate cut – is it time for customers to finally give up, or is it a deal still worth having?

Klarna, Laybuy and the rest of the delayed spending crew are coming in for lots of scrutiny at the moment.

Shoppers love them and shops pay them, but there are concerns on over-spending and the cost of not meeting payments.

Yet, surely spreading the cost of a purchase interest-free is a sensible financial move?

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Lee Boyce and Simon Lambert discuss the rise of the buy now, pay later firms, how they work, how they make their money on interest-free credit, and why there are worries over what on the surface looks like a great deal.

On the topic of shopping, the team also talk trying to avoid Amazoning everything this Christmas – and where to turn to get things from local shops with convenience.

Also, on this week’s show they look at why the Bank of England held interest rates even as more tiers pain descended on Britain, the website that matches start-up ideas and the people who can do the work and finally Grace Gausden joins the show to discuss her Grace on the Case consumer column.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The latest Santander 123 account rate cut, trying to turn a profit on mortgage holidays, how we pay for the coronavirus crisis and furlough scheme and the crash in car sales all feature on this week’s This is Money podcast.

Once upon a time, Santander’s 123 could lay claim to being the king of the current accounts.

As banks battled to customers to switch, Santander’s cashback and 3 per cent interest-packing deal was one of the main challengers for the crown.

The shine came off slightly when that interest rate was chopped to 1.5 per cent in 2016, but now the 123 account has been doubly dented with a rate cut to 0.6 per cent announced on the very same day the rate was already being cut to 1 per cent.

In all but name it’s now the Santander 1, 2, 0.6 account and that doesn’t quite have the same attraction.

But when letters are coming through the post telling you that your savings account has been chopped to 0.01 per cent, perhaps it is still worth bagging a current account paying 0.6 per cent.

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost look at why Santander has chopped again, if the deal is still worth taking regardless, and whether the great current account switching push has fizzled out.

Olympic star Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill was one of the stars of Santander's 123 advert campaigns, alongside Jensen Button and Lewis Hamilton

Next up on the podcast is mortgage holidays.

Figures show almost 2 million people have taken up the option of a break from their mortgage payments, but some who don’t need to take one have been wondering if it might be a financially savvy move to do so anyway.

Could you save or invest the skipped payments and make money in the long run? And even if that is possible, is it ethical?

Plus with 6.3 million people furloughed, can we really expect the mortgage holidays to end in June – and how does the nation pay for the colossal coronavirus rescue package?

And finally, Britain’s best-selling car in April was Tesla’s Model 3 but astonishingly it wasn’t the most sold vehicle.

That accolade went to a van, the Mercedes Sprinter, but will the motor industry be changed by all this and electric cars gain a firmer foothold in future?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Battleground: Major banks are locked in a mortgage price war as they scramble to lend

Goldman Sachs has warned that strict banking rules have triggered a mortgage price war which experts say is driving the cheapest home loans on record and sending house prices through the roof.

The US investment bank believes the performance of high street banks is coming under mounting pressure as they scramble to lend to home buyers at ever lower rates.

Tough 'ring-fencing' rules imposed on banks after the financial crisis were aimed at ensuring that billions in customer savings could not be funnelled into 'casino' investment banking operations.

But this has made banks pile into the mortgage market – considered low-risk lending – which has forced down the interest rates that they charge to generate profits.

The warning comes after banks and building societies launched some of the cheapest mortgage deals on record.

Halifax will tomorrow launch one of the cheapest two-year deals ever at 0.83 per cent for borrowers with a 40 per cent deposit.

Last month, Nationwide offered a five-year deal with a rate of 0.99 per cent.

Ray Boulger, a mortgage expert at broker John Charcol, said this was the 'first time the UK has seen a deal on five-year, fixed-rate mortgages below 1 per cent'.

Rival lenders including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, NatWest and TSB have followed suit. One bank chairman told The Mail on Sunday: 'Ringfencing is fuelling house prices because mortgages are so cheap.

'It's another regulatory intervention that is driving cheap money, and this is making it even tougher for first time buyers to get on the ladder.'

The mortgage price war has already forced Sainsbury's Bank and Tesco Bank out of the market.

Senior analysts at Goldman Sachs have reduced their share price forecasts for Lloyds, NatWest, Barclays and Virgin Money 'to reflect headwinds in UK mortgage pricing'.

Banks have seen £370billion of customer deposits flood in since the start of 2020, while lending has grown by just £100billion, which Goldman said has left a huge pool of savings dormant in the banks.

Mortgages account for most of the £100billion figure.

Goldman said: 'This has resulted in a substantial increase in excess deposits trapped in the ring-fences of major banks.'

The analysts said: 'This in our view is the key reason for mortgage pricing having fallen. The decline in pricing occurred faster than we expected.'

Andy Golding, chief executive of OneSavings Bank, a specialist mortgage lender, said: 'I think in the high street banking market it's definitely having a downward impact on mortgage pricing.

'The big high street banks have got to do something with all the ringfenced cash they're sitting on – and so they're pumping it into residential mortgages at exceptionally low rates.

'If that becomes the norm, the high street market will become absolutely dominated by the high street banks, meaning the smaller building societies won't be able to compete at all.'

The fresh warning will fuel the debate over whether the ring-fencing rules are fit for purpose.

The Treasury has kicked off a review led by Keith Skeoch, the former boss of Standard Life Aberdeen, who will report the findings to Chancellor Rishi Sunak early next year.

The Mail on Sunday revealed last month that former Barclays boss Bob Diamond was lobbying for the end to ring-fencing rules.

It is understood that he hopes to unlock deals in the banking sector for his investment firm Atlas Merchant Capital. But some banking experts believe the ring-fencing rules are not solely to blame.

A source close to HSBC said the bank retreated from the mortgage market after it was burned by subprime mortgages during the financial crisis.

He said: 'The big strategic shift was when HSBC went back into the broker market in 2015, before ringfencing even came into force.'

Mortgage brokers account for the lion's share of the market, with only a small percentage of loans being dished out directly by the banks.

HSBC's share of the mortgage market has nearly doubled to 10 per cent since 2015.

The biggest high street banks have said over the past few weeks that demand for cheap mortgages has been so high that they are struggling to keep up – even as the stamp duty holiday started to taper off at the end of June.

William Chalmers, chief financial officer of Lloyds Banking Group, the biggest mortgage lender, said the market is getting 'more competitive'. He added the bank will keep an eye on mortgage lending to protect profits.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Thousands more bereaved families are set to be given vital financial support thanks to a change in the Government's eligibility rules.

When someone passes away, their family is often entitled to bereavement support payments to help in those difficult first few months.

Under the current system, the money is paid only to families where the deceased was married or in a civil partnership.

However, eligibility will be extended next year to include non-married cohabiting couples following a Supreme Court ruling.

Support: Laura with her late partner Nigel and their son Noah, a year before the proud dad passed away

More than 22,000 additional families will then be able to claim this help, totalling £320million over the next five years.

What support is available – and how to claim it

Surviving spouses can claim bereavement support payments of up to £9,800 across 18 months following their partner's death.

That can be a lifeline for families hit with a loss of a partner or parent. They are likely to face a drop in household income, additional childcare costs and funeral bills.

To be eligible, the bereaved must have been under State pension age when their partner died.

The partner must have paid National Insurance contributions for at least 25 weeks in one tax year since 1975 or died because of an accident at work or a disease caused by work.

Bereaved spouses receive £2,500 plus £100 monthly for 18 months, or if they are entitled to child benefit, they receive £3,500 plus £350 for 18 months.

At the moment, payments are still made only to families where the couple were married or in a civil partnership.

However, with next year's changes, back payments will be made as lump sums back to August 30, 2018.

The bereavement support payments, introduced in 2017, replaced the more generous widowed parent's allowance, which had been in place since 2001.

Under the previous scheme, young families who lost a parent could claim support until the children turned 18. Some families are still receiving these payments.

To claim support, you can contact the Bereavement Service Helpline on 0800 731 0469.

IT WILL MAKE SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE Laura Rudd's world came crashing down in March last year, when her partner Nigel died suddenly aged 50 while out on a jog. The couple had been together for nine years and had a son, Noah, now four. But because they were not married, Laura was denied financial support. The Government's changes will mean Laura, 35, should receive backdated bereavement support payments of just under £10,000. However, it could still be months until she receives the money. 'The difference that money could make to me as a lone parent is phenomenal,' says Laura. 'When you lose your partner, although it may feel like it, the world does not end – there are still bills to pay. 'Suddenly you are responsible for everything – the mortgage, council tax, keeping a roof over your heads. A basic funeral also costs around £3,500.' Laura, who is a psychology teacher from Wilberfoss, near York, adds: 'I've spoken to people who not only lose their partner, they also lose their home. 'I see the damage that does to families, and how physical and mental health can suffer. I'm looking forward to using the support payments to look after my son's future.'

Why the Government is making changes now

In 2018, a mother of four won a major court case on bereavement benefits, forcing a Government rethink. Siobhan McLaughlin had been living with her partner John Adams for 23 years when he died in 2014. They had four children together.

McLaughlin, from County Antrim, was denied the widowed parent's allowance because they were not married.

She successfully challenged the decision in the Supreme Court, which ruled that denying her the allowance was incompatible with human rights legislation.

In 2020, the High Court also ruled that denying the new-style bereavement support payment to two bereaved unmarried fathers and their children was similarly incompatible.

The Government finally announced in July that it was amending legislation to change the eligibility criteria. However, the amendments need to be approved by Parliament, which could take months. There is still some uncertainty about who will receive the full entitlement.

Charity WAY Widowed and Young is calling on the Government to ensure retrospective payments are made to all those who would have been eligible had they been married, whether under the newer bereavement support payments system or the previous widowed parent's allowance.

Georgia Elms, ambassador for the charity, adds: 'It is regrettable that it has taken so long for the Government to respond to the court judgments and that thousands of bereaved parents and their children have lost out on the financial support they so vitally needed during that time.'

Why the support is essential for families

Bereavement support payments are paid for from the National Insurance contributions of the person who has passed away. The deceased may have paid tens of thousands of pounds in contributions towards a State pension they will never be alive to claim.

Instead, some of that money is given to their children or partner when they need it most.

The payments help widows bringing up children with a sudden drop in family income, or help families to find the money needed for immediate costs after a loved one passes away.

Widows or widowers bringing up young children may also want to take some time out of work to look after their youngsters, or may not feel strong enough to get straight back to work. Those who do are likely to face higher childcare costs.

Do unmarried couples have the same rights?

Almost half of people in England and Wales mistakenly believe that unmarried couples who live together have a common law marriage and enjoy the same rights as couples who are legally married, according to the National Centre for Social Research.

In reality, common law marriage is a status the law does not recognise. However, the Supreme Court ruled that a child should not be treated differently because of the marital status of its parents – a situation over which a child has no control.

British car manufacturer Morgan has unveiled its latest model that will allow sports car fanatics to tackle the harshest landscapes - granted they can afford one of the eight examples being built.

The Plus Four CX-T is like no other road-legal Morgan seen before. With off-road tyres, hardcore suspension and a protective exoskeleton, it's be co-created with Rally Raid UK - renowned for building race cars to take on the Dakar Rally - to deal with the toughest terrains a driver could throw at it.

And it won't come cheap. The limited run of eight cars will cost a whopping £204,000 each.

Morgan's mad new off-roader: This is the iconic British brand's new retro model - a hardcore rally raid machine designed to take on the toughest terrains imaginable

Morgan says its new Plus Four CX-T is 'a car with adventure at its core' and one with 'capability not yet witnessed on a Morgan sports car'.

While it is like nothing we've seen in a Morgan sales brochure before, it does hark back to Morgan's history of competing in all-terrain endurance trials going back more than a century.

As early as 1911, Morgan sports cars were competing and winning in off-road competitions.

Called the CX-T, it is a modified version of the Morgan Plus Four that's had a full make over to ensure it can tackle the harshest routes

Just 8 examples of the Plus Four CX-T are going to be built by the Worcestershire car maker, each with a staggering purchase price

Before taxes, each example will cost £170,000. Add VAT for UK customers and that sends the price to £204,000 - easily stepping into Ferrari and Lamborghini supercar territory

According to the Worcestershire specialist car maker, its 'more adventurous' customers have been calling for a modern-era version to take away from the tarmac for years.

Prices will start from £170,000, though with the addition of VAT in the UK means the total outlay is £204,000 - that's easily stepping into Ferrari, Lamborghini and McLaren supercar territory and around four times the price of a standard Morgan Plus Four.

Buyers of the eight cars will be invited to the brand's factory in Malvern to specify their own CX-T. Once built, it be sent to Rally Raid UK's workshop in Huddersfield for final preparation and setup before being unleashed on rock-riddled routes.

Morgan says its new Plus Four CX-T is 'a car with adventure at its core' and one with 'capability not yet witnessed on a Morgan sports car'

If you want one of the 8 cars being built, you can order it now. Morgan says all examples will be produced and ready to deliver before the end of the year

'The project was unrestrained and born entirely from a desire to create an exciting British adventure vehicle,' says head of design, Jonathan Wells

The Plus Four CX-T is on sale now, with all eight vehicles due to be built before the end of 2021.

Jonathan Wells, head of design, Morgan Motor Company, said: 'The Morgan design team has been conceptualising modern day trialling vehicles for many years. Around 18 months ago, our investors and CEO, Steve Morris, were in the studio and remarked how incredible it would be to bring one of these drawings to life.

'The project was unrestrained and born entirely from a desire to create an exciting British adventure vehicle.

'The CX-T, like many recent Morgan vehicles, demonstrates the flexibility of the Morgan design. For me, it’s a complete package: historical integrity, legitimate capability, and a brand-new adventure-lead aesthetic.'

Even when driving off-road, the CX-T should be good for a 0-62mph sprint in around 5 seconds

The total power output is 255bhp and it will be sold with the choice of either a six-speed manual gearbox or an eight-speed ZF auto - both BMW compontents

The design team says its bonkers off-road version of the sports car has been designed to maximise luggage and equipment carrying capacity, and provide the occupant protection necessary for extreme environments

Powering the car is the same 2.0-litre, single-turbo, four-cylinder BMW powerplant that already features in the conventional Plus Four sports car

Retro Morgan looks but wrapped in a bonkers protective exoskeleton

Under the side-hinged bonnet is the same 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged BMW engine used in the conventional Plus Four.

It produces a 255bhp, which should be enough to launch it to 62mph in under 5 seconds, though slightly longer if customers opt for a six-speed manual gearbox rather than an eight-speed ZF auto, which is also taken from the German marque.

But it's there that the similarities seemingly end.

The design team says its bonkers off-road version of the sports car has been designed to maximise luggage and equipment carrying capacity, and provide the occupant protection necessary for extreme environments.

Your eye is first drawn to the exoskeleton roll cage that wraps around the cabin area and consists of an equipment rack at the rear of the vehicle.

Morgan has ensured the driver is fully protected with an exoskeletal roll cage that wraps around the classically-style panels

The Plus Four CX-T's rack is there to provide all the necessary kit for a weekend of dune driving or serious off-roading

The rear deck holds two 'ruggedised' and waterproof luggage cases, an aluminium storage box for tools, two 11-litre fuel containers and a pair of spare wheels and a jack. The external frame also holds the rear brake lights

The underside of the car has also been fully protected, in case enthusiast owners clip a rock or boulder on their rally excursions

Underneath the crash protection are unique body panels designed to fit the external scaffolding but still retain the iconic classic four-seater Morgan look.

If a driver does get unstuck off the beaten track, the car has winch points mounted on the exterior of the car within easy reach, just in case you need the support of a Land Rover or similar 4X4 to pull you out of a tight spot.

The protective exoskeleton can also be adapted to carry leisure equipment such as bikes and surf boards, to compliment the lifestyle activities of the owner, while the removable side screens can be mounted onto the roof of the vehicle, allowing them to be carried in case of a change in weather conditions.

At the front, the crash bars can also house four high-powered spotlights for those late evenings blasting across deserts and other challenging landscapes and a rally-inspired number board for the authentic off-road look.

Hardcore suspension means it can take on the toughest endurance rally events

To ensure it can cope with the harshest of terrains, Rally Raid UK undertook a durability assessments of the platform, drivetrain, and suspension systems of the standard Plus Four before recommending the adaptation that will turn it into an off-road weapon.

The suspension has been designed to be 'expedition ready'.

It features a ground clearance of 230mm - enough to scale a rock or two - and required a widened track (the distance across the width of the vehicle) so that adequate suspension components can be fitted.

While it uses existing Morgan wishbones, it has longer suspension arms, bespoke bushes and competition-ready coilovers and bumpstops.

The design team has even had to modify the wheel arches to make them deeper so the long-travel suspension can compress into the wheel well.

'The combined suspension package is optimised to undertake journeys never before attempted in a Morgan sports car, while ensuring composure and comfort during any excursion into the back country,' according to the UK firm.

At all four corners - and the two spares - are lightweight allow wheels wrapped in performance off-road rubber that should help put all 255 horses down even on loose surfaces

Huge Group B rally-like mudflaps should prevent following vehicles being pebble-dashed when the driver floors the throttle

Protecting the underside of the vehicle is a five-piece underbody protection system – comprising an engine guard, rear chassis guard, mid-section shield and rear undertray. An entirely new exhaust system has been developed with side-exit.

These adaptations help to protect the chassis and important components from damage when driving in extreme conditions.

Other additions include a BMW X-Drive electronic differential to modulate the power to the rear wheels, with three driving modes - Road, All-Terrain and All-Terrain Extreme.

The latter fully locks the rear differential, providing equal torque to both rear wheels.

It has a sliding track mounted into to the dashboard to allow the secure fixing of a variety of devices such as phones or cameras. There's also a flexible map light, pencil and notebook holder, just in case customers want to get the full rally raid experience.

Cabin stowage has also been optimised with the addition of a removable map holder and insulated cool bag, both located in the passenger footwell.

A custom-made first aid kit is mounted to the internal roll cage behind the seats.

While it is like nothing we've seen in a Morgan sales brochure before, it does hark back to Morgan's history of competing in all-terrain endurance trials going back more than a century

As early as 1911, Morgan sports cars were competing and winning in off-road competitions

Lightweight, powerful and featuring capable suspension, Morgans were seen as the ideal weapon to take on tough rally routes

While Morgan has never produced an off-road focussed model to sell to customers, it says there has been huge demand for a car of this type from enthusiasts and collectors

Just like the exterior equipment, every interior feature has been designed with accessibility and convenience in mind, whether this is for use in remote conditions or a driver is circumnavigating the M25.

The cabin is enclosed within a one-off composite hard top unique to the Plus Four CX-T, which is intricately engineered to fit between the internal and external roll cages.

Commenting on the modifications made to the Morgan, Mike Jones from Rally Raid UK, said: 'Applying my experience of 13 Dakar Rallies, 60 Dakar vehicle builds and a lifetime of overland adventuring to an unconventional sports car such as a Morgan has been an interesting and rewarding project.

'Having the opportunity to design a car for such a prestigious marque has been a responsibility that I never imagined I would have.

'Rally Raid UK and Morgan have engaged with industry-leading suppliers to source the highest quality components, as well as designing a range of bespoke parts that will remain unique to the model.

'The Morgan Plus Four CX-T is a genuine overland adventure vehicle and I look forward to seeing the incredible destinations that owners will find themselves in.'

Additional luggage space comes in the form of external satchels that strap onto the external crash bars

Customers will be able to visit the Malvern factory to specify the exact details of the cars they order. Each of the 8 models will be signed off by Rally Raid UK, which has partnered with Morgan on the project. It is based on Huddersfield, making this a UK developed and built car

D.J. writes: My 84-year-old disabled wife needed a tooth extraction, which was carried out at Mydentist.

Following this, she suffered pain and returned to the practice where she discovered the dentist had also removed the cap on the tooth next to the one extracted, exposing the root. A new dentist said she needed a root removal at hospital, but because of lockdown this took six months to arrange.

She then went back to Mydentist to replace the capped tooth, only to be told the original dentist had left the country, and she now faces costs of over £2,000 for repair work.

Cover: All dentists are required to have insurance in case there are problems

Tony Hetherington replies: You have told me that when you asked whether the missing dentist was insured against making dental problems worse instead of better, Mydentist replied that it did not have records of his insurance cover. You also gained the impression that Mydentist, which has branches all over the country, does not actually employ its dentists but simply provides premises and equipment.

Armed with a legally binding consent letter from your wife, allowing the company to discuss her treatment, I approached IDH Group Limited, the Manchester business behind the Mydentist chain. But extracting information was a bit like, well, pulling teeth from an unwilling patient.

Mydentist refused point blank to talk about your wife. It told me: 'Unfortunately, we are unable to share specific details about a patient's treatment or dental history, even with their consent.' The company later conceded that it would share those details if you hired a solicitor to do battle with it, but there was no way it would talk to me.

It did tell me that under General Dental Council rules, all dentists are required to have their own indemnity insurance and are personally responsible for the treatment they provide. And it added that it was not correct to say that the company does not employ its dentists, and simply rents out premises.

So does this mean that Mydentist employs all the dentists at its branches? Actually no, it does not. It finally told me it has both employed and self-employed dentists. So where does this leave your wife and her hope that she could claim under the missing dentist's insurance policy?

Mydentist sidestepped the issue of whether its departed dentist was properly insured, but after a lot of pressure it issued a statement, saying: 'We have thoroughly investigated this issue and want to ensure the patient's concerns are quickly addressed. As a gesture of goodwill, we will therefore be completing the patient's current course of treatment at the practice at no extra cost.'

Since Mydentist refuses to talk about what went wrong with your wife's original extraction, or about her current treatment, I have to assume that her latest spell in the dentist's chair is aimed at putting right whatever went wrong so many months ago, and that she will not be charged for this. If any of this is wrong, please tell me and I shall be glad to return to the problem in print, no matter how much Mydentist squirms and tries to hide what really happened.

What's the point of this Utility?

R.S. writes: My gas and electricity accounts were switched from Utility Point to a cheaper company while the accounts were £607 in credit.

Utility Point said I would be refunded within ten days, but no refund came. I contacted the firm again and was told payment was not possible as it was inundated with refund requests.

Twice since then I have received the same reply.

Tony Hetherington replies: I asked Utility Point to comment, hoping for an explanation as to why it was too busy to handle refund claims. I was told to expect a response within seven working days, but none came.

However, when I told Utility Point we would be going ahead with publication of your complaint, it suddenly burst into life, telling you (rather than me): 'We sincerely apologise for the delay in issuing your refund; this is due to a large influx of refund requests which the finance department are working through as quickly as possible.'

A fortnight later the refund landed in your bank account, together with an extra £30 to make up for the delay. Bad customer relations, followed by bad press relations, do make me wonder about the company's management.

WE'RE WATCHING YOU The Financial Conduct Authority hopes to have squeezed a further £25million out of Toby Scott Whittaker, the man behind the collapsed Park First scheme which sold car park spaces to 4,500 investors. The watchdog has already secured £33million from the sale of the company's car park at Luton Airport, but even if the latest deal with Whittaker is honoured in full, investors will still be left well out of pocket. Victims of the scheme, which the FCA has condemned as illegal, have lodged claims for around £150million, but sources close to the scandal say total losses may well exceed £200million. Action: Toby Scott Whittaker whose victims are claiming £150million Sales of the car park spaces began in about 2014, with investors told to expect yields of ten to 12 per cent. The FCA ruled that it was actually a collective investment scheme, similar to a unit trust, and was being operated without the regulator's approval, which is a criminal offence. The watchdog also claims that marketing material included 'false or misleading statements'. Penalties for operating an unauthorised investment scheme can be up to two years in prison. But in 2017, the FCA decided not to prosecute the promoters if they allowed investors to reclaim their money or switch to a similar but legal contract which the FCA and Park First put together. And in what Park First admitted to me was a secret agreement, the watchdog allowed the company to delay refunds as long as it could. The business collapsed into administration in 2019 after failing to keep pace with demands for refunds. Investors will now be asked to approve a company voluntary arrangement, allowing Whittaker to pay £25million in instalments. If they approve, Whittaker and fellow director John Slater will admit they acted illegally. If investors reject the deal, the FCA plans to go to court next year, seeking compensation for investors. But there are no plans to prosecute anyone.

Dispute: The Chartwell Plaza development in Southend, Essex

Ms L.O. writes: I looked for properties online and found a flat in the Chartwell Plaza development in Southend. As I have a dog, I twice asked the agent if dogs were allowed. He told me that although dogs were not allowed in the main tower, they were allowed in part of the building called the 'annex' where I was buying a flat, so there was no problem.

I paid £22,000 as a deposit to Prosperity Wealth & Developments Limited. Now I have received a report on title which says that in fact no animals are allowed without prior consent which can be revoked at any time.

However, the company says if I do not go ahead with the purchase I will lose my £22,000 deposit.

Tony Hetherington replies: This really is a case of shifting the goalposts, big time. Even if you were given permission to bring your dog with you when you moved into the flat, the permission could be withdrawn later, leaving you with a choice of finding a new home at short notice or getting rid of your pet.

The good news though, is that the goalposts are pretty firmly rooted. A major factor in your decision to buy the flat was the assurance that your dog could live there too. You would not have signed the reservation form or parted with £22,000 if you had been given the real facts, and because of this, Prosperity Wealth & Developments cannot keep a penny of your £22,000.

So, this was an open and shut case. Almost. After I approached Birmingham-based Prosperity Wealth, it took just 24 hours for the company to tell me that it knew you wanted your dog to join you in your new home.

Staff explained: 'We sought permission from the freeholder and unfortunately, as we suspected, were told this was not approved.'

The sales agent disputes telling you that your dog would be allowed in the annex, but Prosperity Wealth appeared to accept that it is unlikely you would have bought a new home if part of the price was having to get rid of your dog. The company told me it had decided after all to give you a full refund of your £22,000.

You were pleased. I was pleased. And Prosperity Wealth had won itself a pat on the back on this page. But this is where the company bizarrely managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

Without telling me, it refused to repay your deposit unless you first did your best to stop me reporting what had happened.

In a series of messages, Prosperity Wealth told you: 'We will need communication that the article will be cancelled.' You explained that this was outside your control, and you asked: 'Does the refund depend on the article not being published by Mr Hetherington?'

Prosperity Wealth told you: 'We need to see evidence that you have communicated with him and confirmed the case has been resolved, and you do not wish your statement to be published.

'Once we have seen this confirmation, we will be able to process the refund.'

So, you let me know what was going on, and I agreed you could send me the demands made by Prosperity Wealth, and let the company have a copy. A day later, the £22,000 landed back in your bank account. But what a stupid decision by the Birmingham business to turn what would have been a small report showing it had treated a customer fairly, into a bigger story of how it threatened to keep your cash unless you tried to censor The Mail on Sunday.

Virgin's delay on £402 cashback

L.F. writes: Virgin Holidays were offering cashback for bookings made via the Top Cashback website.

I booked for myself, my wife and two friends, and should have received £402 in cashback.

I paid the balance due and we took the holiday months ago, but Virgin has still failed to pay the cashback.

Waiting game: Virgin Holidays were offering cashback for bookings made via the Top Cashback website

Tony Hetherington replies: This is not a straightforward scheme. In fact, it has been confusing from the start. Top Cashback said it could not pay you because Virgin had not paid it. However, Virgin told me it was fully committed to honouring the deal, but added: 'We have only very recently received an invoice from Conversant.'

Neither you nor I had heard of Conversant, but Virgin described it as a 'supplier which works with Top Cashback'. So far, so good. But then Top Cashback told you it no longer works with Virgin Holidays, and suggested you should not contact Virgin as its staff might not understand how the scheme operates.

I found this easy to believe as I was getting confused myself, particularly when Top Cashback told me 'the network's tracking registered wrong'. What does this mean? Well, Top Cashback told me: 'Conversant owns CJ who are the affiliate network involved.' It is also 'the tracking platform'!

By then, many weeks had passed since Virgin told me it had paid the invoice. Finally, Top Cashback promised payment within five days, and at last the £402 arrived. You worked hard for months for this money, so you truly earned it.

Why did I receive a £6,000 cheque for PPI I never had?

D.M. writes: I received a letter saying I had been named as executor in the estate of someone bearing my surname. The letter asked that any cheques I received should be forwarded to the writer.

I knew that the deceased was not a relative of mine, so I returned the letter without noting the details. However, two weeks later a letter arrived from Black Horse Ltd, part of Lloyds Bank, with a cheque for £5,937.

This is supposedly the result of a PPI claim, yet I have never even had payment protection insurance.

Tony Hetherington replies: You tore the cheque into pieces which you sent to me with your letter. My first thought was that the cheque was fake, but might be accepted by your bank long enough for the £5,937 to appear in your account. Then you would receive an apologetic phone call, asking you to transfer the money elsewhere. And finally, when Lloyds bounced the cheque, your own bank would cancel the credit from your account, leaving you £5,937 out of pocket.

But I was wrong. The cheque you ripped up was genuine. Helpful staff at Lloyds went back through their records and found that a firm of solicitors had submitted a PPI claim on behalf of the estate of a deceased client. It was the solicitors who for unknown reasons named you as the executor.

Although it was not directly the bank's fault, Lloyds has sent you £100 by way of saying sorry for wasting your time.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I'm a leaseholder living in a purpose-built apartment, and the service charge I pay rises by about 10 per cent each year.

Some of the costs I am being billed for seem inflated. For example, I noticed that the buildings insurance, which is included as part of the service charge, increased by over 25 per cent in our latest annual bill, which does not make any sense.

The management company's excuses are nothing but jargon. It blames the rising costs on Covid-19, and 'key fundamentals'.

Asked about the insurance, it said 'several factors have significantly contributed to the increase charged by the insurance market' - but it won't disclose what these are.

To add insult to injury, myself and my fellow resident leaseholders feel totally neglected. It sometimes takes months for simple issues to be fixed.

For example, it took them over one year to fix the lift. Of course Covid-19 was once again to blame. I'm also absolutely certain the apartment windows have not been cleaned in all the eight years I have lived here - they are absolutely filthy.

What can we the leaseholders do to take back control? Is there a way to challenge the escalating costs? And is there a way can we change our managing agent? Via email

Government figures estimate there to be around 4.5 million leasehold homes in England alone, of which 69 per cent are flats and 31 per cent are houses

Ed Magnus of This is Money replies: I'm sorry to hear of your troubles with your managing agent, and of the spiralling costs you are being subjected to.

Leaseholders can sometimes feel powerless when it comes to the management and upkeep of the buildings they live in.

More than a quarter of leaseholders have complained about the high cost of works and management fees, according to a survey by the HomeOwners Alliance.

Unlike freeholders, leaseholders do not own the land their properties are built on. Instead, they rent it on a lease which lasts a number of years - usually at least 99.

Whilst maintaining the flat itself is typically the leaseholder's responsibility, the building itself and any communal areas often fall on the freeholder, who will in turn often appoint a managing agent to do so on their behalf.

Most leaseholders, particularly those in purpose-built apartment blocks, will have a service charge to pay, which goes towards the upkeep of the building and any communal areas.

The lease should always set out the way the service charge is organised and what fees can be charged.

It often includes the costs of buildings insurance, cleaning, gardening, repairs of communal areas, surveyors fees, fire risk assessments and managing agents fees, among others.

One in five leaseholders objected to unfair service charges and 23 per cent reported they had a lack of control over which major works are done, according to the HomeOwners Alliance

If you pay a service charge, you have the right to ask for a summary showing how the charge is worked out and what it's spent on, as well as any paperwork supporting the summary, such as receipts.

The freeholder or managing agent must give the leaseholder this information, and it's a criminal offence if they don't.

The managing agent will usually be responsible for insuring the building - not including the contents - and this will often be part of your service charge, although it is sometimes kept separate.

You may be able to apply to a tribunal if you pay a service charge and you think it's unreasonable or that work is poorly done.

However, be aware that the freeholder or management company can also take you to court if you stop paying the service charge.

When it comes to the neglect you feel you and your fellow leaseholders are enduring, you may be able to change the management of your building if you're unhappy with the way it's being run.

To do this, you can either ask a tribunal to appoint a new manager, or take over the management responsibilities, known as your 'right to manage.'

The freeholder can also apply to the tribunal to challenge your notice to set up a 'right to manage' company.

For example, the building may not eligible for the right to manage, because more than 25 per cent is non-residential, or less than two-thirds of the flats are owned by qualifying leaseholders.

But if there are many leaseholders in the building, managing it yourselves may prove impractical and you may be better off appointing a new managing agent.

To appoint a new manager, you must prove bad management.

Demonstrating that you have to pay unreasonable service charges or that the landlord has not complied with an approved code of management practice might be sufficient.

We spoke to Kevin Lever, a partner at KDL Law, and Dona Awano, a member of the Law Society's conveyancing and land law committee, to help answer your questions.

Is a yearly 10 per cent rise in service charge normal?

Kevin Lever replies: Service charges will tend to increase year-on-year like most expenses in life.

Whether 10 per cent is reasonable or unreasonable will depend on numerous specific issues.

What about the 25 per cent jump in the building's insurance premium?

Kevin Lever replies: The property management experts that we talk to are saying that insurance premiums have been increasing over the past two years, and rises of this nature are not uncommon.

The 25 per cent increase on the block in question is likely being driven by a number of major factors.

First, insurers are considering the greater risks highlighted by the Grenfell fire and cladding, as well as other fire protection measures now required.

Second, the cost of claims has increased during the pandemic as there has been a significant rise in the cost of building materials thanks to supply shortages, not helped by the increased demand over the last 18 months as more people have renovated their homes.

Third, there have been more claims made during the pandemic, presumably because more people were at home for more of the time over the last 18 months and thus more mishaps occurred in the home.

What about challenging the managing agent?

Kevin Lever replies: The level of service a landlord or managing agent must provide is dependent upon the provisions in the lease.

Leases will often require that a landlord must clean the flat windows, but some don't, so it's always worth checking the lease.

Poor service by the managing agent is an issue that should be taken up politely with the agent in the first instance.

All residential property managing agents are required to provide you with details of the consumer redress scheme of which they are members, and to have a formal complaints process for you to follow.

Leasehold let-down: Hefty service charges and unsatisfactory explanations for cost increases are causing a headache for this homeowner

If your complaint to the managing agent does not provide a satisfactory outcome, then you should refer the matter to the relevant redress scheme. They will make a ruling on your complaint and may award compensation if appropriate.

It would be wise to seek advice before raising your complaint, as whilst the agent is the face of the landlord and may be responsible for any poor service, your complaint might in fact be about matters to be addressed to the landlord and thus beyond the scope of the redress scheme.

In this case, you may need to make an application to the First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber).

It will assess whether the service charge is reasonable and judge whether the landlord has failed to fulfil their obligations under the lease.

If we ask a tribunal to appoint a new manager, what evidence is required?

Dona Awano replies: The appointment of a manager is a fault-based remedy, so the leaseholders must be able to prove that the landlord, or their managing agent, are in breach of their repair or maintenance obligations under the lease.

Advice from the HomeOwners Alliance By chief executive Paula Higgins When it comes to insurance, managing agents should shop around for at least 3 quotes. Managing agents sometimes receive a referral fee with a particular insurer, so we would suggest you ask the agent directly whether they receive a referral fee and what it is. It is worth looking into getting the right to manage - the process is straightforward, but you do need to get 50 per cent of the leaseholders on board. Make sure you instruct a leasehold specialist lawyer who is a member of the Association of Leasehold Enfranchisement Practicioners. The other option is to ask your freeholder to sell you the freehold, and you might even be eligible to demand that they sell it to you.

Alternatively, you need to show that the managing agent is charging excessive service charges or administration charges, or that they have failed to comply with an approved code of good practice.

The leaseholder will also need to shop around to find a professional managing agent who is willing to take on the management of the building, and who they can nominate to the tribunal.

If an order appointing a manager is made, it's only for a limited period of time - though there is an option to make a further appointment to extend the order if necessary.

Is the 'right to manage' a credible option?

Dona Awano replies: There are a number of requirements for both the building and the leaseholders which have to be satisfied.

For example, at least 50 per cent of the flats in the building must participate in the process.

No fault needs to be proved prior to exercising the right, but the landlord still remains the freeholder of the building - they would just no longer have the right to maintain the building or to demand and collect service charges.

An alternative is to buy the freehold collectively, with each leaseholder owning a share.

With this, the qualifying requirements are the same as for the right to manage.

Are there any regulatory changes afoot that will help leaseholders in the future?

Dona Awano replies: In 2019, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government published recommendations on how property agents, estate agents and letting agents are managed, with the aim being to regulate them - although there is no legislation on this issue yet.

We understand that the Law Commission, the MHCLG and the Regulation of Property Agents working group are trying to improve the situation for future leaseholders, but it won't solve the immediate problem.

We also understand that the Law Commission is preparing legislation to come to parliament which will make it quicker and cheaper to buy the freehold of blocks, so these service charge issues don't arise.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The mortgage battle led rates to continue their downward slide this week, with multiple deals now available at less than 0.9 per cent interest.

Halifax launched the lowest two-year fixed rate ever seen at just 0.83 per cent on Monday, and now HSBC has responded with the lowest rate in its own history at 0.89 per cent.

The two-year fixed rate incurs a £999 arrangement fee and, as with most of the ultra-low interest deals currently on the market, is only available to home movers or those remortgaging with at least a 40 per cent deposit or equity.

This has led to questions over how much further rates can fall. Brokers are divided on the answer, with some suggesting they could go to 0.5 per cent and others saying they won't go much lower. We take a look at the market and speak to the experts.

Bottoming out? Mortgage rates are hitting historic lows of less than 0.90 per cent

Two-year deals are the lowest rate battleground, with those 0.83 per cent and 0.89 per cent deals on offer, but many borrowers are increasingly attracted by the idea of fixing for five years.

HSBC also launched a sub-1 per cent deal on a five-year fixed rate for such borrowers, at 0.99 per cent with a £999 fee.

With rates so low, those coming to the end of a fixed-rate term should be able to secure a competitive deal, provided they have a substantial deposit and a good credit rating.

Brokers say that, in some circumstances, it may even be worth customers exiting a fixed-term mortgage early and paying the early repayment penalty in order to snap up a super-low rate.

But the lowest rates don't always represent the best deal, as they often come with hefty arrangement fees.

This is Money explains what borrowers need to know about rates across the market right now, and what to check if they are considering a mortgage switch.

Why are rates so low?

Banks and building societies are awash with cash to lend, as middle-class savers paid in huge amounts during the pandemic when they couldn't spend on going out or holidays. Most savers are earning pitiful interest on it, generating a cheap funding opportunity for lenders.

Lenders are also competing with each other for new customers, as they shrug off fears of house price falls and instead chase the boom in purchases seen during the pandemic. Some are keen to grab business now for fear appetite for borrowing may fall away after the stamp duty holiday was tapered down at the end of June.

'This is being exacerbated by the transaction cliff-edge at the end of the stamp duty holiday, which prompted many to go through sooner,' says Matt Coulson, director at Heron Financial. 'Banks want your business and will be making decisions to win it.'

HSBC is the latest lender to launch an extremely low-interest deal, offering a two-year fixed rate of just 0.89 per cent. However, it is only available to those with 40 per cent deposits

The Bank of England base rate is also sitting at a historic low of 0.1 per cent, and set to stay that way for some time.

While mortgage rates are not tied to the base rate, they usually rise and fall with it, as it dictates the cost at which banks can borrow money.

Finally, banks are keen to get more low-risk business on their books by lending to those with bigger deposits.

This effectively balances out the riskier 5 per cent deposit mortgages they have been offering - with substantially higher interest rates - at the other end of the scale.

Not all can grab a super-low rate but some go sub-1%

Though interest rates are falling across the board, they still vary widely across the market.

While those with 40 per cent deposits are getting very cheap deals, first-time buyers with just 5 per cent to put down can still pay interest rates as high as 4 per cent, for example.





Below if roughly how the best deals break down outside the 20 per cent-plus deposit or equity bracket.

20 - 30 per cent deposits

While not as low as those with 40 per cent deposits, mortgages for those with 25 or 30 per cent deposits are now edging closer to the sub-1 per cent bracket.

Platform is the only lender to have gone sub-1 per cent for those with 25 per cent deposits so far, offering a two-year fixed rate of 0.99 per cent with a hefty £1,249 fee.

HSBC also launched a five-year fix for those with 25 per cent deposits at 1.19 per cent with a £999 fee – the lowest rate available on those terms.

At the 20 per cent deposit level, the lowest rate available is Platform's 1.49 per cent with a £749 fee on a two-year fix, while the cheapest fee-free option is Marsden BS's 1.85 per cent.

Those with 25 or 30 per cent deposits to put down could now find that they have access to rates less than 1 per cent, though most come with large arrangement fees

5-15 per cent deposits

If you have a 15 per cent deposit then you will still get a highly competitive rate, albeit some way off the best.

Rates jump significantly for those with deposits of 10 per cent, typically first-time buyers.

Halifax has the lowest rate on a two-year fix at 2.19 per cent, though with a £1,199 fee. The cheapest fee-free option is NatWest's 2.48 per cent on a two-year fix.

Those with smaller deposits wanting to fix for longer will need to pay closer to 3 per cent interest, but this could be worth it as they won't need to pay the costs of switching again in two years' time.

The lowest rate available for a 10 per cent deposit on a five-year fix is HSBC's 2.79 per cent with a £999 fee, while the cheapest fee-free deal is Atom Bank's 2.99 per cent, which also comes with £500 cashback.

Five per cent deposit borrowers will need to pay over 3 per cent interest.

Atom Bank offers the lowest two-year fixed rate at 3.09 per cent with a £900 fee, and also a fee-free deal with 3.39 per cent interest and £500 cashback.

Beware: Fees can cancel out an ultra-cheap rate

As the above examples show, all of the attention-grabbing low-interest deals charge significant arrangement fees - so these need to be factored in to the total cost of the mortgage.

Once borrowers add the fee in to their monthly payment, the deal may not be as cheap as it first seemed.

Don't use the low rate as a bragging right, as that could hit your back pocket hard

'What people need to bear in mind is the lowest headline rate deals aren't always the best deals,' says Paul Neal of brokers Missing Element Mortgage Services.

'Most have a product fee added, which can be up to £1,499, making a 1 per cent-plus mortgage product the cheaper option.

'We would always recommend you seek advice and don't use the low rate as a bragging right, as that could hit your back pocket hard.'

Count the cost: Arrangement fees get lower if the borrowers pays a higher interest rate

There are also broker's fees and valuation costs to consider in some cases. For example, Halifax's super-low 0.83 per cent rate is only available via selected brokers, who may or may not charge a fee.

Halifax also charges for a basic valuation - one of the only large lenders to do so.

'The Halifax are about the only high street lender still charging for a basic valuation, which means that for many people the cheapest deal overall often lies elsewhere,' says Rhys Schofield, managing director at Peak Mortgages and Protection.

Cheapest two-year fixed mortgages on £300,000 home with 40% deposit Provider Interest rate Fee Annual cost Barclays 1.12% £0 £8,258 Platform 1.26% £0 (£250 cashback) £8,272 Nationwide 1.14% £0 £8,454 NatWest 0.94% £745 £8,454 HSBC 0.89% £999 £8,533 Nationwide 0.94% £999 £8,581 Halifax 0.87% £1,199 £8,613 Barclays 0.92% £1,249 £8,687 Halifax 0.83% £1,499 £8,725

To illustrate how fees can affect the overall cost of a mortgage, we took the example of a borrower buying a £300,000 home with a 40 per cent deposit of £120,000, so a total mortgage amount of £180,000.

On Halifax's 0.83 per cent interest mortgage, they would pay £8,725 per year on a two-year fixed term.

But if they took Halifax's slightly higher-interest deal at 0.87 per cent, they would actually pay less per year at £8,613, because the deal has a lower arrangement fee.

Raymond Boulger, senior mortgage technical manager at broker John Charcol, says: 'Halifax's 0.83 per cent, two-year fix will only be the cheapest deal for anyone borrowing at least £600,000.

Halifax's 0.83 per cent mortgage will only be the cheapest deal for anyone borrowing at least £600,000 Raymond Boulger, John Charcol

'Those borrowing less than who want a two-year fixed rate would be better off with an alternative two-year fix from Halifax which has a rate of 0.87 per cent, but a fee of £999.'

The total annual cost could be even lower if they chose a deal with no upfront fee. By doing this, the borrower in our example could save more than £450 a year compared to Halifax's super-low deal.

Whether or not a higher-interest deal would save a buyer money depends on the amount of their mortgage, so it is important to check based on individual circumstances.

This can be done using our true cost mortgage calculator, while our mortgage comparison service, powered by L&C, also shows total cost over deal term taking fees into account.

We also examined the annual costs for a buyer purchasing the same £300,000 home with a 25 per cent deposit, again on a two-year fixed term.

Again, the lowest-interest mortgage - Platform's 0.99 per cent product - came out the highest based on the annual cost.

The buyer would be £130 per year better off if they chose HSBC's mortgage at a much higher interest rate with no upfront fee.

Will rates stay low and should borrowers hold out?

With rates changing so quickly, mortgage borrowers considering a switch will want to know two things: how low rates could potentially go, and when the tide will turn and they will begin to rise.

Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to either of these questions.

This is Money asked mortgage brokers how low they thought rates could go, and there was little consensus.

In a quick straw poll, almost half said they thought that rates for those with lots of equity would bottom out at between 0.75 and 0.79 per cent, just slightly lower than where they are now.

Buying spree: The pandemic housing boom has helped to lower rates, but brokers admit there is no knowing how long these cheap mortgage deals will stick around for

However, almost a third said they would fall to 0.69 per cent or lower, with one even predicting that they could go as low as 0.5 per cent.

In the more conservative camp is Hina Bhudia, partner at Knight Frank Finance.

'It may be the case that we see some more very marginal cuts, but 0.83 per cent or thereabouts is likely to be as low - or close to as low - as they'll go in this cycle,' she says. 'For buyers that qualify, now is the time to lock that rate in.'

Bhudia says that the next round of cuts will benefit those with smaller deposits, instead of driving rates even lower for the equity-rich.

This means those customers may do well to hold out, rather than switching deals now.

'Rather than rates dropping much further from some of these all-time lows, we expect more movement to take place at higher loan-to-value ratios over the coming months – that will be a boon for buyers that were overlooked during the pandemic, particularly first-time buyers.'

Other brokers envision rates for 40 per cent deposit borrowers dropping far lower than the current 0.83 per cent floor.

'With so many lenders consistently improving their pricing to offer super-cheap rates I would not bet against a lender offering a 0.5 per cent fix soon,' says Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial.

Ultimately, it is a call for borrowers to make. 'How long they stay [at this level] is anyone's guess, and if someone tells you they know, they're lying,' says Lewis Shaw of Shaw Financial Services.

And everything must be viewed in context. Even if rates did drop lower, 0.83 per cent still represents a historical low, and much less than homeowners who took out their loans pre-pandemic are currently paying.

Is it worth exiting early - and paying the penalty - to bag a low rate? For borrowers on their mortgage lender's standard variable rate - the higher 'default' rate that homeowners drop on to after their fixed deal ends, currently around 3 to 4 per cent for most lenders - there will be no exit fee, so switching makes sense. But for those already tied into a two- or five-year fixed rate, there is still a chance they could save money by switching to one of the new low-interest deals, even if they did have to pay an early repayment charge to exit their current deal. 'Recently we have seen clients who have benefited from paying the early redemption charge on their existing mortgage as the new rate is so much better,' says Matt Coulson, director at broker Heron Financial. This depends on your individual circumstances, however, so checking early repayment charges and carefully calculating monthly payments, fees and compound interest - or getting a broker to do it for you - is vital.

Speaking to a broker could help homeowners establish whether choosing a five-year fix on today's interest rates could save them money in the long term

Should borrowers consider a five-year fix?

Two-year fixed rates are the most popular with UK mortgage borrowers, with many preferring the flexibility that they offer in case they need to move house, for example.

But for those who are confident they will be staying put, now could be the time to consider a longer fix.

Not only could they lock in a low rate for longer on a five-year fix, but they would also avoid paying fees again when they remortgaged in two years' time.

Says Boulger: 'The difference between rates fixed for two and five years is small and borrowers need to consider carefully whether a longer term fix, say for 5 years, would suit them better.

'For example for mortgages with 40 per cent deposits or more, the monthly cost on a £200,000, 25 year repayment mortgage at 0.99 per cent is £753 per month, whereas a two-year fix at 0.83 per cent would cost £738.

'The saving with the two year fix of £15 per month over two years is £360, whereas the fees to switch to another deal in two years time are likely to be more than that.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's biggest accountancy firm PwC has seen its profits surge over the past year thanks to the boom in deals.

Partners will receive an average payment of £818,000 for the year to the end of June, plus a sum of around £50,000 relating to one-off items, including the sale of its tech platform.

That was up from £685,000 in 2021 and a pre-Covid £765,000 in 2019. Profit for the financial year rose 25 per cent, to £1.17billion.

Partners at PWC will receive an average payment of £818,000 for the year to the end of June, plus a sum of around £50,000 relating to one-off items, including the sale of its tech platform

Just under 940 of PwC's 22,000 staff in the UK have achieved the coveted status of partner. Their individual rewards vary widely according to their seniority, performance and how much business they bring in.

The firm, led by senior partner and chairman Kevin Ellis, also paid out more in rewards to other staff. Its UK bonus pot was increased to a record £128million, from £113million before the virus struck, plus an extra week's pay in May.

PwC continued to hire throughout the pandemic and the lockdowns, taking on 3,300 new joiners.

The performance was fuelled by strong growth in deals revenue, which rose by 9 per cent to £854million.

The UK has seen record takeovers and mergers so far this year, leading to rising demand for professional services and advice.

'It is a deals-led recovery,' said Ellis. 'The deal level is mind-blowing.'

Buoyant demand for professional services is likely to continue, driven by deal-making. Firms are also seeking advice as they move faster towards digitisation due to the pandemic and as they try to address climate change.

Many are recalibrating their business models as 'just-in-time' supply chains, based on low-cost international sourcing, have come under strain because of Covid.

'Like our clients, we see the pandemic recovery as a catalyst of profound change, driving increased demand for our deals, financing, digitisation, ESG and supply chain transformation services,' said Ellis.

He added that the UK needs to embark on a 'massive retraining exercise' involving government, the education sector and businesses, to ensure workers have the skills they need for the economy of the future.

Ellis last month sparked a national debate on working from home after he told the Daily Mail being away from the office too much will blight the careers of young professionals as they will miss out on camaraderie and the opportunity to learn from their seniors.

Rishi Sunak weighed in by saying he doubted he would have done so well if he had begun is working life from home, using Teams or Zoom.

The Chancellor added that it is 'valuable' for young people in particular to be physically in the office.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vectura's board faces a tough decision over the inhaler maker's future as they weigh up offers from a cigarette giant and a private equity firm.

Marlboro-maker Philip Morris International (PMI) and Carlyle both want the Wiltshire company.

The pair have been outbidding one another for months and this week almost went head-to-head in a rare auction process.

Bidding battle: UK inhaler maker Vectura is being pursued by Marlboro-maker Philip Morris International and private equity firm Carlyle

Carlyle withdrew before it had started by declaring its bid of £958million, or 155p per share, final. PMI's most recent bid stands at £1.02billion, or 165p, and puts it in pole position to take over.

Yesterday, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Vectura's board 'must exercise their duty of care to all stakeholders, resist Philip Morris, and say they don't want to be bought by Big Tobacco'.

Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets, said: 'These bids are a problem. The best place for the company to grow is in the public markets.

'It is now a choice for the Vectura board between the devil and the deep blue sea. Investors who wanted to stick long term with Vectura have been done over.'

PMI wants Vectura's tech to turn itself into a 'healthcare and wellness' firm. It has pledged to use its global reach to help Vectura sell its products.

But campaigners are sceptical about PMI's motives. Malcolm Clark, senior cancer prevention policy manager at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Becoming tobacco-owned would also threaten the vital work done by Vectura.'

Nicholas Hopkinson, chairman of Action on Smoking and Health, added: 'From a financial point of view it may be the highest offer but it will kill the company.'

Others view private equity giant Carlyle as worse, saying Vectura could be asset stripped and sold again. But Vectura's board has hinted it agrees with those taking an ethical health stand.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The John Lewis Partnership has announced it will create another 500 jobs to help fulfil the increasing growth in digital sales to its customers.

It has agreed a deal with Tesco to lease a one million square foot distribution centre at Fenny Lock in Milton Keynes for 11 years, from which it plans to start operating in two years' time.

Located just four miles from its largest warehouse in Magna Park, which is double the size, the site will stock fashion, small home furnishing and technology items.

The news follows the company declaring around 4,000 job cuts in the face of the coronavirus downturn, including 1,000 jobs last month as part of a shake-up of its store management, as it shuts several stores and cancelled its famous bonus.

Job creation: The John Lewis Partnership will create another 500 jobs at a new warehouse

John Lewis has also confirmed another deal to lease a 300,000 sq ft logistics site in the Leicestershire village of Bardon, which will be operated by Clipper Logistics and be operational in time for the Black Friday shopping holiday later this year.

When the two become operational, it will mean the Waitrose owner has a total of 12 distribution centres across England, with half of them located in Milton Keynes and the remainder situated throughout the Midlands.

Andrew Murphy, the executive director of operations at the retailer, said the new Milton Keynes site 'represents a fantastic opportunity to power the continued growth of Johnlewis.com, ensuring that we can keep pace with customer demand - both for our products and for our wide range of fulfilment and delivery options.'

He added that the site's closeness to its Magna Park location would help it cut the number of packages it creates by one million per year, reduce lorry usage, and bring it closer to hitting its target of reaching net zero carbon by 2035.

The group intends to invest £50million this year in its website, app, and virtual events and services and £100million in total over five years towards its online platform.

Store closures have meant online orders at John Lewis have expanded from 40 per cent to more than 60 per cent since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Pandemic boost: In comparison to John Lewis's department store chain, its Waitrose division accelerated to record levels last year thanks to a surge in grocery sales

But this has come nowhere to making up for the massive loss in store purchases and high losses, including a £517million annual loss last year, the first yearly loss in its history.

British department store chains have been some of the worst casualties since the pandemic began. Debenhams fell into administration before being forced to closed all its remaining outlets.

By contrast, profits at Waitrose accelerated to record levels last year thanks to a surge in grocery sales and the decision by the supermarket not to hand back £85million in business rates relief and pay a bonus to staff.

To try and recover trade, John Lewis has launched an 'affordable' range called Anyday, which aims to attract a younger demographic, such as university freshers, first-time home buyers and renters.

It additionally introduced its first ever 'buy now, pay later' offer in response to the rise in interest free credit. Chairman Sharon White has said the partnership aims to have 40 per cent of its earnings derive from 'non-retail' by the end of the decade.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Increasing numbers of DIY investors are deciding to buy individual shares in their SIPPs and ISAs to grow their wealth, and well they might given the hugely democratising influence of the internet.

Information on companies has never been as easily accessible as it is today, which makes the job of picking good stocks something private investors can participate in, if they’re willing to put in the elbow grease to thoroughly research their potential purchases.

But what are the metrics and resources investors should turn to when selecting investments?

Retail investors must consider a range of metrics before selecting a stock to invest in

Probably the biggest store of valuable information for investors lies in the results and reports presented by companies to the stock market.

Institutional investors have no special treatment compared to private investors here; the results are delivered to the market as a whole at the same time, and for UK stocks can be found on the London Stock Exchange website at 7am each day, or on companies’ investor relations websites.

These reports are a treasure trove of information. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, picks some key things to look out for.

Earnings Per Share

One of the most important figures in company results is the Earnings Per Share (EPS) figure. This tells investors what profits the company is making for each share they hold.

There are two main ways to look at this figure. First, consider how it compares with prior periods to see if earnings are heading in the right direction, taking into account any one-off boosts or dents in profits that aren’t repeatable.

The Chief Executive’s commentary which goes along with the results should alert you to such factors, particularly the ‘outlook’, which looks ahead to the following year.

Second, divide the share price by the Earnings Per Share figure to derive the Price Earnings ratio, which is a measure of how expensive the shares are compared to the profits the company generates. Make sure you only use the annual Earnings Per Share figure in this calculation - you will get a wonky ratio if you use the earnings from a half year report because you’re only looking at part of the picture.

Alternatively, you can also get the Price Earnings ratio from other sources such as the websites of some investment platforms, brokers and media outlets. You might be willing to invest in companies with higher Price Earnings ratios if you think there are good prospects for those earnings to grow quickly.

Dividends

The dividend is another key figure in the reports and accounts for investors to mull, especially income seekers. Again, it’s a good idea to compare it with previous periods to see if the income payment to shareholders is growing.

It’s also worth comparing the dividend per share to the earnings per share and considering how big a proportion of profits are being paid out as dividends. If it’s a high percentage, it may be a sign that dividend growth is likely to be limited, or in extreme cases that the dividend is unsustainable.

You can also divide the dividend per share by the share price to derive the stock’s historic yield, which again is available on many investment websites free of charge.

Of course, there are some companies which don’t pay a dividend, preferring instead to reinvest profits in the business, and here this measure can’t be used. Big tech companies like Amazon and Alphabet are renowned for this growth-hungry approach which shuns dividends.

Profit margins

It's worth also looking at a firm’s profit margin. Usually this will be presented in the results, and it tells you what percentage of revenues flows through into profits, which ultimately determine a company’s performance.

A low profit margin means a company has little room for error or misfortune before slipping into the red, while a larger margin means the company is better placed to weather any storms while still turning a profit.

Bear in mind some industries simply have low margins, for instance supermarkets and construction. While it may be less of an issue for the former as consumer demand for groceries is relatively stable, construction projects can often run late or over budget, wiping out profits and leading to losses - precisely what happened to Carillion before it collapsed.

Debt

Investors should also pay heed to how much debt a company is carrying. In annual results, net debt is the key figure here. Again you can compare with previous periods to see if it’s heading in the wrong direction, which could be a warning sign.

You can also divide net debt by EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) as this figure is often provided in the results.

This ratio gives an indication of how many years it would take a company to pay off all its debt at current levels of profitability. Generally a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 2 is considered healthy, and a ratio above 3 starts to raise eyebrows.

Broker forecasts and ratings

There are plenty of other measures to look for in the results too, if you really want to roll your sleeves up, and also other resources you can use outside company reports which might help.

Laith Khalaf: Investors should give thought to portfolio diversification

For instance, on their investor relations websites, many large companies will provide the average of professional analysts’ estimates of earnings in the forthcoming year (known as the consensus estimate). This can give you an idea of market expectations for a stock, and in the short term, share price movements will be guided by how actual performance measures up to these forecasts.

Broker ratings are also available on many websites, which tell you whether analysts rate a company as a buy, hold or sell.

These don’t tend to be very useful however, as there are usually as many saying sell as there are hold or buy. And when there is clear analyst agreement on a stock, that’s usually baked into the price.

Overall you might want to look at analyst ratings and estimates to get an idea of how the market views a stock, but it shouldn’t play a major part in your investment decision. Analysts tend to focus heavily on the next twelve months, whereas investors should be thinking about becoming an owner of a company for five to ten years or more.

Portfolio diversification

As well as picking good companies to hold for the long term, investors should of course give some thought to portfolio diversification. If all the companies you select are in the same country, or in the same industry, then your portfolio will be extremely vulnerable to a downturn in those areas. So make sure you’ve got a good spread of investments.

You should also make sure there are enough companies in your portfolio to minimise the impact of one performing particularly poorly, or worse still, going bust.

As a rule of thumb, the professional fund managers with the most concentrated portfolios still have around 30 stocks in there. That probably sounds like quite a lot for most private investors, particularly seeing as you need to regularly review your holdings as well as picking them in the first place.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Slimmed-down Aviva has said it will return at least £4billion to shareholders by the end of next year, including £750million through share buybacks set to start immediately.

Aviva has been a beneficiary of the lockdown saving boom, which saw people stash more in their pensions and investments, with its savings and retirement division seeing 'record' inflows and assets under management rising 24 per cent to £141.billion.

The insurer, which sold eight overseas businesses over the past year to focus on its core markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada, also hiked its interim dividend by 5 per cent to 7.35p a share.

Aviva hailed its 'best start to the year in a decade' for its general insurance business

Chief executive Amanda Blanc, who has spearheaded the disposals' spree that raised £7.5billion, said the group had made 'good progress on all fronts' since the start of the overhaul.

'We are delivering on our commitment to make a substantial capital return to our shareholders,' Blanc added.

However, the payout unveiled today is less than the £5billion demanded by activist investor Cevian, which in June revealed it had acquired a 5 per cent stake in Aviva, becoming the insurer's second largest shareholder.

Cevian, known for demanding overhauls at other companies, including Pearson, has also asked for at least £500million of cost cuts by 2023 - higher than the £300million promised by Blanc.

Aviva announced the payouts along with its first half results, which show the company's adjusted operating profit rose 17 per cent to £725million.

Aviva also hailed its 'best start to the year in a decade' for its general insurance arm, helped by lower motor and travel claims.

Insurers are being boosted by fewer motor claims, as drivers have been on the road less due to lockdowns and working from home, though the pandemic has hit car cover premium rates.

General insurance gross written premiums rose 6 per cent to £4.4billion in the first half and life insurance new premiums rose 13 per cent to £16.9billion, Aviva said.

However, sales of annuities tumbled, which contributed to the company's profit figure missing expectations of £781million.

'The reason behind the weaker than forecast showing is weakness in the bulk annuity market – where pension schemes buy an insurance policy to cover future pensions and benefits due to be paid to its members,' said Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell.

'It helps when this bitter pill on profit is sweetened by a very chunky return of capital, though still short of what activist investor Cevian had been pushing for since it joined the register of shareholders in June.

'The presence of Cevian means there is little chance of Blanc resting on her laurels and they are likely,' he added.

Overhaul: Aviva chief executive Amanda Blanc said the group had made progress on all fronts

Aviva shares were up 3.5 per cent, or 14.10p, to 420.90p just after London market close on Thursday. They have risen by about 40 per cent over the past year, during which it sold eight businesses.

The sale of its Polish division in March marked the final stage in the huge sell-off programme, coming after it sold businesses in markets including France, Turkey, Italy, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Freetrade's analyst, David Kimberley, said: 'Today’s buyback announcement is obviously great for those looking to cash out but Aviva needs to strike a careful balance between paying down debt, reinvesting in itself, and providing a return to shareholders.

'Selling off isn’t just about getting rid of subsidiaries and returning the resulting funds to investors — the company also has to ensure it remains strong in the markets it still operates in.

'And here the early signs are positive. The growth the company has seen in Canada and the UK are the sorts of things that suggest the firm was right to narrow its focus. Of course, it's still early days and there’s a long way to go before we can say that’s definitively the case.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Transport Minister, Grant Shapps, announced this week that the Government has commissioned the Royal College of Art to design electric vehicle charging points that are 'as iconic and recognisable as the British phone box, London bus or black cab'.

With MPs under pressure to ramp-up the installation of public charging devices to match the boom in sales of EVs - and develop a suitable infrastructure ahead of the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 - the legendary art school's creation could be seen on our roadsides by 2022.

The Government wants a design that makes them easy for drivers to spot but also incorporate 'British designs of old that are recognised the world over'.

However, at the same time the announcement was made, a new trial in the capital has seen the introduction of a revolutionary near-invisible solution that proves there might be no need for permanent charging points and extra clutter at the roadside.

Chargepoints as 'iconic and recognisable as the British phone box, London bus or black cab': The Government announced this week that it has commissioned the Royal College of Art to come up with a standardised - but stand-out - design for public charging devices

The request for the design of an 'iconic' new device is intended to turn British EV charging points into landmarks, with the intention to reveal the final creation in the lead-up to November's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.

Shapps has handed responsibility for the devices to the Royal College of Art and PA Consulting, with the remit to create a shape that helps to raise awareness of the transition to electric vehicles.

'Excellent design plays a key role in supporting our transition to zero emission vehicles, which is why I want to see EV chargepoints that are as iconic and recognisable as the British phone box, London bus or black cab,' said the Secretary of State for Transport - who also happens to own an electric Tesla Model 3.

'With less than three months to go until COP26, we continue to put the UK at the forefront of the design, manufacture and use of zero emission vehicles and their charging infrastructure, as we build back greener and call on countries around the world to similarly accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.'

Clive Grinyer, head of service design at the Royal College of Art, said: 'This is an opportunity to support the design of a future icon that will be part of our national culture as we move towards a sustainable future.

'The RCA has been at the forefront of shaping our products, mobility and services for the last 180 years.

'We are delighted to be playing a role in the design of the total service experience to ensure a usable, beautiful and inclusive design that is an excellent experience for all.'

'Excellent design plays a key role in supporting our transition to zero emission vehicles, which is why I want to see EV chargepoints that are as iconic and recognisable as the British phone box, London bus or black cab,' the Secretary of State for Transport said

Mr Shapps is a proud owner of a Tesla Model 3, which would have set the Transport Minster back more than £40,000 - though he did purchase it shortly before slashing the Plug-in Car Grant earlier this year, meaning only EVs priced under £35,000 qualify for the £2,500 grant

Warwick Goodall, transport and net-zero mobility expert at PA, added: 'We know that excellent design has the power to dismantle barriers to growth and simplify the user experience, making the switch to electric vehicles more attractive, accessible, affordable and secure for drivers.

'We look forward to working together with the public and industry on a design framework that will accelerate the chargepoint rollout ambitions and bring to life the electric vehicle revolution on our streets.'

Forget an iconic design - an invisible one could be better

A trial of revolutionary new public chargepoints has began in the capital in the last fortnight - and it might be a better solution for our roads.

Five new on-street devices from Scottish start-up, Trojan Energy - not to be confused with the trojan computer virus - have been installed in Brent, as part of a 150-wide charger trial that will also take place in Camden in the next six months.

The chargepoints certainly don't fit the 'iconic British design' remit setout by Grant Shapps this week - that's because you won't be able to see them.

While Shapps wants instantly recognisable chargepoints, a trial already underway in London is testing completely invisible EV charging solutions

Instead of a fixed charging post, the Trojan Energy solution is a hardwearing mount that's fitted flush into the pavement.

It is flat and tough enough to walk or drive over, meaning they won't obscure the footpath as fixed charging devices do currently.

Those with access to the points are provided with their own charging 'lance' - a personal charge post they can slot into the mounting point when they need to top up the batteries in their EV.

Once the charging session has ended, the lance is removed and stored in the car again.

The aim is to alleviate the need for any additional roadside furniture, meaning our streets wouldn't be taken over by a mass of large charging devices when EVs become more mainstream.

Importantly, the system has been designed with input from Disability Rights UK to improve safety for all street users, with wheelchairs, pushchairs and mobility scooters able to run over the almost-flat charging mounts.

Electric vehicle owners will carry one of these charging lances in their car. When they need to boost the battery in the car, they can attach it to one of 15 mounts located in a network on one street

The concept has been developed by Scottish start-up, Trojan Energy. It is being trialled in Brent and Camden from September to March 2022

The first Trojan Energy chargers have been installed in Mortimer Road in the north-west London borough.

A small group of trial participants will carry out real-world testing of the prototype system to understand the benefits and where improvements can be made.

The full trial of 150 chargepoints across Brent and Camden will go live later in the year.

Each site can have up to 15 of the mounting points installed in parallel from one electricity network connection, with power distributed to that hub of chargers.

Across the two boroughs there will be ten sets of 15 chargers on six streets in total, with over 140 existing EV owners signed up to test the technology from next month until March 2022.

They will benefit from 25p per kilowatt of charging and will be provided with the lances for free.

Up to 15 of the device mounting points are installed in parallel on one street from a single electricity network connection, with power distributed to that hub of chargers

Ian Mackenzie, CEO of Trojan Energy, said: 'We can't wait to see the first driver reactions and hear their feedback so we can generate learnings for the wider project rollouts across Brent and Camden.'

Feedback from the first users 'has been great' as they are so convenient for them, the firm says.

The cost of installation of each hub of 15 chargers will depend on a number of factors, such as layouts, pavement materials and local conditions.

'Once we gain more experience we will release further details on this,' Trojan Energy says.

Commenting on the trial, Transport Minister Rachel Maclean said: 'Innovation is key to creating cleaner, greener local communities – not only in the capital, but right across the country.

'This project is a great example of how technology is being used to solve a real-world problem to ensure that our EV infrastructure fits in seamlessly in our local towns and cities.

'This is crucial as we build back greener and encourage more people to make the switch, which is why I'm delighted this government is backing its delivery.'

Other revolutionary chargepoints that don't add to street furniture

The Trojan Energy devices are the only chargepoints that could help to cut road clutter.

Already in London there are hundreds of streetlights that have been converted to EV chargers as part of a scheme launched by Ubitricity.

Bulbs in the lampposts are switched to low-energy LED versions so that surplus electricity from the existing power supply can be used to charge EVs using a special charging cable from the brand.

Left: Ubitricity first installed lamppost chargers in London in June 2017. Right: A number of boroughs in the capital now have them because they mean there's no additional road furniture

EV owners can plug their vehicles into existing street furniture, meaning picturesque streets can remain almost unchanged

Another solution, launched in Oxford in 2019, is pop-up devices that retract into the ground.

The chargers, provided by Urban Electric, sink into the pavement and can be summoned out of the ground by plug-in vehicle owners when they need to use them.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It rarely pays to be loyal these days when it comes to the interest on your savings, but Coventry Building Society appears to be bucking that trend.

The UK's second largest building society has launched the Loyalty 21 Day Notice Saver paying 0.65 per cent.

And while that rate is hardly one to blow away savers, it does beat the lowly average-paying account and most rivals.

The account will only be open to customers who have been with Coventry since 1 January 2020 and comes with a few catches.

The new savings account will be available to members who have been with Coventry Building Society continuously starting on or before 1 January 2020.

The main limitation is that savers will only be able to save up to £20,000 in the account, or £40,000 for joint accounts and can access their savings as many times as they want with 21 days' notice, or immediately subject to 21 days' interest penalty.

James Blower, founder of The Savings Guru said: 'It is a really good offer from Coventry and it is great to see a provider rewarding loyalty rather than the best offers being for new customers only.

'However, Coventry look after £39.1 billion of deposits in a market of £1.7 trillion and, given the fact it is only for existing members and has a £20,000 per person limit, it's only going to be of interest to a few Coventry members and that's not significant enough to impact the wider savings market.'

How does it compare to other deals?

Someone stashing away the maximum £20,000 in Coventry's Loyalty 21 Day Notice Saver over the course of a year would earn £130 in interest.

That's much better than what a saver would earn in the average easy access account paying 0.18 per cent, according to Moneyfacts – just £36 interest from a £20,000 lump sum after one year.

Notice accounts, such as Coventry's, offer savers a higher return with the average notice account paying 0.45 per cent interest, according to Moneyfacts.

However, notice periods typically range between 30 and 90 days, meaning Coventry's 21-day notice period is less than usual.

The best paying account with a 30-day notice period is Secure Trust Bank paying 0.55 per cent, according to Moneyfacts.

However, Investec Bank is currently offering a rate of 0.7 per cent for a 32-day notice account.

Savers who apply for that via the savings platform, Raisin can also qualify for a welcome bonus payment of up to £50 depending on how much they put in.

In terms of the highest rates on offer, Hampshire Trust Bank is currently offering a rate of 0.85 per cent, but savers will need to give a much longer 95 days' notice to withdraw funds.

Although Coventry's rate is competitive it is by no means the best notice deal around: it's advantage, however, is that the notice period required to withdraw funds is only three weeks, which will give savers some peace of mind that their cash will be relatively accessible were they to suddenly need it.

Despite this, its notice period may still be an issue for those who prefer an immediate and penalty free access to their savings - particularly given that the best easy access rate now pays the same as Coventry's 'loyalty' account.

Tandem's easy-access account also pays 0.65 per cent and it provides instant access to savings, and allows unlimited deposits and withdrawals to a linked current account.

Other best buy options include Skipton's and Coventry's very own easy-access accounts but these also come with limitations.

Skipton pays 0.6 per cent, but limits savers to three withdrawals a year whilst Coventry, paying 0.55, allows six withdrawals per year after which savers forfeit 50 days interest.

In terms of other banks that reward loyalty, the list is hard to establish.

Cynergy Bank, for example, offer its existing savers, higher rates than it does to new customers.

'There are other banks who offer loyalty rates but many don't publish theirs - that doesn't mean they don't exist,' said Blower.

'Several of the new entrant banks, like PCF Bank for example, offer loyalty rates to savers at maturity which are better than those on sale to new customers.'

Loyalty aside, savers who are prepared to stash their cash away for a year or more without needing access, can achieve better returns by turning to a fixed rate deals, where there has been more competition and subsequently far better rates than instant-access.

The best one-year fixed rate account, offered by Zopa Bank, is currently paying interest of 1.12 per cent, while the best two-year deal by QIB (UK) is paying 1.37 per cent.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@To say it's not an easy time to be in aviation is an understatement. The pandemic has grounded thousands of planes and driven down the value of UK aerospace and defence companies, leaving them prey to foreign predators and private equity.

But two former Harrier jump jet pilots, Andy Offer, 55, and Chris Norton, 56, believe they can fly through the gloom that has engulfed the sector.

They set up their company, 2 Excel Aviation, after leaving the RAF.

On patrol: The bulk of 2Excel's work is for governments, the oil industry and the Ministry of Defence, including a contract to help the coastguard

Initially, they took customers on flights and put on displays at air shows as The Blades aerobatics team.

Having started out with five people and four aircraft, the company now has more than 400 staff and a fleet of 30 planes.

The business has branched out into repair and maintenance, testing for the Team Tempest fighter jet programme, surveillance services for the coastguard and dispersing oil spills.

Earlier this year, the 2 Excel Aviation completed a refinancing with Signal Capital Partners, and a stock market float is on the cards in the next two to four years.

Andy and Chris have already weathered one major patch of turbulence before the pandemic.

When the financial crisis struck in 2008, their original aerobatics business was badly hit.

'We knew we had to diversify from the Blades,' says Andy. 'But they were a good calling card.'

'At the time it was horrible but it was the best thing in hindsight.'

Andy, who joined the military straight from school and did several tours in Afghanistan, became the leader of the Red Arrows.

But despite an exciting life in the RAF, he was drawn to the world of business.

'I was always entrepreneurial. I loved the air force but found it frustrating.'

High flyers: 2Excel Aviation founders Andy Offer and Chris Norton believe they can fly through the gloom that has engulfed the sector since the pandemic began

He adds: 'Having said that, some of the military disciplines are superb. People are not late for work or late for meetings. They don't take sick days or days off.

'They work well as a team,' he adds. 'The Red Arrows is a high-performing team and what that means is harmony.'

From its main bases at Doncaster airport and Lasham Airfield in Hampshire, 2 Excel provides a range of aviation services.

Some of these, such as charter planes for VIPs including top football teams, have been hit in the pandemic, but much of its business has not been badly affected.

The bulk of its work is for governments, the oil industry and the Ministry of Defence, including a contract to help the coastguard.

Advanced sensors on 2 Excel's aircraft can spot a human being in the sea from more than 20 miles away, so those in distress can be located more easily. In one episode, a Spanish fishing boat had a badly injured crew member on board.

'He has to get to a hospital or he is going to die,' says Andy. 'But this is right on the limits of endurance for a search-and-rescue helicopter.

'So the helicopter can't faff around. The job of the our King Air plane was to find the fishing boat on its radar. They had a script in Spanish to talk to the trawler captain.

'By the time the helicopter came, the crew knew what to do.

'That meant the helicopter could be in and out as quickly as possible. They took the fisherman to hospital in Cornwall, and his life was saved.'

Another service is a 24/7 crisis spill response for the oil industry. 2 Excel has two Boeing 727s with a special oil dispersant system, operated out of Doncaster airport.

2 Excel is also designing a flight-test aircraft, based on a Boeing 757, for the Team Tempest fighter jet programme.

All the sensors and electronics will be tested on the aeroplane, the only flying test bed of its kind outside the US.

A sister operation, 2 Excel Engineering, which specialises in maintenance and repairs, is based in Lasham and is run by Chris.

Team work: Andy was leader of the Red Arrows, which are famous for their synchronised moves

He and Andy decided to buy the business out of administration in 2015, because it was providing the maintenance services for 2 Excel aircraft, and other options were thin on the ground.

'When it went bust, we thought 'Holy Cow, what do we do now?' says Chris.

'It went under overnight, and our aeroplane was in bits on the floor. So we decided to rebuild Lasham. We had to fix the reasons it went bust. Primarily it was lack of investment over a long period and it was losing customers.'

Chris set about investing in the site, putting down a new floor, revamping the derelict engineering workshop and creating a production line.

'More importantly, we had to solve cultural issues. When I put everything on a chart that we needed to fix, my production manager resigned,' he says.

'But we are very important to 2 Excel Aviation.

'We would never have won the contract for Team Tempest if we hadn't had this place.'

Trying to turn around the engineering business at Lasham has been bruising.

One of the problems, Chris admits, is that staff with years of experience were reluctant to change the way they worked. 'I had zero credibility with them because I was a pilot, not an engineer. You have to be quite thick-skinned,' he says.

Ahead of the pandemic, his division had over-expanded 'so we were in a cash hole when Covid hit', he explains.

'It was terrible, we were in a cash hurt locker.

'We are reconfiguring for the new realities. We have taken some hard choices and we have been able to balance the books.'

The engineering division is likely to be folded into the main business ahead of a float.

Andy and Chris want to fly the flag for British aviation at a time when a string of firms in the aerospace sector including Ultra Electronics, Meggitt, Cobham, Senior and Signature have been targeted by US private equity predators.

'For our industry, short-termism is not good,' says Andy.

'Our customers are long term and they don't want us to be owned by a US private equity house because it will change what we do.

'We nearly did a deal but we realised pretty quickly it would have been an asset strip.

'We are proud of the fact we are British, that our money is staying here and that we are delivering UK solutions.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The number of people buying homes through Help to Buy is at an all-time high, according to the latest Government figures - but rising house prices mean users could pay back thousands more than they borrowed.

The latest Help to Buy statistics show that in the financial year 2020-21, more than 55,600 households bought their home with the support of a Help to Buy equity loan.

This was an 8 per cent increase compared to the previous year, as first-time buyers joined in the home-purchasing boom.

On the ladder: First-time buyers used a record number of Help to Buy loans in 2020-21

The average price first-time buyers paid for their home was £290,000, above the national average of around £255,000, and their typical household income was just over £55,000.

A total of 328,506 households have now purchased a home using the scheme since it was introduced in 2013.

More than a half of those purchases were made with a deposit of 5 per cent of the property purchase price or less, and 23 per cent with a deposit ranging between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.

With the scheme set to end in 2023, buyers may be looking to get in under the wire - although the new First Homes scheme could also help them get on the ladder with Government support.

What is a Help to Buy: Equity Loan? First-time buyers can use the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme to purchase a new-build property up to the value of £600,000, with a maximum equity loan of £120,000 (20 per cent). In Greater London, the maximum equity loan is £240,000 (40 per cent). The Government lends borrowers a portion of the purchase price interest-free for five years, allowing them to boost their deposit and get a better mortgage rate. After five years, borrowers must either pay the Government back the current market value of their stake, or start paying interest. They can also repay early if they choose. The interest rate starts at 1.75 per cent in year six, and after that it rises in line with the Retail Price Index measure of inflation plus 1 per cent each year. So someone who bought a £200,000 home with a 20 per cent (£40,000) Help to Buy equity loan would pay £712 interest in year six, and in year 10 they would pay £896 - on top of mortgage payments. The scheme has run since 2013 and will continue until 2023. New restrictions were introduced this year which means it is now only open to first-time buyers, and there are regional limits meaning homes purchased must cost no more than 1.5 times the average first time buyer property price in that area.

Though the equity loan scheme has helped buyers get on the ladder at a time when house prices have risen by £23,000 in a year, past users of Help to Buy are being warned that those same house price increases could mean they end up paying back much more than they borrowed.

Property inflation has made life particularly difficult for first-time buyers, who need to save higher deposits without the benefit of increased equity in an existing property that home movers have.

The equity loan helps with that, but because of its structure, house price rises mean borrowers end up paying back more.

Instead of loans being a set amount borrowed, as a mortgage would be, Help to Buy loans are taken as a stake in the property - meaning that as a home rises in value, so too does the amount needing to eventually be repaid to the state.

Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: ‘Help to Buy equity loans provide an answer to the impossible question of how to buy in a rapidly rising property market.

'Most people who use them have a 5 per cent deposit, and the scheme stops them battling to raise a bigger percentage of the property price at a time when the average property rose more than £27,000 in a year.

‘However, while Help to Buy loans offer a solution to those struggling to buy in a rising market, the way they work means the same rising market will have a sting in the tail for anyone who takes advantage.

‘When the loan is eventually repaid to the Government, the amount that needs to be paid back depends on the value of the house at that time. If you borrow 20 per cent of the purchase price, you repay 20 per cent of the value after five years, so when prices rise, so do your repayments.’

According to Hargreaves Lansdown's analysis, if a buyer borrowed 20 per cent from the Government to buy the average property in May 2015, and then repaid the loan in May 2020, they would have to pay back £5,318 more than they borrowed.

The rising market in the past 12 months means that someone doing the same a year later would have had to repay £8,751 more than they borrowed - so the rising market would have cost them almost £3,500.

Buyers rushed to cash in Help to Buy Isas ahead of stamp duty deadline

The Government has also published figures on take-up of the Help to Buy Isa.

This is a scheme where the Government tops up deposit savings with a 25 per cent 'bonus,' up to a limit of £3,000, at the point that a borrower buys their home.

The data showed that 12,870 bonuses were paid in March 2021 - a 25 per cent increase on the previous month. This may reflect buyers racing to meet the stamp duty holiday deadline, which was initially set to be in March but was subsequently extended until June.

Use of Help to Buy Isa bonuses also spiked last year amid the house purchasing boom

The bonuses were used to buy 9,904 properties, compared to 7,297 in February.

The mean value of a property completion in the Help to Buy Isa scheme between December 2015 and March 2021 was £175,010, compared to the average first-time buyer price of £214,452 and the average UK house price of £256,405.

Although Help to Buy can be used on properties up to £450,000, only 29,000 or 5 per cent of the 539,000 homes bought under the scheme have been worth more than £250,000.

This reflects the fact that most completions in the scheme have been on properties outside London, in regions where house prices are typically lower.

Applications for new Help to Buy Isas closed in 2019, but existing borrowers can still save into the scheme and claim their bonuses until 2030.

New savers can also use a Lifetime Isa to get a Government bonus on their savings if they are using them to buy their first home.

Says Coles: ‘If you’re working hard to build a deposit, a Help to Buy equity loan isn’t your only option.

'If you’re aged 18-39, and you plan to buy your first property a year or more down the line, you could also consider saving at least some of the deposit in a Lifetime Isa.

'You can put £4,000 a year into a Lisa and the government will immediately top it up by 25 per cent - so you could get £1,000 a year from the Government to help you onto the property ladder. And through the Lisa, this never needs to be paid back.'

The billionaire offloaded 10.5million shares – about 4 per cent of the space-travel firm – leaving him with an 18 per cent stake.

The proceeds will support Branson's travel and leisure businesses, as well as help develop new ventures.

Light headed: Sir Richard Branson remains Virgin Galactic's biggest shareholder

Branson, 71, remains Virgin Galactic's biggest shareholder. The company's shares fell 1.5 per cent in New York in early trading. Last weekend Virgin Atlantic, the airline majority-owned by Branson's group, said it was considering a public offering in London as the company searches for more sources of funding.

The airline has been one of the hardest hit in the pandemic due to its reliance on flights to the US. Last year it put administrators on stand-by before the firm was rescued with a £1.2billion package, which required a £200million injection from Branson.

Virgin hopes it can persuade investors it will bounce back once transatlantic travel starts up again.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bonanza: At results time, some companies are also announcing significant one-off bonuses in the form of 'special dividends'

Following a famine during lockdown, dividend payments are beginning to roar back and create quite a tempting income feast.

And it's not just regular dividends, typically paid half-yearly or quarterly, that are creating the feeding frenzy.

At results time, some companies are also announcing significant one-off bonuses in the form of 'special dividends' after finding surplus cash on their balance sheet.

According to dividend monitoring expert Link Group, £1.4billion of special dividends were paid during the second quarter of this year by UK listed companies – far more than during the whole of 2020.

The momentum is such that Link Group forecasts that UK special dividends will total a staggering £12billion for 2021 as whole.

These dividends can be much higher than regular dividends, sometimes even amounting to 20per cent or more of a company's share price.

Why do companies pay special dividends?

Some of the biggest special dividend payouts occur when a company has raised a lot of cash by downsizing – or spinning off a subsidiary.

For example, in February Tesco paid a special dividend of 51 pence per share – then worth just over £3 each – following the sale of its Asian supermarkets.

And, last month, water company Pennon paid a special dividend of £3.55 per share – then worth about £17 each – after selling its waste management business.

But special dividends can simply be paid because a company has enjoyed a purple patch in terms of earnings.

Rather than using this money to make an acquisition, invest in research and development, or improve other aspects of its operations, it decides to give a slice to shareholders.

Paying a special dividend can prove a more attractive way of doing this than raising the regular dividend, which may not prove sustainable in the long run.

Although special dividends were traditionally viewed as a one-off payment, there is now a trend for some companies to use them more regularly.

For example, mining companies Ferrexpo and Rio Tinto have already declared two special dividends each this year as a result of booming commodity prices, having paid others in the past.

Will Walker-Arnott is senior investment manager at wealth manager Charles Stanley.

He says: 'There is a general trend in the commodity sector to move away from acquisitions and investing in production to returning money to investors.

'There was a period when it was felt shareholders were losing out as a result of companies being in the habit of making sometimes costly and expensive acquisitions. Now, they are being more disciplined with their balance sheets.'

Insurer Admiral, which paid a special dividend of 22.4 pence per share in June (then worth just over £31), and retailer Next – which will be paying £1.10 per share next month (its shares are currently worth just over £80) – operate in less volatile business sectors.

But they have found the payment of special dividends a good way of returning surplus cash to shareholders when trading has been strong. Guy Foster is chief strategist at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.

He says: 'The interesting thing about Admiral is that it has all the capital it needs to run its business. It doesn't need to reinvest money to increase its profits, so it pays a special dividend virtually every year.

'Next also has good capital allocation and has made regular use of special dividends.'

Use of both one-off and more regular special dividends should accelerate as a growing number of companies realise they have accumulated spare cash as a result of faring better than expected during the pandemic.

In particular, management could be worried that having a surplus of cash on their balance sheets might make them vulnerable to being bought by a private equity predator looking for value not reflected in the company's share price.

There can be drawbacks

Special dividends are not without potential drawbacks. Those wishing to reinvest them to buy more shares may have to pay brokerage fees, while a strong pound can reduce the value of payments made by multinationals in different currencies.

Indeed, Link Group reports that in the second quarter of this year UK special dividends as a whole were reduced by about 10 per cent because 80 per cent of them were declared in US dollars.

More importantly, as with regular dividends, the share price of companies paying special dividends usually falls on the 'ex-dividend date' – the point at which you need to own shares to qualify for the dividend payment.

As a broad rule of thumb, it falls by the amount of the special dividend being paid out, reflecting the resultant decrease in the value of the company. So, what you gain on the roundabouts you lose on the swings.

But sometimes the share price falls by less than the dividend amount – known as 'going ex-dividend well'. On other occasions it falls by more than the dividend amount – known as 'going ex-dividend badly'.

Brewin Dolphin's Foster says: 'If it goes ex-dividend badly, it is typically the case that investors don't think the company can afford to pay that dividend. But, if it goes ex-dividend well, it's because people want to hold shares in the company.

'The most important factor is that the company's management is effecting good capital allocation, making the right decisions about whether they should be investing in building a new factory or returning money to shareholders.'

He adds: 'If, for example, a growth company making regular healthy profits suddenly pays out a special dividend, then investors might have made higher returns if the company had simply reinvested all of the profits in the business.'

Some critics of special dividends even argue that their payment can be a sign that a company has struggled to identify new investment or acquisition opportunities.

How to profit from special dividends

Even though share prices normally fall on the ex-dividend date, they tend to increase when details of the special dividend is announced.

So astute investors can potentially make money by identifying those companies likely to make such announcements.

Are there, for example, certain sectors looking particularly buoyant or individual businesses looking likely to sell off significant assets? Even if the management opts instead for share buybacks (see panel, below left), you should still benefit from an increased share price.

It's a bit like identifying companies that will be takeover targets. Both are speculative strategies and there is no guarantee that either the takeover or special dividend will happen.

But if you restrict speculation to companies with strong financial fundamentals and regard any special dividends that arise as the icing on the cake, you shouldn't go far wrong.

Justin Urquhart Stewart is cofounder of investment platform Regionally.

He says: 'Even if you don't feel confident identifying individual companies, you could look at a sector with a lot of issues in common.

'I wouldn't be surprised if most major British banks start paying special dividends by the end of the year.

'I believe the drinks sector could also present special dividend opportunities, as could the consumer products sector, where companies such as Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser have strong international brands, the value of which aren't properly reflected in their share prices.'

However, some experts stress that they do not regard trying to sniff out stocks that might pay a special dividend as a sound strategy. Some also regard basing a portfolio simply around a search for high yields and headline income as unwise.

Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'Investors need to balance dividend returns with prospects for growth in the value of their shares.

'Companies should also be sought out that reinvest profits into the business to maintain growth.'

Rather than trying to narrow down the number of stocks held, she says: 'A growing portfolio is important, as over time this also means the income it produces will rise, which helps to offset the effects of inflation.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Defiant: Ian Barratt received a warning letter stamped 'enforcement officer visit approved'

Demands from 'BBC bullies' ordering pensioners to pay for their TV licences have led to hundreds of readers proclaiming that they will never surrender and pay up.

The Mail on Sunday has been overwhelmed with emails and letters from over-75s who refuse to pay the new £159 annual levy – even if it means being sent to prison.

An army of TV Licensing enforcers will knock on the doors of more than a quarter of a million pensioners who have yet to purchase a licence from next month.

This follows letters demanding they pay up. Some are already being threatened with visits.

Last week, The Mail on Sunday reported how – masquerading as 'customer care' visitors – these doorstep enforcers will confirm that people have a TV and then order them to pay up.

This attack on the purse strings of the elderly and most vulnerable follows the scrapping of the free TV licence for over-75s by the BBC last August, although it gave them a year's grace in the form of a 'transition period', which ended two weeks ago.

While most of the four million pensioners targeted have already paid up, a hard core of 260,000 are standing firm – refusing to be bullied into paying.

Failure to pay for a TV licence – required by law to watch live television on any channel – can lead to prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000. If payment is not forthcoming, the courts can imprison offenders.

Many pensioners are furious that the BBC has broken its previous promise to always provide a free TV licence for the elderly – most of whom earned this reward after a lifetime of payments.

Others, including 60,000 surviving on less than £180 a week, argue that they were not warned to budget for the extra fee and are already struggling under the weight of soaring energy and council tax bills.

There is also widespread anger at the huge 'waste' in the BBC – frittering licence fees on salaries of over £150,000 a year on at least 150 'senior leaders' and presenters.

The BBC has also been widely criticised for its politically correct agenda. Examples include paying 'creative diversity director' June Sarpong £267,000 a year for a three-day week – on top of private earnings from corporate events, for which she charges £5,000 to £6,000.

Ian Barratt, from Maldon in Essex, is among those TV Licensing has targeted. The married 78- year-old found an 'enforcement visit approved' letter thrust through his letterbox a few days ago – with threats that an 'enforcement officer' could visit imminently.

The letter says: 'Our officers visit an address every six seconds. Day. Evening. Even weekends. And if no one answers, they can come back.'

Ian, who is receiving treatment for cancer, says: 'We must stand up to the BBC bullies. I am so incensed by its arrogant attitude towards pensioners. I am one of the lucky ones because I can pay.

'But I am not going to surrender without putting up an almighty fight. No one bothered to consult people like me. They can throw me in jail if they wish.'

The retired journalist, married to Iris, 77, is restricting his viewing so he does not have to buy a licence.

This involves never watching any live TV, but sticking to catch-up or on-demand services such as ITV Hub, All4, My5, Now TV, Apple TV, Netflix and Amazon, as well as DVDs.

Licensing rules mean he cannot watch BBC iPlayer. He says 'Not watching live TV or using BBC iPlayer means I am exempt from paying the licence fee, though that does not seem to cut the mustard with enforcers who continue to hound elderly people like me.'

TV Licensing – the payment collection arm of the BBC – is keen to distance itself from terms such as enforcers and debt collectors by slapping a 'customer care' label on the process, claiming staff are 'specially trained in assisting older customers' and that there is no 'record of interview'.

This means that visits are not recorded, so cannot be used as evidence in court when chasing fees.

Yet it contradicts itself by using the term 'enforcement visit' in the letters it sent to some pensioners.

Roy Hubbarde, from Anstey in Leicestershire, is unimpressed by the way the Corporation is trying to hide the true purpose of the home visits.

He says: 'Why are they describing someone knocking on my door demanding my cash as a 'customer care visit'?

'There is something rather sinister and Orwellian about this BBC approach.'

The married 76-year-old also questions the amount of money being spent in chasing pensioners for money.

According to Citizens Advice, the cost of a bailiff visit – called enforcement – is £235. So the cost of a TV Licensing enforcer's visit could be more than the £159 debt being chased.

BBC CAN THROW ME IN JAIL - I WON'T GIVE THEM A PENNY 'I have tried all my life to be an upstanding citizen, obeying rules. But the BBC enforcers can throw me in jail. My money was too hardearned to give the broadcaster one penny to waste. Let's hope enough of us have the guts and backbone to fight this shameful outfit.' Ann James, 82, Cornwall 'The BBC continues to increase the six and seven figure salaries of already overpaid 'talent' – making paying this the responsibility of pensioners. We do not deserve to have enforcers on our doorsteps threatening us. If they come, we'll politely say: 'No, thank you.' Marion Bailey, 81, West Somerset 'The BBC has gone back on a promise. The problem is the broadcaster likes to spend the £3.5billion it gets from licence fees each year like water. Rather than wasting cash on non-jobs and gameshow prizes, it should budget more carefully.' Christopher Roberts, 80, Northampton 'The BBC has lost its independence and become a spokesman for 'woke'. We want unbiased reporting and this is not what we get. So it can fine me £1,000 or throw me in jail – with three square meals a day and free TV.' Alan Corbett, 80, Derby 'I have informed the BBC that I will not be paying for the rubbish it spews out or for the ridiculous salaries paid to morons. So far no one has even bothered to reply. Bring it on. If enough stand up to this bully it will be interesting.' Mike Hills, 77, St Neots, Cambridgeshire 'My plan is to invite any 'customer care' enforcer who knocks on the door to come in for a chat. I will offer them a cup of tea – my own caring side – and tell them I intend to record our conversation. I wonder what they will say?' Chris Dobbins, 79, Norwich

Roy says: 'BBC founder Lord Reith said its aim was to inform, entertain and educate. But since those fine words, the BBC has totally lost the plot. I refuse to pay for its 'woke' agenda and, if needs be, I look forward to watching TV for free in prison.'

Jan Shortt, general secretary of the campaign group National Pensioners Convention, is particularly fearful for the many thousands of retired people who are struggling to survive on incomes of about £180 a week – for whom this extra bill brings not just additional financial hardship, but tough decisions on how to spend their limited income.

She says: 'For many elderly people who live on their own, the TV provides companionship – and can be a godsend. Sadly, far too many cannot afford the licence fee.'

Shortt points out that an estimated 1.5million households are eligible for a free licence because they receive Pension Credit – but only about 800,000 have so far applied.

The benefit can be claimed if the income of a single pensioner is less than £177.10 a week, or £270.30 for a couple. If Pension Credit is used to top up income to this level, it enables pensioners to be eligible for a free TV licence.

The BBC told The Mail on Sunday: 'Now the transition period is over, our focus is to continue to support everyone to become correctly licensed.

'We appreciate there is a small group that have not yet made arrangements, which is why we have written to them setting out simple steps to take to get set up. It includes a range of payment options to spread the cost.'

It added: 'Customer care visits are planned to begin in the autumn, aimed solely to assist people to become correctly licensed. These will be carried out by members of staff specially trained in assisting older customers.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I am a 64-year-old woman, and when I was younger I took some time off from work to raise my family.

I am now wondering how the time I spent at home will affect my retirement income.

Will the period in which I was looking after my child be counted towards the 35 years of National Insurance contributions I need to get my full state pension? And how does the credits system work?

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Retirement finances: How will my time as a stay-at-home Mum affect my pension?

Steve Webb replies: The way in which your state pension is protected for time at home with children changed in 2010.

I will start by covering your situation as someone yet to retire, but I will also explain the old rules for those who may have been retired for some years, in case they may be missing out, as I am sure some pensioners are.

When protection for time at home with children was first introduced in 1978, it went by the rather old-fashioned name of 'Home Responsibilities Protection' or HRP.

Since 2010, years spent at home have simply been referred to as years of National Insurance credits. HRP years already earned were converted into years of credits for those who were yet to retire.

You now get a year of credits for any complete financial year in which you were getting child benefit for a child aged under 12 (since 2010/11) or under 16 (from 1978/79 to 2009/10). Note that the year in which your child turns 12 or 16 does not count.

Importantly, the child benefit has to be in your name. If the child benefit was in your partner's name, you can apply to get the credits/HRP transferred. However, this only applies to those reaching pension age since 2008.

Since 6 April 2016, you have needed 35 years of full rate NI contributions to get a full new state pension, whilst from 2010/11 to 2015/16 the target was 30 years for a full basic pension under the old system.

A year at home with a young child earns you just as much state pension as a year in a well-paid job

Under the new state pension, a year of NI credits for time at home with a child counts as one full year towards your 35 year target.

A year at home with a young child therefore earns you just as much state pension as a year in a well-paid job.

If you have several children, you can continue to get credits as long as the youngest child is under 12.

Although I have talked about being 'at home' with the children, there is no specific rule about what you are doing during the year in question.

Obviously, if you are working and paying NI contributions then the NI credit is of no value - though it could be transferred to a grandparent in certain cases. But if you are not working or don't earn enough to pay or be credited with NI, then the credit for being a parent is very valuable.

Better-off families could be missing out

One worry at the moment is that growing numbers of better off families may be missing out on these vital credits. Because of the 'high income child benefit charge', some new families have decided simply not to bother claiming child benefit.

But if they don't claim at all, they don't get the NI credits towards their pension. If they don't want the hassle of getting child benefit and then paying a tax bill, they should simply register for 'credits only'.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

It is important to get on with doing this as new claims can only be backdated for three months.

Turning now to people who reached pension age before April 2010, the system worked in a rather different way.

Until 2010, women generally needed 39 years of NI contributions to get a full basic pension. Any years of HRP (for children under 16) were knocked off the 39-year target.

To see how this worked, consider the case of a woman who had 9 years of HRP and 15 years of NI contributions through work.

In this case, the woman's target for a full pension would be reduced from 39 years to 30 years because of the 9 years of HRP.

Her 15 years of contributions would then entitle her to a 50 per cent pension, based on 15/30th of the full rate.

An important point to note is that women who had opted to pay the reduced 'married woman's stamp' did not qualify for HRP for those years.

To be more precise, HRP was not awarded for any year in which such a woman either was paying the reduced stamp or would have been eligible to do so if she had been in work.

In theory, getting NI credits or HRP onto your National Insurance record should be automatic. Your record on the Child Benefit computer is matched to your National Insurance record and credits should appear automatically.

But I have heard from lots of people over the years where this did not happen. If uncorrected, this can mean you don't get all the state pension to which you should be entitled.

Anyone who has missed out on HRP can claim it using Form CF411, and anyone who has missed out on NI credits can claim it using Form CF411a.

If you think this might be you, I would be interested to hear from you, especially if you have full details of why you think you may have missed out.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The founder of Pret a Manger has warned that restaurant prices are set to rise by more than a fifth because of the soaring cost of staff.

Julian Metcalfe, 61, said the pandemic had brought a 'perfect storm' which made 'massive' wage increases to up to £15 per hour inevitable.

The entrepreneur, who is now chief executive of Itsu, said his shipping costs were four times higher than pre-pandemic.

'Perfect storm': Pubs and restaurants have struggled for staff, leading some to increase wages

Pubs and restaurants have struggled for staff, leading some to increase wages, while a shortage of lorry drivers has also led wages to rise.

In addition, industry leaders have reported a rise in the price of meat and fresh produce of up to a seventh, while beer prices around London have rocketed.

Firms have cut their menus to reduce costs in the kitchen, while others have increased the price of side dishes or alcohol. Seaside towns are facing the toughest price pressures as record demand from staycationers meets a shortage of hospitality workers.

Metcalfe said he expected to push wages for staff up by as much as £5 per hour, equivalent to £9,100 per year, as he opens 24 new restaurants.

He said: 'The cost of labour and ingredients is sky-rocketing. Soon prices in restaurants are going to go up... it could be 20, 30, or 40 per cent.

'Yes of course we're going to have to put up wages massively. It's a perfect storm.

'A McDonald's for two in Zurich is 26 euros (£22), and they still have access to the EU labour pool in Switzerland – we don't. There's no law that says that McDonald's has to sell a cheeseburger for 99p any more, it could be £1.99.'

James Almond, whose family runs four pubs in the North-West, said the recruitment crisis is forcing wages up. He said: 'It's going to cost me more to pour a pint or put a meal on a plate. I would happily charge £8 for your pint of beer if customers would pay.'

The price of some of his wines has gone up by one tenth.

Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: 'There's significant food price and wage inflation.'

Clive Black, of Shore Capital, said: 'Restaurants and hotels have to rebuild their balance sheets and generate cash and make up for the massive loss of earnings over 18 months.'

But prices may be held in check if customers vote with their feet. One analyst said: 'Twenty to 40 per cent is cloud-cuckoo-land. Restaurants are already struggling to compete with ready meals and home cooking.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I have a small pension pot of around £12,500 which matures later this year.

I need some guidance on whether to take it as one lump sum, part lump sum and annuity or simply leave it in for further growth.

How big is the risk to keep the fund invested for some time? I would like to thank you in advance for your expert help.

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Retirement finances: Should I cash in a £12,500 pension pot, buy an annuity or keep it invested?

Steve Webb replies: The advent of 'automatic enrolment' into a workplace pension has helped millions of people to make a start on retirement saving and to build up a pension pot.

But all of these people will at some point need to make choices about what to do with it.

And, because your pension pot is relatively modest, the chances are that it would simply not be cost-effective to pay for financial advice. So where can you go for help and what are your options?

For anyone aged 50 or above the first port of call is Pension Wise. This is a free service organised by the Government and hosted by an organisation now called MoneyHelper.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

You can find information on their website here or you can book a phone consultation.

Whilst they won't give financial advice they will guide you through your options and explain in general terms the implications of each.

Without knowing your full financial circumstances, including things like your other sources of income in retirement, how much risk you are comfortable taking, your wider household situation, your health and so on, it is hard to say that there is an obvious 'right answer' as to what you should do.

But I can offer a few pointers for things you should think about.

The first obvious point to make is that there is no great significance in the December 2021 'maturity' date of your pension.

I imagine this is simply the date that you have told your pension company you might want to take your pension or is a key birthday.

Either way, there is absolutely no need to access your pension at this point. Just because you 'can' take your pension, it doesn't mean that you 'should'.

Indeed, unless you particularly need the money, there is a lot to be said for continuing to invest it, either within the current pension or in some other investment.

One option you mention is buying an 'annuity' or income for life. If you do go down this route, you should definitely shop around for the best rate.

Your own pension provider (whose name you have given me) do not offer annuities themselves, but they may well help you to find someone who does.

When you apply for an annuity it is very important to supply full details of any health problems or if you are a smoker, as this can result in you getting a better rate.

Having said that, although £12,000 feels like a lot of money, it is very much at the small end when it comes to buying an annuity.

You may find that not many companies will offer you an annuity at all, or that the rates are not great.

One thing that you could explore is combining this pension with any other pension pots you have in order to get a better rate, if an annuity is the right answer for you.

One problem with buying an annuity, especially if you are still of working age, is that it adds to your taxable income.

If you draw it now, rather than waiting until you are retired and have a lower income, you may end up paying more tax on it than you need to.

Another very important factor to consider, whether you take your pension as income or as a lump sum, is the potential impact on any benefits you are receiving.

In particular, some benefits, such as Universal Credit, have strict 'capital limits' and if you go above these you may lose all your benefit.

Although the UC capital limit is £16,000 and your pension pot is only just over £12,000, if you already had a few thousand pounds in the bank you could end up over the limit.

If you are getting help with your council tax from an English local authority, the capital limit could be as low as £6,000, so taking all of your pension could wipe out that help.

I would strongly recommend that you visit your pension provider's website or contact them to find out what happens if you leave your pot with them as it stands.

It is very unlikely to be 'frozen', but the way it is invested could change.

Like millions of other people, you are a member of something called a Master Trust, which is a big, multi-employer pension scheme which is widely used for automatic enrolment and was mainly designed to help people build up pension pots.

Historically these schemes have been less focused on the post-retirement phase, so they often have fairly basic offerings which tend to be fairly cautiously invested.

The key is to find out what will happen to your money if you leave it where it is and compare it with other options.

Sienna looked very fashionable as she opted for Margiela Tabi cream Mary Jane shoes, and she accessorised simply with a long beaded necklace.

Completing the paired back ensemble, Sienna swept her bright blonde locks from her face in a low bun, and protected herself as she wore a blue disposable mask.

Making sure she was prepared for any weather, she slung a grey coat over arm while holding her phone in her hand.

Sienna revealed earlier this year she wouldn't stand in the way of her daughter Marlowe's ambitions, should she wish to follow in her footsteps and become an actress.

She made made her big screen debut in South Kensington aged 19, insists the #MeToo movement has helped make the entertainment industry better for women, after a spotlight was shone on sexual harassment and inequity.

She told The Sunday Times' Culture supplement: 'I love being an actor. It is a great job and my daughter is artistic. I would never dissuade her [and] predatory behaviour is in any workplace or bar.

'It’s something women have to navigate that men probably underestimate. And have to deal with their entire lives. I’m glad she’s growing up in a world where that behaviour is not tolerated in the way it was when I was young.

While she has admitted to getting 'shouted at' by disgraced film producer Harvey Weintstein, New York-born Sienna believes that increased awareness of the industry's issues behind the scenes has made things better all around.

She explained: '[T]here comes a feeling of solidarity in being able to stand up for yourself and not be accused of whinging. I will not now tolerate certain behaviour that I probably would have acquiesced to because it was easier in the past.'

American Women star Sienna shares Marlowe with former partner Tom Sturridge, from whom she split in 2015, following a four-year romance.

She was famously in an on-off relationship with Jude Law, 48, which began in 2003 and, following a long break, came to its ultimate end at the start of 2011.

The pair became engaged on Christmas Day 2004, less than seven months before Alfie star Jude would issue a public apology for cheating with the children's nanny.

The NCIS star, who plays special agent Leroy Gibbs on the hit CBS show, was pictured at a garage in the San Fernando Valley last week after being dropped off by his wife of 34 years, Mork & Mindy actress Pam Dawber, 69.

While the actor, who is reported to make a whopping $525,000 per episode, could certainly afford a snazzy set of wheels, he appears to have a more low-key style, preferring the classics.

The 69-year-old, who turns 70 on September 2, was seen inspecting a white, vintage Ford F-250 pickup truck before getting in and speeding off.

He added to his down-to-earth charm as he arrived in a baggy checkered shirt, khaki style pants, and sneakers.

The outing comes as Harmon is set to reprise his role in the long-running police procedural series in its upcoming 19th season premiering in September.

The action drama has been ranked as TV's most watched series and attracts an average of 12 million viewers per episode.

But plans to renew NCIS had been up in the air for months following reports in February that Harmon intended to leave his role.

After playing the lead character for 18 years, the actor was reportedly planning to retire from the show.

CBS told Harmon and the executive producer they would likely cancel the series if he left, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investors wondering whether to put some of their hard-earned cash into the Chinese stock market are faced with a paradox: the country is too big and influential to ignore, but the market is too unpredictable for anything other than a bumpy ride.

The past few days have illustrated the difficulties of investing in a country run by a political elite that tolerates a 'form of phoney capitalism'.

An expected crackdown on online gaming, especially among the young Chinese, sent shares in Tencent – China's largest video games operator – into a tailspin.

This followed in the wake of other crackdowns on China's technology sector. Last month, the Chinese government announced it would be barring tutoring for profit in core school subjects to ease financial pressures on families that have contributed to low birth rates.

Too hot to handle?: It is difficult to invest in a country run by a political elite that tolerates a 'form of phoney capitalism'

The news sent shockwaves through China's vast private education sector, hitting providers' share prices.

The government also ordered app stores to remove Didi Chuxing's app, claiming the ride-hailing company had been illegally collecting users' personal data.

This is after Didi, founded in China in 2012, had just listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The intervention sent Didi's shares plunging.

'Scratch beneath the thin veneer and China is an illiberal, Marxist state where the priorities of the Communist Party will always ultimately take precedence and where political influence weighs heavily on companies,' says Jason Hollands, a director of wealth manager Tilney Smith & Williamson.

'This makes the case for investing in China tricky on so many levels – morally as well as on investment grounds.'

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index has now lost more than 45 per cent of its value since February.

So, does this represent a buying opportunity or, as Hollands suggests, should Chinese investments now be treated with extreme caution?

Too big to ignore... the case for investing in China

'If you haven't got any Chinese exposure in your investment portfolio, you probably need some,' says James Carthew, fund analyst at research company Quoted Data.

Carthew believes there are bargains to pick up after the sharp market falls of recent weeks and months. 'China is too big to ignore,' he adds. 'Its economy continues to grow and its consumers are becoming more affluent.'

Big name companies in China are increasingly household brands across the world.

A record 143 of Fortune's top 500 global companies this year were Chinese, including the likes of online retailer JD.com, technology giant Alibaba, Tencent and electronics company Xiaomi.

Given strong domestic consumption, Carthew believes all these companies have the ability to keep on growing and generating cash – despite the intimidatory actions of China's President Xi Jinping.

Pruksa Iamthongthong is investment director of Asia Dragon, an investment trust run by funds giant Abrdn (previously known as Aberdeen Standard Investments). She is comfortable with the 39 per cent exposure that the £630million fund has in China.

Among its top ten holdings are Alibaba, Tencent and drinks manufacturer Kweichow Moutai.

She says: 'Despite the unsettling events of the past few weeks, we believe the private sector retains a critical role in ensuring that the Chinese economy continues to innovate and prosper – and that China reaches its goal of being a moderately prosperous nation by 2035.'

She believes that despite the government's interference in certain business sectors, the Communist Party does not intend to make the stock market too risky for investors to have confidence in.

She adds: 'A broad, heavy-handed clampdown on private new economy sectors seems unlikely given their importance in underpinning China's economic vision for a modern productive, consumption-led economy.

'As a result, we remain positive about the long-term prospects for Chinese equities.'

143 of Fortune's top 500 global companies this year were Chinese, including retailer JD.com

Experts fear meddling from government

Darius McDermott, managing director at fund scrutineer Chelsea Financial Services, says that the Chinese government's clampdown on key business sectors represents a warning to investors about the risks of investing in Chinese equities.

He says: 'Does the Chinese government want to totally destroy the idea of stock market investing while still having foreign investors investing in their country?

'The answer is probably no, but recent unfriendly regulatory moves clearly represent a power play from them. Investors should take note that further intervention is possible, impacting adversely on some of China's leading listed companies.'

Ben Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial Planning, adds that investors should not be surprised when the Chinese government gets heavy handed.

He says: 'China has always been an interventionist economy, so the fact the government has intervened in recent days and months should be no surprise. It is one of the clear risks of investing in Chinese equities.'

Hollands says: 'Under Xi Jinping, China has moved in an increasingly hardline direction, and recent interventions signal the Communist regime's desire to stamp its authority on the private sector. Investors should take heed.'

KEEP INVESTMENTS MODEST, SAY EXPERTS Most investment experts believe it would be foolish to ignore the Chinese market altogether. 'The long-term case for investing in China's growth story remains intact,' says Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at wealth manager Interactive Investor. 'Growth of the middle classes and the recent refocusing of China's economy towards domestic consumption rather than exports are expected to be key drivers of future economic growth and the stock market in the coming years.' However, it is important to be wary, investing only a proportion of your portfolio in Chinese stocks and picking the right sectors and companies. 'It pays to be selective,' says Abrdn's Pruksa Iamthongthong, adding that investors have 'indiscriminately sold off the broader market', meaning there are opportunities to be had. Jason Hollands agrees that Chinese equity prices now look compelling. He says: 'Sentiment towards China has been severely impacted in recent weeks and this has depressed company valuations, particularly in sectors like technology. 'This clearly creates some buying opportunities for long-term investors. But it is important to be prepared for bumps in the road.' He says that regulatory interventions should be seen as an 'inherent risk' and that investors should take an approach that is 'both selective, but sufficiently diversified'. China should only be a 'modest component of an overall wealth portfolio,' adds Holland.

Spread the risk with a diversified fund

Investing in Chinese shares is difficult. Due to the rules governing foreign ownership of shares, foreign investors have to buy through 'variable interest entities'.

And as Chelsea's McDermott warns, there would be nothing to stop the Chinese government at some stage deciding these structures are worthless.

This is the risk you have to take with China, even if you invest in investment funds. But at least a diversified fund spreads risk.

Some experts suggest that investors should avoid China-only funds and instead opt for a trust or fund that invests throughout Asia. Tilney's top Asian fund selections include Fidelity Emerging Markets and FSSA Asia Focus.

Meanwhile, Chelsea has identified a number of 'elite' Asian funds. These include Fidelity Asian Dividend, Invesco Asian, JPM Asia Growth, Pacific Tiger (managed by Asian specialist Matthews Asia) and investment trust Schroder Oriental Income.

Interactive Investor's Dzmitry Lipski likes Fidelity Asia, Guinness Asian Equity Income and investment trust JPMorgan Emerging Markets.

An alternative approach is to buy a global investment fund that has limited exposure to China. For example, Scottish Mortgage, the country's largest investment trust, has a fifth of its investments in Chinese equities – the likes of Tencent and Alibaba.

But its global investment remit means it has not been hit as hard performance wise as some Asian or China-only funds. Over the past year, it has still managed to achieve a total return for shareholders in excess of 50 per cent.

For those who prefer a pure China fund, Lipski suggests Fidelity China Special Situations. The trust, which has generated a return of 64 per cent over the past three years, has been managed by Dale Nicholls since April 2014.

Lipski adds: 'Due to the single country focus and its bias towards small and mid-sized Chinese companies, its investment return profile is volatile, making it high-risk, and should represent no more than a satellite holding in a well-diversified portfolio.'

Chelsea's McDermott suggests FSSA Greater China Growth, managed by Martin Lau, which he says 'has proven its ability to perform in any market environment'.

The fund has made losses of five per cent over the past six months, but it has delivered respectable gains of 52 per cent over the past three years.

He also likes trusts Fidelity China Special Situations and JPMorgan China Growth & Income which has taken a 27 per cent hit over the past six months – but is up 129 per cent over three years.

Investors should expect this level of price volatility to continue as China's economic transformation marches on – despite a government intent on dictating what its biggest companies can and cannot do.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Flood warnings are a homeowner’s worst nightmare. And if this week’s doomsday report on climate change is anything to go by, extreme flooding is set to become increasingly common.

It means it has never been more important to have first-rate home insurance that will pay out should the worst happen.

For years, households living in flood-risk areas were routinely refused affordable cover.

Warning: If this week’s doomsday report on climate change is anything to go by, extreme flooding is set to become increasingly common

But the launch of the Government’s Flood Re scheme in 2016 has helped hundreds of thousands of homeowners to save hundreds of pounds in premiums.

Yet, as Laura Shannon reports, sneaky small print means that you can still be landed with a hefty bill — even if you don’t live near any river, lakes or the sea.

This is because some insurers charge a separate flooding excess — which is the amount you have to pay before your provider will step in to cover the claim. And in Laura’s case, this was an eye-watering £2,500.

Despite working as a personal finance journalist for more than a decade, I’ll hold my hands up and say I have never heard of a flood excess. And, like Laura, I certainly wouldn’t have thought to check if I wasn’t living in a known flood zone.

Even more baffling was her insurer’s definition of what counts as an ‘outbuilding’.

After conducting my own research (by asking five friends), I can say with authority that no one would ever think that driveways, fences and patios count as an outbuilding when working out how much cover they need.

Laura’s story should come as a stark warning to anyone opting for the cheapest policy they can find on a comparison site.

All-too-often, the scramble to top the best-buy tables sees providers scale back cover or introduce costly exclusions.

Meanwhile, a tick-box approach to buying policies online means it is all too easy to make a mistake on the application form. And as we see time and again at Money Mail, even the smallest error can have devastating consequences and see any future claims thrown out.

In light of Laura’s experience, you can be sure I’ve now dug out my own home insurance policy and scoured the small print with an even keener eye.

I’d highly recommend that you do the same.

Roaming moan

Well, that didn’t take long. After promising not to bring back costly roaming fees for holidaymakers using their mobile phones in Europe, two big UK providers have reneged on their pledge.

For years, these rip-off charges were a massive moneyspinner for greedy phone companies.

So when a clampdown was finally announced in 2017, we cheered.

Even after Brexit, firms were quick to reassure loyal customers they had no plans to reintroduce the fees.

But we should have known their weasel words were not to be trusted. And I’d bet my hat that other providers follow EE and Vodafone’s lead before long.

Given telecoms firms have already slapped customers with price hikes of up to 4.5 pc this year, you would have hoped they’d show greater restraint.

Instead, it looks like it’s back to the old days of having to turn off roaming when you get on a plane to avoid being stung.

Just the trick

In February, I shared how I got a half-price Now TV deal by threatening to cancel my subscription.

But, after six months, the price is back at £9.99, which felt pricey when I also pay for a TV licence, Amazon Prime and Netflix.

Wondering if the same trick might work twice, I logged into my account and clicked ‘cancel’.

Twice the firm tried to lure me back by boasting of the hundreds of boxsets I’d have at my fingertips, before bingo: ‘How about a special offer just for you?’ This time it’s an even better deal at £3.99 a month.

If I wasn’t so thrilled by the saving I’d feel almost guilty. I had no intention of cancelling my subscription — at least not until I have finished watching all eight seasons of Game Of Thrones (I know I’m a few years behind, but I’m hooked!)

That is the warning of Tom Becket, chief investment officer at Psigma Investment Management, who says investors should beware the overcrowded strategy of holding low yielding government bonds and high growth US shares.

The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates and the European Central Bank has followed and restarted quantitative easing, meanwhile expectations in the UK are now for the base rate to fall rather than rise.

Yet the new world of falling rates will not be the same as the post-financial crisis one, where a wave of cheap money provided a rising tide that lifted all boats, argues Becket.

Instead, he says that investors may consider looking to the world’s unloved assets, including Japanese shares, certain emerging markets, Europe’s better companies and UK companies beaten up by the Brexit storms.

He joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter on the latest Investing Show to explain why he thinks the mood music has changed for the cheerleaders of globalisation and how investors can prepare themselves to protect their wealth and profit in the years ahead.

On this Investing Show, published on 5 October 2019, Jon Forster, of Impax Environmental Markets, joins us to explain what this interesting investment trust does and what he has learnt in almost two decades of investing this way, through both boom and bust.

The trust focusses on energy, water, waste and sustainable food and within those categories are some companies doing fascinating things. Watch the video to find out more.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Happy new year, happy new lockdown.

2021 has seen off 2020, but schools and large chunks of the economy have shut down again and people have been ordered to stay at home, as across the UK the nations adopt their own version of lockdown.

It’s probably been the gloomiest start to a year for as long as many can remember and a tough winter for people, businesses and the economy lies ahead.

So what happened? The UK stock market jumped, of course.

Contrary as this may seem, there is some logic to investors buying into the hope that better times lie ahead.

We have Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out that will hopefully make this national lockdown the last people have to endure – and we also have a Brexit deal.

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Lee Boyce and Simon Lambert look at what the fresh lockdown means for the economy and why investors are choosing to look straight through it and develop a new appetite for buying British.

Are UK shares undervalued and a great opportunity for 2021 and beyond – and will a strong consumer rebound once the economy is reopened prove the catalyst the FTSE needs?

The team also discuss the potential implications of the Brexit deal for people’s finances and businesses.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100’s gains may have been substantial for a week on the stock market, but they are nothing compared to bitcoin’s continuing rise. The cryptocurrency cracked $40,000 this week: what’s going on, are people making real money out of this, and is there any idea what could happen next?

Also, on this week’s podcast, the team talk moving home and getting your property looking attractive for a sale and with everyone stuck at home again, how to improve your wifi.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Has the V-shaped recovery been put on hold?

Lockdowns across Britain’s major cities, the tier system and more businesses being forced to close their doors or operate far below usual business levels means the direction of travel has shifted dramatically from the summer’s optimistic reopening of the economy.

It's likely that the UK will emerge from recession with growth over this quarter, but is it on track to head straight back into another slump?

Coronavirus measures, rules that hobble some sectors and a renewed sense of fear will slam the brakes on – and the effect was great enough to make Rishi Sunak upgrade his support for jobs and businesses again this week.

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost and Simon Lambert look at how bad this winter will be and whether Britain can battle its way out of the slump thanks to the resilience in parts of the economy that has surprised many this year.

One element of the economy that is doing much better than expected is the property market and Rishi’s stamp duty holiday has come under fire for driving up house prices, so is it time to make it permanent, ease the need to rush and encourage people to move more often?

Also on this week’s podcast, Georgie and Simon look at the latest temperature check of Britain’s retirement prospects and how hard the pandemic has hit them.

And finally, buy a new appliance and it comes with a guarantee but do you really need to fill in that little form or go online to register it? Or is that just a swizz to get your personal details?

GDP dived at the start of lockdown and then bounced sharply back - has that recovery now been put on hold?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@House prices grew at the slowest pace since March last month, but they still picked up by a robust 7.6 per cent year-on-year, new figures by mortgage lender Halifax show.

The average UK home was priced at £261,221 in July, which marks a 0.4 per cent increase from the June, when prices had dipped by 0.6 per cent month-on-month.

Despite the slowdown, prices are only slightly below May's peak of £261,642 and still more than £18,500 higher than a year ago.

Cooling: Halifax said price growth will slow down, but it does not expect any falls this year

Halifax said the cooling in prices was to be expected, given the strong rise seen last summer when the stamp duty holiday was introduced and buyers were returning to the market after the first lockdown.

House price growth is set to keep slowing, Halifax said, but it did not forecast any falls for the rest of the year as the market remains 'solid' while the economy recovers.

Halifax's report contrasts with Nationwide's, which showed house prices dipped 0.5 per cent in July on a monthly basis. However, Nationwide reported a larger annual increase of 10.5 per cent.

'This easing was somewhat expected given the strength of price inflation seen last summer, as the market began its recovery from the first lockdown, and with activity supported by the start of the stamp duty holiday,' said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.

He added: 'Although there remains some uncertainty over the impact on employment from the unwinding of Government support schemes, on balance the risks to the macro-environment are receding, with consumer confidence improving, the labour market recovering, and the economy expanding as restrictions are lifted.

'Overall, assuming a continuation of recent economic trends, we expect the housing market to remain solid over the next few months, with annual price growth continuing to slow but remaining well into positive territory by the end of the year.'

Ups and downs: Annual house prices rose by 7.6 per cent, down from 8.7 per cent in June

As always, the picture across the country varied greatly, with some regions seeing much stronger growth than others.

Prices in Wales rose by the most at 13.8 per cent - the fastest growth in the country since 2005. Meanwhile Yorkshire saw prices rise 11 per cent which was the highest for over 16 years, Halifax said.

At the other end of the spectrum, prices in London rose by a much smaller 2.5 per cent.

Regional prices in July and annual increase East Midlands, £216,663, 9% Eastern England, £304,670, 7.1% London, £511,190, 2.5% North East, £153,235, 7.6% North West, £201,491, 10.4% Northern Ireland, £164,023, 8.9% Scotland, £184,933, 9% South East, £355,973, 7.4% South West, £271,752, 10% Wales, £194,918, 13.8% West Midlands, £221,526, 7.3% Yorkshire and the Humber, £186,321, 11%

The housing market has been booming during the past year, stoked by the stamp duty holiday, low interest rates and rising demand for larger homes due to the pandemic.

However, the stamp duty holiday will come to an end soon.

The 'nil rate' stamp duty band was reduced from £500,000 to £250,000 from July and it will revert to its standard rate of £125,000 in October, meaning many people putting offers in now are likely to miss out on any stamp duty savings.

But Halifax said a lack of supply would continue to push prices up.

'Latest industry figures show instructions for sale are falling and estate agents are experiencing a drop in their available stock,' Galley said.

'This general lack of supply should help to support prices in the near-term, as will the exceptionally low cost of borrowing and continued strong customer demand.'

Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent and a former RICS residential chairman, said: 'After a record-breaking June, the housing market is becoming accustomed to more 'normal' levels of activity but still above what we would reasonably expect at this time of year.

'There is no serious price correction or steep fall in transactions as these figures bear out. Certainly, we are seeing that nearly all sales agreed before the stamp duty concession began to taper off are proceeding and without price renegotiation.

'Available stock remains at low levels and this is continuing to support values, along with cheap mortgage rates.'

Latest industry figures by RICS show instructions for sale are falling and estate agents are experiencing a drop in their available stock

Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said there are 'good reasons' to think that house prices will stay elevated.

'These include government support to household incomes and ultra-low mortgage rates,' he said. 'While the former, notably the furlough scheme, will finish in the autumn, there seems little prospect of interest rates rising until well into next year, even after August’s MPC meeting delivered a more hawkish tone.'

'The pandemic has also had potentially long-lasting effects on property preferences, including a ‘race for space’ as people seek larger homes in a world of more home working. There is plenty of fuel for property deposits provided by the substantial savings accumulated by households during lockdowns.

'Meanwhile job and incomes losses during the pandemic have disproportionately affected younger, lower-paid, people who are generally not in the market to buy a property. So, there are good reasons to think house prices will stay elevated.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The chief executive of renewable energy giant Octopus Energy has called for a permanent price cap on energy bills to curb the impact of soaring gas prices.

On Friday, regulator Ofgem increased the price cap by £139 from October 1, pushing up the cost of energy bills for 11million households on variable standard tariffs this winter.

Ofgem said the record 12.2 per cent rise on annual bills, from £1,138 to £1,277, is due to a 50 per cent leap in wholesale energy costs over the first half of the year.

Octopus boss Greg Jackson said the higher bills would be difficult for many households – but that without the price cap, energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds.

Saving the planet: Environmental levies currently make up around 23% of electricity bills compared with less than two per cent of gas bills

He called for the cap – introduced in 2019 by then-Prime Minister Theresa May to end 'rip-off' energy prices – to be extended permanently beyond its current end in 2023. It has so far cut customers' energy bills by £1billion per year.

Jackson said: 'Keeping the price cap in place permanently is something we would love to see from the Government. I cannot see any reason why you'd ever take it away.

'If it weren't for the cap, the prices from the former Big Six suppliers would be between £1,360 and £1,500 each year, based on how they have priced in the past.

'It is colossal how much money the price cap is saving people. It has massively constrained bills despite the huge increases in the cost of energy.'

This month, global wholesale gas prices hit 111.4 pence per therm, or €42.19 per megawatt hour, up from 20.21 pence per therm or €7.73 per megawatt hour in August last year.

The spike in gas prices has been caused by soaring demand from China and India, combined with supply issues due to the pandemic.

Extreme weather patterns across the world have also pushed up demand and caused outages at production plants.

Over the year to date, Britain has imported 64 per cent of its energy, compared with 54 per cent in 2020 and 2019. The bulk of the imports came from Norway, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.

Ofgem increased the price cap by £139, pushing up the cost of energy bills for millions

Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the UK's demand for imported gas will rise 1.5 times by 2030 as its homegrown production falls by 71 per cent over the same period.

The UK no longer has any long-range gas storage and it has almost fully phased out coal generation. Murray Douglas, research director at Wood Mackenzie, said this means high energy prices are here to stay over the next decade.

He added: 'The global gas market will tighten considerably to 2025, with only a temporary reprieve next summer, and the UK will be more exposed to gas price volatility, particularly in winters. The winters through to 2025/26 will be the most challenging.'

The ICE futures index for natural gas shows UK prices climbing to around 144 pence per therm in January.

Energy consultancy Aurora Energy Research expects UK wholesale prices to then drop from current highs to average 52 pence per therm in the mid-2020s before rising to 63 pence per therm in the late-2020s.

Anise Ganbold, research leader at Aurora Energy, said: 'Beyond the late-2020s, we expect prices to continue to rise due to the UK's growing import dependency as its own North Sea production declines.'

Jackson said the UK can now produce electricity from wind at around 5p per kilowatt hour, compared with generating from gas which now costs 9p per kWh. But around 90 per cent of the energy used by dual-fuel customers in the UK still comes directly or indirectly from gas.

He said: 'We need to change that so we escape the soaring global fossil fuel prices, which are partly driven by the fact we are competing with Asia for gas.

'Britain is not in control of our energy prices and it would be great if we could take more control. If we have cheap renewable electricity generated here, it will make bills for UK households cheaper.'

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said last month he is looking at reducing electricity bills by shifting some of the environmental taxes on electricity to gas.

Environmental levies currently make up around 23 per cent of electricity bills compared with less than two per cent of gas bills.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Bank of England is likely to be the first major central bank to start raising interest rates – with hikes on the cards as early as mid-2022, HSBC has predicted.

Policymakers on Threadneedle Street were initially only expected to start lifting the bank rate from its record low of 0.1 per cent in late 2023 or early 2024.

But the spectre of soaring inflation is likely to push that decision forward, HSBC thinks, as the central bank tries to keep a lid on the rising cost of living.

The Bank of England is likely to be the first major central bank to start raising interest rates – with hikes on the cards as early as mid-2022, HSBC has predicted

As the bank released its half-year results, chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson said he thought it was possible the Bank of England’s base interest rate could start moving higher from the middle of 2022.

While higher interest rates would be bad for borrowers, they would be welcomed by long-suffering savers – and banks, which have been unable to make much money on the cash they lend out.

The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.1 per cent last year, in response to the pandemic. It hoped to encourage cash-strapped businesses to borrow cheaply, and push households and firms to spend rather than save as the economy stuttered.

But a debate is now raging within the central bank over when would be the best time to start lifting rates again. Some members of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee are worried that hiking rates too early could dampen the economic recovery.

But others fear that inflation, or rising prices, could spiral out of control if stimulus is left in place for too long. In its latest forecasts, thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said inflation could hit 3.9 per cent early next year – almost double the Bank of England’s target.

The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.1% last year

It added that this should fall back to 2 per cent the year after if the Bank started hiking rates, and advised the MPC to ‘prepare the ground for normalising its monetary policy stance’.

HSBC’s rate hike prediction came as the lender reported a surge in profits for the first half of 2021. It raked in £7.8 billion over the first six months of the year, compared to £3.1 billion a year earlier.

Last year HSBC squirreled away £4.4 billion to cover loans expected to turn sour – but it released £517 million of that during the first half, as the economy recovered better than expected. This was particularly the case in the UK, where HSBC has its headquarters.

‘The UK economy has rebounded strongly,’ said chief executive Noel Quinn. HSBC brought back its dividend after the lifting of Bank of England restrictions last month, announcing a 5p-pershare payout totalling £1 billion. The bank gave its bankers a pat on the back too, increasing their bonus pool by 50 per cent to £647 million. It will keep adding to this pile over the year before it pays out the sums next spring.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Can you tell me if, after my personal allowance has been reduced by subtracting my state pension to create my tax code, I should then be including my state pension amount when I fill in my self-assessment?

I must do a self-assessment because I also get some foreign pension as well as a small UK teacher’s pension here. I always submit the UK teacher’s pension amount and all foreign pensions on my self-assessment return, along with the state pension, each year.

However, now that I know the relationship between the tax code and personal allowances, I realise I am not getting my full personal allowance each year and I feel I am actually paying taxes twice on the state pension

Retirement finances: Am I paying tax on my state pension twice? (Stock image)

It does not feel logical to reduce my personal allowance to get the taxes in one instance and then charge me tax on the state pension again in my return.

Am I correct? I will appreciate if you could give me an answer to my query here as it troubles me a lot, even after I spoke to HMRC.

It is all pretty confusing and no one there will give me the reason in writing so I can digest it easily. I hope that you can either let me know if this is worth pursuing or where else I can get help with it.

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Steve Webb replies: The good news is that you are not being taxed twice on your state pension.

As you appreciate, state pensions and private pensions generally count as part of your taxable income. But whether you actually have to pay tax and, if so, how much tax, depends on how your total taxable income compares with your tax-free personal allowance.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

To work out your tax bill at the end of the year, HRMC first add up all of your pension income, plus any other taxable income such as income from property etc. Next, they deduct your personal allowance, which is currently £12,570.

If your total taxable income is under your personal allowance, no tax is due.

If your taxable income is in excess of your personal allowance, you pay tax on the excess.

Tax is charged first at the basic rate of 20 per cent and then at higher rates depending on how much excess taxable income you have. (Different rates and allowances apply to things like income from savings and from dividends).

Based on the description above, you are fine to provide HMRC with details of all of your pensions and other taxable income and they will check at the end of the year whether the correct amount of tax has been deducted over the course of the year.

However, what HMRC also do is try to deduct the right amount of tax each month through the year so that no end-year adjustment is needed. And the way that they do this causes some confusion.

For most people, the amount of state pension they get is under the tax threshold of £12,570. (There are some people who get more than this in state pension but they are a minority).

DWP pay your state pension gross – before the deduction of any tax. What HMRC then do is offset all of your state pension against your tax allowance, and then use any unused tax allowance as a tax code to be used by the Teachers’ Pension Scheme and other pension providers.

You could argue that this means you pay ‘not enough’ tax on your state pension and ‘too much’ tax on your teachers’ pension.

But the only thing that matters is that at the end of the year you have paid the right total amount of tax, and this system produces the correct outcome overall.

To give a simple example, suppose that your state pension is £8,570 per year and you have a private pension of £9,000 per year.

HMRC calculate that with a personal tax allowance of £12,570 you have £4,000 of ‘unused’ tax allowance once they have taken account of your state pension (from which no tax has been deducted by DWP).

They send a tax code for £4,000 to the private pension provider. This means that the first £4,000 of your private pension is tax free and the remaining £5,000 is taxed at the basic rate of 20 per cent.

Over the course of the year you will pay £1,000 in income tax through this route.

As it happens, all of that £1,000 will have been collected by your private pension provider and paid over to HMRC. But at the end of the year HMRC will do a check.

They will say your total income (state plus private) was £17,570, that you had a personal allowance of £12,570, so you have taxable income of £5,000 on which 20 per cent tax was due.

By the end of the year your tax return will show that you should have paid £1,000 in tax and this is exactly the amount which has been deducted on your behalf, so no further adjustment is needed.

I am aware that tax issues can be confusing, especially for those with more complex tax positions.

For anyone of modest means who needs help, I can recommend the charity ‘tax help for older people’ who have hundreds of expert volunteers who freely give their time to help people navigate the system. Their website is here.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I am 41 years old and have a Sipp currently worth £150,000. I currently contribute £16,000 to it annually. I am concerned about hitting the Lifetime Allowance and the tax implications.

If I reach 57 and am nearing the Lifetime Allowance could I crystallise my pension, start a drawdown but only take a nominal income from it, allowing the pot to continue to grow above the Lifetime Allowance and not trigger the extra 25 per cent tax?

I am confused by a lot of the advice online as even when they talk about the Lifetime Allowance limit, it uses examples of pension pots around £200k. I cannot find a place where the issue of a pension pot continuing to grow after crystallisation is addressed.

I doubt I will need to take a lump sum when I retire. I also use my annual LISA and ISA allowance.

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Retirement finances: I am 41 years old and have a SIPP currently worth £150,000

Steve Webb replies: The Lifetime Allowance creates a lot of confusion so it might be worth a recap of how it works before going on to address your specific question.

The purpose of the LTA, in simple terms, is to make sure that any given individual does not get more than their fair share of pension tax relief over the course of their lifetime.

Within limits, contributions into a pension are normally free of tax, money inside a pension pot builds up largely tax free, and a quarter of any pot can be taken as a tax free lump sum at the end – with the rest usually taxed as it is drawn out in the same way as any other income.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

This makes pensions attractive from a tax point of view (something the Treasury is very aware of) and that is why there has been a lifetime allowance since 2006.

What the LTA does is keeps a ‘running tally’ each time you set up some of your pension wealth for access.

In pensions jargon, each time you start to take some pension – for example, by retiring in a final salary pension scheme or by moving a pension pot into a drawdown product – this is called a ‘Benefit Crystallisation Event’.

There is a long list of these events, but in simple terms they are usually occasions when you move from building up a pension pot to drawing it. (They can also apply for lump sums and/or sometimes when you reach age 75).

Every time you crystallise some pension wealth, the pension provider measures the value of your withdrawal as a percentage of the prevailing LTA.

The current LTA is £1,073,100 and this will be frozen until 2026. If, for example, you currently took £10,731 out of a pension pot and used it all to buy an annuity you would get a letter from the annuity provider saying you have just used up 1 per cent of your LTA.

A similar calculation is done each time you crystallise your pension savings. When you ask your pension provider to use your money in this way they should ask you how much of your LTA you have used so far from previous crystallisations so that they can check you are still under 100 per cent.

If your crystallisations go above 100 per cent of your LTA, you haven’t broken the law, but you do face a tax charge.

This can work in one of two ways:

- If you are taking this latest slice out in full as a lump sum, the provider will deduct a 55 per cent LTA tax charge before giving you the money; no further tax is then due;

- If you are taking this latest slice in the form of income provision– for example, buying an annuity or putting it into a drawdown product from which you will take income as and when you want to – the provider will deduct a one off 25 per cent LTA tax charge at source and then deduct normal income tax on the balance as you draw it.

Get clued up: Steve Webb thinks our reader could benefit from speaking to an adviser

In many cases this means that, by the time money is being paid out to you, any LTA issues around that money will have been dealt with.

However, there is a catch which may be very relevant to what you are suggesting. For drawdown products, as well as testing against the Lifetime Allowance when you move the pension pot into the product , the provider has to do a further test when you turn 75. This would pick up any growth in your drawdown pot since you first set it up.

For most people, most of the time, this would not be an issue. This could be because they steadily take money out of their drawdown pot (and paying regular income tax as they go) with the result that the pot was lower at age 75 than when it was set up. In this case no further LTA would be used up.

But if you were to do as you suggest and take ‘nominal’ income which was lower than the investment returns then the increase in the pot would count against your LTA at age 75.

This is not a problem if you still have spare LTA at that point. But if you had already used up 100 per cent of your LTA at age 57 when you moved money into the product (and/or from pension savings anywhere else), you would face an LTA tax charge at age 75.

One way round this would be to ensure that you have taken out all the investment growth before the age of 75, though you would face income tax on such withdrawals.

Whilst I can’t give you individual financial advice, a decision on whether to stop pension saving later in life might be influenced by your employment status at the time.

If, at that stage, you are a member of a workplace pension scheme which benefits from an employer contribution, it might work out for the best to continue saving in a pension even though you expect those funds will take you over the LTA.

This is because the value of the ‘free’ employer pension contribution could more than offset the tax charge that will be generated.

As you will see, these are complex areas and the rules by the time you are old enough to access your pension could be very different.

For that reason I would strongly encourage you to take independent financial advice, especially if we are talking about how to make best use of a £1million plus pension pot and other savings.

Indeed, I would encourage you to speak to an adviser now who could review whether your current combination of pension plus LISA plus ISA is the right mix going forward.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lloyds Bank has launched a new credit card enabling customers to earn cashback every time they spend.

Customers earn 0.25 per cent on every pound spent up to £4,000 and 0.5 per cent for each £1 spent over that amount.

New customers will also receive a £20 cashback incentive when they spend £1,000 within the first three months.

Customers can keep track of the rewards building up as the cashback amounts will be visible on their monthly statements.

Any cashback earned will accumulate over the calendar year and will be paid directly into the customer's credit card account every January as a lump sum.

Elyn Corfield, managing director at Lloyds Bank, said: 'We're excited to have launched our new cashback credit card, rewarding customers for every purchase they make.

'Whether it's day to day spend on groceries, clothes or restaurants, our customers will be able to earn money back, which is then saved and paid into their account at the beginning of each year.'

How does it stack up?

Shoppers who are keen to put the past 18 months behind them and start spending on the activities and events they have felt so deprived of, may well consider this simple cashback offering.

However, the returns on offer are modest and although the £20 incentive for spending £1,000 in the first three months represents a 2 per cent return, the 0.25 per cent interest on your first £4,000 each year will only generate £10 cashback.

For someone who spends £1,000 each month over 12 months they could expect to earn a total of £70 in cashback given the starter incentive and the 0.5 per cent return for expenditure above £4000.

For cashback enthusiasts, Lloyds' new credit card goes head-to-head with the American Express cashback cards.

Lloyds' unveiling is well timed given that Amex has cut its rates.

Amex cardholders' cashback rates will be cut by as much as 50 per cent in some cases from this week.

The cashback cuts relate to its free Platinum Cashback Everyday Card and its Platinum Cashback Card which comes with a £25 annual fee.

Its free customers currently receive 1 per cent cashback when spending more than £5,000 annually, but under the changes any spending up to £10,000 will only earn 0.5 per cent.

Paying card holders will earn 0.75 per cent cashback on spending up to £10,000, down from the current rate of 1 per cent.

Michelle Stevens, deputy editor at the personal finance comparison site, Finder said: 'Unlike some of the Amex range, the Lloyds deal doesn't come with an annual fee attached.

'However, an annual fee can be worth shouldering if the value of the cashback you'd earn – plus any other perks – outweigh that fee.'

Some UK retailers don't accept Amex due to the fact that it charges them around 3 per cent for each sale they make.

For those nervous about having any fee attached to their card then the main competitor is Amex's free Platinum Cashback Everyday Card.

Its 0.5 per cent interest on all spending up to £10,000 and 1 per cent beyond that, is more generous than what Lloyds is offering.

New cardmembers also get 5 per cent cashback on their purchases - up to a limit of £100 - for the first three months after joining - much better than the £20 incentive offered by Lloyds.

It's also worth pointing out that not all retailers accept American Express. It charges merchants more than Mastercard and Visa for each sale they make which means some retailers choose to avoid Amex cards altogether.

There are now very few major chains that don't accept it, but you are much more likely to have an issue when in smaller shops throughout the UK.

However, some notable organisations still don't accept Amex including Tile Giant, Dunelm and Sky.

The only other comparable cashback deal is offered by Santander, which comes with a monthly fee of £3, or £36 a year, and has an APR of 23.7 per cent.

Its All in One Credit Card Mastercard pays 0.5 per cent cashback on purchases, and offers a range of other benefits, such as no foreign transaction fees on purchases made abroad.

Meanwhile Barclaycard, which has been in the headlines in May for announcing drastic cuts to borrowers' credit limits, offers a card which pays 0.25 per cent cashback on all purchases.

It also comes with fee-free overseas spending and an APR of 22.9 per cent.

By contrast, the Lloyds cashback credit card has an APR of 19.9 per cent whilst the fee-free Amex has an APR of 22.2 per cent.

Verdict?

Choosing the best credit card like with many things boils down to whether the benefits on offer are best suited to your circumstances.

It may be that you are looking for a card to clear debt – and in that case, a balance transfer credit card might work best.

This allows customers to pay off debts by transferring the entire debt over to the new card, often with the promise of 0 per cent interest for a fixed period of time.

Or equally, you may be optimistic that with the vaccine rollout in full swing, you'll soon be making up for lost time by holidaying abroad and therefore require a credit card best suited to overseas spending.

But if you decide a cashback or rewards credit card is for you, then much depends won how much money you spend and how you spend it.

If you are a big spender then you may want to consider a card that compliments this such as Amex's Preferred Rewards Gold Credit Card.

Although it comes with a £140 annual fee due after the first year it offers cardmembers 20,000 bonus points when they spend £3,000 in their first three months - which is enough for a £100 gift card from Amazon and it can also be converted into Avios points.

Cardmembers then earn one Membership Reward point for every £1 they spend and can now also get £5 back twice every month by spending on Deliveroo.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ladbrokes owner Entain has more than quadrupled its profits thanks to higher levels of online betting and a full sporting calendar that included the Euro 2020 football tournament.

Profits climbed to £90.9million in the first six months of 2021, compared to £22.4million in the same period last year, as strong digital trading helped offset the damaging effects of store closures on retail sales.

The company even said the longer-than-expected length of lockdown restrictions bolstered its online business, as sport continued while people were told to stay home, and net gaming revenues shot up by over a quarter to £1.59billion.

Sporting occasion: Events like the Aintree Grand National, Euro 2020 and Cheltenham Festival helped Entain's net gaming revenues shot up by over a quarter to £1.59billion

Its UK business benefited from the hosting of sporting events that were cancelled last year, such as the Aintree Grand National, as well as new product releases like the Ladbrokes 5-a-side betting game.

But it also said its new acquisitions, Bet-pt in Portugal and Baltics-based Enlabs, performed very well, as did its Australian division which hired Hollywood star Mark Wahlberg to front an advertising campaign

However, the Foxy Bingo operator was severely impacted in Germany by new taxes and regulations on sports licences to combat problem gambling, and its NGR in the country fell by about a third.

Entain shares closed trading 1.2 per cent lower at 1,942.5p on Thursday.

By contrast, Entain's joint venture in the United States, BetMGM, continued to benefit from the growing deregulation of sports gambling in the country following the US Supreme Court's decision three years ago to overturn a law that effectively outlawed such an activity.

Having launched sports betting into three more states, Virginia, Iowa and Michigan, BetMGM is now in 13 states compared with three at the beginning of 2020 and expects to be in a total of 20 within the next 12 months.

The college basketball tournament March Madness earned the joint venture a record amount of new customers during the first quarter, and it commands a 30 per cent share of iGaming in the US.

American giant: Entain's joint US venture, BetMGM, launched sports betting in three more states and now has the second-largest market share in sports betting and iGaming the US

In comparison, overall retail revenues plummeted by 46 per cent to £191.3million, with the worst decline happening in Italy where it dived by 90 per cent, while it also fell by around two-thirds in the Republic of Ireland and Belgium.

All its establishments have reopened, though, and since restrictions have been loosened in the UK, volumes have returned to 90 per cent of their pre-pandemic levels.

Chief executive Jette Nygaard-Andersen stated the 'quality and diversification of our businesses has enabled us to deliver our 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit online growth, while also making excellent progress on our strategic priorities.

'This performance is not only a result of our industry-leading technology, but also the hard work and dedication of our talented teams of people around the world, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them.'

Closures: Lockdown restrictions that forced Entain to close its stores for part of the period caused its retail revenues to plummet by 46 per cent to £191.3million

The FTSE 100 business, which also owns Coral and online brand Sportingbet, forecasts full-year underlying earnings will come in at between £850million and £900million because of the impressive results.

In spite of this, Entain is not paying an interim dividend and does not expect to start rewarding investors until its full-year results are published in March next year, assuming that Covid-19 restrictions further loosen.

Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'Ultimately the results from Entain took a positive tone, but easier comparisons from 2020 when sports were on hold added wind to Entain's sails.

'The group looks to be on solid footing, but as the stock is currently priced to perfection, we'll need more evidence to be fully convinced.'

Lamborghini's iconic eighties poster supercar, the Countach, has been reborn for 2021 with a modern twist on the famed wedge-shape and a hybrid power unit producing a massive 803bhp.

The new Countach LPI 800-4 has been revealed at Monterey Car Week at Pebble Beach, California, and is a futuristic homage to the original car that first saw the light of day - in concept form - 50 years ago.

It is powered by the same hybrid system as the Italian car maker's limited-edition Sián hypercar, using the 6.5-litre V12 engine and supercapacitor technology to boost performance and efficiency.

The stunning retro-inspired two-seater will hit 62mph in 2.8 seconds and has a top speed of 221mph. Prices start from around £2million.

Countach on the comeback trail: Lamborghini has resurrected one of its most iconic names with a modern tribute to the eighties pin-up supercar

Only 112 examples will be built at the Italian marque's Sant'Agata Bolognese factory.

But don't log into your online banking or start rustling through the drawers to find your chequebook just yet, because they're already sold out.

Lamborghini has for weeks been sneaking details of the all-new Countach to existing customers, via its exclusive app - and all 112 have been snapped up by eager enthusiasts desperate to get their hands on the returning legend.

Its full name - LPI 800-4 - denotes the incredible performance figures of the new Countach.

'LPI' is short for 'Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido', which loosely translates to it having a longitudinally mounted engine positioned in the middle - though towards the rear - of the car with a hybrid system. The '800' figure is a reference to it having in excess of 800bhp and the '4' represents the fact it is all-wheel drive.

An icon returns: It has been half a century since the original Countach sent tongues wagging. In 2021, Lamborghini aims to achieve the same result with this, the new LPI 800-4

‹ Slide me › Look familiar? The iconic wedge shape, bulking shoulder vents and triangular slashes in the doors have all been carried over from the original Countach to the new LPI 800-4 version

Lamborghini says the new limited edition car 'pays homage to the Countach's iconic status as a revolutionary design and technology rulebreaker, recreated for the 21st century'.

It will be one of the final high-performance road cars launched by the brand with a monumental V12 engine - and also the last to have supercapacitor technology.

This is unique from a traditional hybrid vehicle with a supplementary battery, with the supercapacitor acting as an electrical component that stores energy that can offer a kick of performance to an already mind-bogglingly potent supercar.

As drama goes, the new Countach has it in droves. It's just a shame a little over 100 examples are going to be produced

Low, long, wedge-shaped and with a long tapered bonnet - the Countach certainly fits the mould of the original supercar

The new Countach will be part of a swansong for the brand's monumental V12 engine - and also the last to have supercapacitor technology, which debuted in another limited edition model in 2019

While many will argue that it could never live up to the 'poster car' reputation the original had, there's no doubting the new version shares lots of DNA with the Countach that many petrolheads would dream about

The V12 petrol engine produces a total of 769bhp alone, while the 48-volt electric motor delivering power from the supercapacitor adds another 34bhp to the equation.

Not only does this translate to a zero-to-62mph sprint time of less than three seconds, it will hit 124mph in 8.6 seconds and continue accelerating beyond the magical 200mph mark.

The car features a monocoque chassis and all the body panels are in carbon fibre to keep weight down and retain as much torsional stiffness. Lamborghini says it tips the scales - dry - at 1,595kg.

The LPI 800-4 name explained: 'LPI' is short for 'Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido', which loosely translates to it having a longitudinally mounted engine positioned in the middle - though towards the rear - of the car with a hybrid system.

'The engineering team that developed the original Countach advanced Lamborghini’s pioneering technical approach, delivering unexpected innovations and the best performance available in a production car,' explains Lamborghini chief technology officer, Maurizio Reggiani.

'That spirit inherently drives Lamborghini R&D, resulting in the pioneering hybrid technology in the LPI 800-4, and the emotive driving experience and top-line performance expected from a flagship V12 Lamborghini.'

Only 112 examples of the 2021 model will be built at the Italian marque's Sant'Agata Bolognese factory. Lamborghini originally built just under 2,000 Countach models over a 16-year production series running from 1974 to 1990

Design inspirations from the original Countach

In terms of design, Lamborghini says the LPI 800-4 is 'instantly recognisable as the elevated descendant of Countach generations' and is 'testament to the lasting impact of the original Countach design that became the poster car of the 1980s and a symbol of automotive and lifestyle ultra-cool'.

The Countach's distinctive wedge-shaped silhouette with straight lines running from front to rear have been mimicked on a modern Lamborghini shell, with designers tasked to incorporate as many sharp angles and flat edges to pay homage to the original.

Importantly, it retains the renowned scissor doors, which were first introduced on the Countach and have become a signature feature of all V12-powered Lambos through the ages.

While a number of more extreme - big-winged - versions of the initial Countach were launched in its 16-year production life and became the pin-ups of a generation, the new model is a tribute to the LP500 concept revealed at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971 and the early examples that followed when the customer-ready model was built from 1974.

It retains the distinctive Countach face and flat bonnet.

Bosses say the new car takes inspiration taken from the Quattrovalvole edition with assertive lines on the hood, a low rectangular grille and headlights, as well as in the wheel arches with their hexagonal theme. The sharp inclination of the glass 'greenhouse' engine cover adopts the straight lines redolent of the original Countach.

Like the enigmatic original, it features airscoops in the shoulders of the car, the triangular cut-out in the doors and those Countach 'gills' - which are synonymous with the original's design - to the rear of the windows.

'Distinctive Periscopio lines running through the roof to the rear of the car, particularly distinctive if viewed from above, appear to float towards the rear of the car,' design bosses explain.

It uses 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels with a design inspired by supercars of the eighties, though this time fitted with carbon ceramic brake discs and super-sticky Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres

Left to right: Mitja Borkert, head of design; Stephan Winkelmann, president and CEO; Maurizio Reggiani, chief technology officer

The Countach was the first Lamborghini not to be associated with famous bulls and bullfighting. The name originated from the word 'contacc', an exclamation of astonishment in the Piedmontese language. The Diablo - translating to Devil - followed suit when it replaced the Countach in 1990

The rear of the Countach LPI 800-4 is also recognisable as a tribute to the eighties bedroom-wall-favourite, though not quite as book-ended as the original design.

It keeps the top-mounted engine cover from the original and also replicates the slatted panel, though with a modern twist using a stepped glass design.

The rear bumper features a lower, sleeker line, and the 'hexagonita' theme also runs into the three-unit rear light clusters.

Prices start from around £1.7million before local taxes. With VAT included, British buyers fortunate enough to land one will be paying over £2million for the new Countach

‹ Slide me › These images show the scissor doors in action. Since the Countach hit showrooms in 1974, Lamborghini enthusiasts have expected the brand's V12 supercars to have awesome door opening and closing systems

The LPI 800-4 sports the four-strong exhaust tail pipes of the Countach family, connected within the carbon fibre rear diffuser.

It uses 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels with a design inspired by supercars of the eighties, though this time fitted with carbon ceramic brake discs and super-sticky Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres.

The 112 owners of the exclusive limited edition Countach LPI 800-4 can choose from a range of heritage exterior paint options, mostly in solid colours, such as the iconic Impact White, Giallo and Verde Medio.

More contemporary new colours including grey, purple and blue join these options.

There's just as many options for the interior, with the cabin also featuring an exclusive 8.4-inch HDMI central touchscreen and an enormous high-definition digital instrument cluster.

Buyers will be able to spec their new Countach in the same Impact White colour driven by Jordan Belfort - played by Leonardo DiCaprio - in 2013 hit film, The Wolf of Wall Street. Directors infamously trashed a genuine Countach for the film's iconic scene where Belfort drives the Lamborghini home while intoxicated by a cocktail of alcohol and drugs

Lamborghini has already offered the new Countach to its most esteemed customers via the brand's exclusive app. Buyers around the world will be begin to take deliveries of from the first quarter of 2022

'The Countach is one of the most significant and exciting cars in automotive history'

Unveiling the car in California, company president and CEO, Stephan Winkelmann said: 'The Countach LPI 800-4 is a visionary car of the moment, just as its forerunner was.

'One of the most important automotive icons, the Countach not only embodies the design and engineering tenet of Lamborghini but represents our philosophy of reinventing boundaries, achieving the unexpected and extraordinary and, most importantly, being the 'stuff of dreams'.

Could the Countach also be a pin-up poster car for the current generation of budding petrolheads? It has a strong chance

With pop-up headlights all but banned due to pedestrian safety requirements of new cars, the Countach replicates the flush lamps used in earlier versions of the original

Only a limited-edition car can demand an asking price of £2million. That will partly explain why units are not as high as the 1,983 Countach model built across a 16-year production cycle

With just 112 being produced at the Italian marque's Sant'Agata Bolognese factory, there will be one new Countach for every 17 original cars

'The Countach LPI 800-4 pays homage to this Lamborghini legacy but it is not retrospective: it imagines how the iconic Countach of the 70s and 80s might have evolved into an elite super sports model of this decade.

'It upholds the Lamborghini tradition of looking forward, of exploring new design and technology avenues while celebrating the DNA of our brand. It is a Lamborghini that innately expresses the marque's enduring and emotive power: always inspirational and thrilling to see, hear and most of all drive.'

Recognised as one of the greatest supercars of all time, the Countach's wedge-shaped design - penned by Marcello Gandini - and scissor doors were a huge departure from Lamborghini's original high-performance model, the Miura.

'The Countach is one of the most significant and exciting cars in automotive history as well as in Lamborghini's heritage,' explained Mitja Borkert, Lamborghini head of design

The original model's V12 engine goes down as a legend in the automotive world - mounted longways at the rear to provide extra space for the cabin - something the new version has replicated

The original Countach was the first Lamborghini to debut scissor doors. The brand is now synonymous with them. Other supercars are now judged by how their doors open

Lamborghini announced earlier this year that every model in its range will have a hybrid version (like the new Countach) by the end of 2024. Its first fully-electric car will be unveiled in 2025

Its V12 engine also goes down as a legend in the automotive world - mounted longways at the rear to provide extra space for the cabin.

The original also boasted side-mounted radiators from Formula One, a forward-facing gearbox and tubular spaceframe technology never seen before on a road car.

In total, fewer than 2,000 examples were built between 1974 and production ending in 1990, when it was replaced by the equally-adored and just-as-bonkers Diablo.

Like the enigmatic original, it features airscoops in the shoulders of the car that give it a muscular, hunkered presence

The triangular cut-out sections in the doors have been retained, as have the 'gills' - which are synonymous with the original Countach's design - to the rear of the side windows

Bosses say they tried to capture the impact of the original. 'The Countach was provocative and polarizing, it made people smile and stare, but its infamous recognisability demonstrates the purity of its design legacy,' its design head says

Recognised as one of the greatest supercars of all time, the Countach's original wedge-shaped design - penned by Marcello Gandini - and scissor doors were a huge departure from Lamborghini's original high-performance model, the Miura. You could argue the new Countach does look somewhat similar to other extreme Lambo models released in recent years

The Countach was the first Lamborghini not to be associated with famous bulls and bullfighting. The name originated from the word 'contacc', an exclamation of astonishment in the Piedmontese language. The Diablo - translating to Devil - followed suit.

'The Countach is one of the most significant and exciting cars in automotive history as well as in Lamborghini's heritage,' explained Mitja Borkert, Lamborghini head of design.

'The Countach LPI 800-4 project is an incomparable design opportunity: to take a car so important and continue its evolution into a new era is a unique privilege.

'The Countach was provocative and polarizing, it made people smile and stare, but its infamous recognisability demonstrates the purity of its design legacy: the Countach LPI 800-4 elevates that clarity to a new level, celebrated in an exclusive limited edition to take its place in motoring history.'

Returning CEO, Stephan Winkelmann, is back at Lamborghini to spearheads the biggest transition in the history of the motor car - the switch to electric. However, it has acknowledged the importance of recognising the brand's past - especially with the return of the Countach name

‹ Slide me › Performance of the new car will be very special indeed. It will accelerate from 0-62mph in 2.8 seconds, from 0-124mph in 8.6 seconds and to a top speed of 221mph. But do you think it looks as good as the original Countach? That's up to you to decide

With such a low production run - and incredible looks - the new Lamborghini Countach LPI 800-4 is likely to draw crowds wherever it goes

A new poster car for the end of an internal combustion engine era: If there was ever a fitting tribute to petrol power and the remarkable V12 engine, the new Lamborghini Countach is just that

Those who have been fortunate enough - and rich enough - to get their name down on one of the 112 cars being made will have to pay from just over €2million (approx £1.7million). With VAT and other charges thrown in, Lamborghini officials say it would be around £2million for customers in the UK.

Buyers around the world will take deliveries from the first quarter of 2022. Lucky sods!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gatwick airport's boss says airlines such as British Airways should 'use or lose' their landing slots.

In what may be seen as a shot across the bows of BA – which halted short-haul flights from Gatwick last year – Stewart Wingate said other airlines were lining up to take the slots.

Going nowhere: British Airways halted short-haul flights from Gatwick last year

He told The Mail on Sunday: 'BA has already made public their position that because of the slot waiver they'll not be flying short-haul during this summer season.

'If BA were to consider selling their slots, we know there's demand from the likes of easyJet, Wizz Air and others to take the slots from them.'

He added: 'Virgin has made clear to us they certainly will be maintaining their slot portfolio. We do expect Virgin and Delta to start flying in the months ahead.'

Wingate said the Government needs to bring back rules – suspended to help airlines through Covid – that force carriers to use their spaces.

He added: 'One of the things that's holding us back is the 'slot waiver' the British Government continues to put in place.

'We're certainly pressing the Government for the summer of 2022 to put the right incentives in place to have airlines use the scarce slots that are available.'

He warned that the UK is lagging Europe, which has already brought back rules so airlines must 'use or lose' their spaces this winter.

Gatwick last week reported a net loss of £245million in the first half of the year as passenger numbers plunged to 569,000.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In June, French-Israeli telecoms tycoon Patrick Drahi took a 12.1 per cent stake in BT

Telecoms group BT is poised to appoint City veteran and former ITV boss Adam Crozier as chairman.

Crozier, who is expected to resign as chairman of Asos to make time, is tipped to take the role after emerging as a candidate earlier this year.

In June, French-Israeli telecoms tycoon Patrick Drahi took a 12.1 per cent stake in BT.

It is thought his interest could trigger corporate activity later this year.

Crozier, who has also run Royal Mail, was ITV chief executive for seven years before stepping down in 2017. The broadcaster was regarded as a takeover target for much of his time at the helm.

He is also chairman of Premier Inn owner Whitbread and data firm Kantar, roles he is expected to keep according to the Times website which first reported the news yesterday.

Other candidates for the BT job were former Barclays UK chairman Sir Ian Cheshire and former RBS chief Stephen Hester.

Asos and BT declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@White collar workers are increasingly returning to their London offices, two UK property firms said yesterday.

Office space provider IWG reported a ‘very strong recovery’ and said occupancy rates were bouncing back after coronavirus restrictions lifted.

And Derwent, a London-focused landlord, placed a fresh £200million bet on the city’s property market as it predicted that demand for high-quality space would continue.

Office workers arrive at Victoria Station in London. Flexible office space provider IWG reported a ‘very strong recovery’ and said occupancy rates in the capital were bouncing back

It has bought two buildings in the ‘knowledge quarter’ in Euston Road and Tottenham Court Road, where many life science organisations are based.

But both firms think hybrid working will continue, with staff coming into work two or three days per week.

WFH threat to the young Younger office workers will struggle to climb the corporate ladder if they don’t return to the office, a top asset manager claims. Stephen Bird, whose company has changed its name from Standard Life Aberdeen to ‘Abrdn’, said staff would not be noticed, echoing Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s comments last week. Firms are deciding whether or not to bring staff back five days a week. Bird said: ‘I don’t think I would’ve been noticed on Zoom. I was very fortunate to be able to come in and see other people operating and emulate some of their behaviour’. Abrdn posted a 77 per cent jump in first-half profits to £163million. Rival M&G said it had swung to a £248million half-year loss, from a £826million profit.

Despite this, Derwent boss Paul Williams predicted a ‘war for space’, claiming tenants wanted ‘the right space, not just the cheapest space’.

Derwent said rental income in the first half of 2021 rose from £84.4million to £90.1million, with office rent collection rates for the June quarter at 95 per cent.

The value of its portfolio fell from £5.4billion to £5.38billion, compared to a year earlier. Shares rose 1.6 per cent, or 61p, to 3772p.

Meanwhile, IWG is seeking to capitalise on the shift to flexible working by opening new branches outside London. The company, formerly known as Regus, said it added more than 900 business customers in the first half of 2021.

Boss and founder Mark Dixon said: ‘This fundamental shift in the way people work is clearly a positive tailwind and we are seeing increasing levels of interest from enterprises wishing to transform their working practices.’

But revenues still took a hit, falling 19.3 per cent to £1.1billion in the six months to June 30.

Losses narrowed from £237.8million to £191.9million. Its occupancy rate was 66.2 per cent, down from 73.4 per cent a year earlier. Shares rose 2.7 per cent, or 8.6p, to 328p.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As coronavirus shut down economies around the world, Japan stood out as one of the countries that managed to avoid a hard lockdown.

There were fears that Japan with its elderly population would suffer heavily in the coronavirus pandemic, but deaths have been low and its cash-rich companies have proved robust.

Japan’s economy has taken a hit but Nicholas Weindling, manager of the JP Morgan Japanese Investment Trust, says that the country has not been affected as badly as many people thought it would be.

Does that mean that the land of the rising sun – thought of by many investors as the land of the false dawn – presents an opportunity for investors in the coronavirus storm?

Nicholas, who is based in Tokyo, joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter on this episode of the Investing Show to discuss how Japan has weathered Covid-19 and where he sees long-term prospects for growth in its stock market.

The fund manager argues that while many investors will think of global big name Japanese companies when they consider the country, this is not where the chances to profit lie.

Instead, he says that the companies further down the scale tapping into Japan’s consumer economy and helping fellow businesses adapt to the digital world can provide returns.

He says: ‘We’re investing in great companies that happen to be in Japan, not in the Japanese market itself.’

Nicholas says that while people often think of Japan as a very high-tech country – and in some places, such as Tokyo it is – much of the rest of the nation has some catching up to do with the rest of the world

He says: ‘In many ways Japan is lagging behind the rest of the world and that is the key opportunity. In Japan e-commerce is only about 8 per cent of total sales. It’s still very low and that is an opportunity.’

He also cites Japan’s low level of card payments, with 80 per Nicholas Weindling cent of transactions still done in cash – something which he says is going to change.

Nicholas argues that this means that for investors this means that the country’s companies have further to run in terms of growth that other major markets, such as the US, where much of the digital world’s gains have already been made.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The desire to look after the planet better has led to a huge rise in interest in drawing more of the energy we use from renewable and less polluting sources.

Yet, for investors this presents a conundrum. The old energy sector - represented by oil, gas, coal and electricity – has been a rich source of profits and dividends, so will they have to forgo these in the future - or could backing the new energy sector instead deliver the returns they desire, whilst also protecting the world we live in?

A handful of investment trusts and funds offer the opportunity to try to do this, combined with the specialist knowledge needed to sift the wheat from the chaff. We speak to Chris Tanner, of JLEN, Environmental Assets Group, which invests directly into projects to deliver income for investors and currently yields 5.6 per cent, to find out more.

In our interview he explains how the trust invests, what it looks for in renewable energy and other green infrastructure investments and why its 18 per cent share price rise this year reflects a surge in interest from big and small investors.

The trust has ongoing charges of 1.3 per cent and its share price has shifted to a hefty 16.7 per cent premium to its net asset value, albeit it has often traded around 10 per cent mark over the past five years.

Dividends are paid four times a year and Chris explains that he believes the share price performance and premium is down to a combination of the search for yield, institutional and personal investing interest in renewable energy and its solid inflation-linked returns on investment.

In addition to providing an income, such investments can help reduce the major carbon emissions and waste products of the traditional energy sector.

The sun, wind and water can all provide substantial amounts of power, meanwhile technologies can be used to reduce waste and turn some of it into an energy source. Such plants can also cut rubbish going to landfill, boost recycling and produce organic fertiliser.

With pressure mounting to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, cut carbon emissions and reduce waste, investing in the companies putting such technology into action can offer a way to tap into potential returns.

Of course, for any infrastructure investment politics can be a risk and we ask Chris how much of a concern this is for the trust and its investors.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Income investors are always on the hunt for steady and strong dividends, but many of them would not consider Asia to be the place to go looking.

However, Mike Kerley, of Henderson Far East Income has rewarded investors willing to back his investment trust with a solid stream of dividends combined with share price growth in recent years.

The trust has a total return of 151.6 per cent over the past decade and 46 per cent over the past three years, while currently yielding 5.98 per cent.

So why should investors look to Asia for income? Mike joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter on the latest investing Show to explain how he looks for high dividends, combined with value and a solid balance sheet that has the backing of lots of cash.

He looks for a combination of companies that offer either high yields and sustainable dividends, or those that offer potential dividend growth such as Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates.

Mike also eyes those companies that can use that cash pile to fund dividend growth in the future.

Mike explains how he looks for companies for the trust, why maturing businesses in Asia offer good opportunities and the growth in Asia should back up their future prospects – and he gives his thoughts on what may happen next for China.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Philip Morris International and a US private equity behemoth are set to go head-to-head in an auction for British inhaler maker Vectura.

The face-off aims to break a to-and-fro takeover battle that has seen the tobacco giant and The Carlyle Group put in multiple offers in a matter of weeks for the Chippenham-based business.

All three companies have agreed that the five-day auction – which will be overseen by the Takeover Panel – is the best way to break the deadlock.

Takeover target: Philip Morris and The Carlyle Group have both put in multiple offer for British inhaler maker Vectura in a matter of weeks

The aim of the auction is to get to the point where Philip Morris and Carlyle have made final offers, which they will not be able to change.

This is the only way to resolve the bidding war, otherwise each firm could, if regulators allowed it, keep leapfrogging one another for many more weeks.

And fears are growing that Vectura could be kept under lengthy siege if the pair are left to continue.

Sky’s takeover in 2018 was settled by a one-day auction process, which resulted in a blockbuster £31billion deal from Comcast.

Vectura has previously warned that business is starting to slow in the wake of the frenzy.

Shares in the FTSE 250-listed company rose 5.5 per cent, or 9p, to 173p, as traders priced in the next stage of the stand-off.

The unusual move comes after Marlboro-maker Philip Morris – known as PMI – made a £1.02billion offer for Vectura on Sunday.

This was just two days after Carlyle offered £928million.

Vectura had backed Carlyle’s latest bid – but decided to withdraw support yesterday and refused to recommend the PMI offer, creating an impasse.

Vectura specialises in making inhalers and nebulisers, but it also helps top drug companies convert their medicines into powders that can be inhaled. Customers include Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Glaxosmithkline.

If PMI or Carlyle puts forward a final offer for Vectura by 5pm today, the auction will not go ahead.

But if neither does, the process begins and will last five working days from tomorrow until August 17, or until a day when neither side puts in a new offer.

Each day the companies will announce their latest price to the stock market, so investors will be able to track bids.

When the auction ends, Vectura will be left with two final offers which it will then be able to weigh up. If it decides to recommend one then it will go to a shareholder vote, which needs to win 75 per cent of the ballot.

The battle has been highly controversial, with many in the City keen for Vectura neither to become victim to yet another private equity swoop nor for a company that treats lung conditions to fall into the hands of Big Tobacco.

But PMI boss Jacek Olczak said taking over Vectura would help it become a ‘broader health and wellness company’.

The company is aiming to eventually stop selling cigarettes. However, tobacco products still account for 75 per cent of its sales and its move has triggered outrage from health campaigners, with the British Thoracic Society saying it presents an ‘unresolvable ethical conflict’. The European Respiratory Society said it was ‘very alarmed’.

Carlyle is keen to expand the business and it already has support from 11pc of shareholders for its bid. But private equity firms have a torrid reputation for breaking firms up after just a few years and selling off the pieces.

Some observers believe the Vectura board could plump for Carlyle even if PMI puts in a bid that is higher, on the grounds that it is better for the company’s overall long-term interest.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‘It’s a high-stakes decision for Vectura, with the board coming under fire from some for even considering the bid from tobacco giant Philip Morris.

The importance of companies on the front line like Vectura, and its partnership with UK-based Inspira, has become even more important in the context of Covid.’

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The UK’s official inflation figure more than doubled to 1.5 per cent in April, it emerged this week, as the stronger than expected recovery continued to push up the cost of living.

Meanwhile, as we discussed on last week’s podcast, a wave of demand is meeting a shortage of supply for some items, sparking fears of an inflationary spike.

But while this is bad news for the pound in your pocket – which will buy less – and for savers, who will see their measly interest rates fail to keep up with how inflation erodes their cash, wasn’t the whole point of all that money printing and rate cutting to get a stronger recovery and inflation back towards the 2 per cent target?

On this week's podcast, Georgie Frost, George Nixon and Simon Lambert look at why inflation has become a hot topic, how it will affect savers and investors, and what it could mean for the game we all thought we could stop playing for some time: when will interest rates rise?

George runs through the impact for savers, who now can't find an account that beats inflation, but he explains a trick to get a better rate through laddering.

That collective cash pile has been built up by those who have been fortunate enough not to see their finances hit by the pandemic, but have seen their outgoings drop substantially.

We’ve already seen some big spending themes come out of this, as people splash out on everything from home improvements, to luxury garden furniture, expensive pizza ovens and hot tubs.

The expectation is that as lockdown eases and people are released into the hoped for freedom that vaccines bring, they will go on a spending spree.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Battleground: Major banks are locked in a mortgage price war as they scramble to lend

Goldman Sachs has warned that strict banking rules have triggered a mortgage price war which experts say is driving the cheapest home loans on record and sending house prices through the roof.

The US investment bank believes the performance of high street banks is coming under mounting pressure as they scramble to lend to home buyers at ever lower rates.

Tough 'ring-fencing' rules imposed on banks after the financial crisis were aimed at ensuring that billions in customer savings could not be funnelled into 'casino' investment banking operations.

But this has made banks pile into the mortgage market – considered low-risk lending – which has forced down the interest rates that they charge to generate profits.

The warning comes after banks and building societies launched some of the cheapest mortgage deals on record.

Halifax will tomorrow launch one of the cheapest two-year deals ever at 0.83 per cent for borrowers with a 40 per cent deposit.

Last month, Nationwide offered a five-year deal with a rate of 0.99 per cent.

Ray Boulger, a mortgage expert at broker John Charcol, said this was the 'first time the UK has seen a deal on five-year, fixed-rate mortgages below 1 per cent'.

Rival lenders including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, NatWest and TSB have followed suit. One bank chairman told The Mail on Sunday: 'Ringfencing is fuelling house prices because mortgages are so cheap.

'It's another regulatory intervention that is driving cheap money, and this is making it even tougher for first time buyers to get on the ladder.'

The mortgage price war has already forced Sainsbury's Bank and Tesco Bank out of the market.

Senior analysts at Goldman Sachs have reduced their share price forecasts for Lloyds, NatWest, Barclays and Virgin Money 'to reflect headwinds in UK mortgage pricing'.

Banks have seen £370billion of customer deposits flood in since the start of 2020, while lending has grown by just £100billion, which Goldman said has left a huge pool of savings dormant in the banks.

Mortgages account for most of the £100billion figure.

Goldman said: 'This has resulted in a substantial increase in excess deposits trapped in the ring-fences of major banks.'

The analysts said: 'This in our view is the key reason for mortgage pricing having fallen. The decline in pricing occurred faster than we expected.'

Andy Golding, chief executive of OneSavings Bank, a specialist mortgage lender, said: 'I think in the high street banking market it's definitely having a downward impact on mortgage pricing.

'The big high street banks have got to do something with all the ringfenced cash they're sitting on – and so they're pumping it into residential mortgages at exceptionally low rates.

'If that becomes the norm, the high street market will become absolutely dominated by the high street banks, meaning the smaller building societies won't be able to compete at all.'

The fresh warning will fuel the debate over whether the ring-fencing rules are fit for purpose.

The Treasury has kicked off a review led by Keith Skeoch, the former boss of Standard Life Aberdeen, who will report the findings to Chancellor Rishi Sunak early next year.

The Mail on Sunday revealed last month that former Barclays boss Bob Diamond was lobbying for the end to ring-fencing rules.

It is understood that he hopes to unlock deals in the banking sector for his investment firm Atlas Merchant Capital. But some banking experts believe the ring-fencing rules are not solely to blame.

A source close to HSBC said the bank retreated from the mortgage market after it was burned by subprime mortgages during the financial crisis.

He said: 'The big strategic shift was when HSBC went back into the broker market in 2015, before ringfencing even came into force.'

Mortgage brokers account for the lion's share of the market, with only a small percentage of loans being dished out directly by the banks.

HSBC's share of the mortgage market has nearly doubled to 10 per cent since 2015.

The biggest high street banks have said over the past few weeks that demand for cheap mortgages has been so high that they are struggling to keep up – even as the stamp duty holiday started to taper off at the end of June.

William Chalmers, chief financial officer of Lloyds Banking Group, the biggest mortgage lender, said the market is getting 'more competitive'. He added the bank will keep an eye on mortgage lending to protect profits.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Thousands more bereaved families are set to be given vital financial support thanks to a change in the Government's eligibility rules.

When someone passes away, their family is often entitled to bereavement support payments to help in those difficult first few months.

Under the current system, the money is paid only to families where the deceased was married or in a civil partnership.

However, eligibility will be extended next year to include non-married cohabiting couples following a Supreme Court ruling.

Support: Laura with her late partner Nigel and their son Noah, a year before the proud dad passed away

More than 22,000 additional families will then be able to claim this help, totalling £320million over the next five years.

What support is available – and how to claim it

Surviving spouses can claim bereavement support payments of up to £9,800 across 18 months following their partner's death.

That can be a lifeline for families hit with a loss of a partner or parent. They are likely to face a drop in household income, additional childcare costs and funeral bills.

To be eligible, the bereaved must have been under State pension age when their partner died.

The partner must have paid National Insurance contributions for at least 25 weeks in one tax year since 1975 or died because of an accident at work or a disease caused by work.

Bereaved spouses receive £2,500 plus £100 monthly for 18 months, or if they are entitled to child benefit, they receive £3,500 plus £350 for 18 months.

At the moment, payments are still made only to families where the couple were married or in a civil partnership.

However, with next year's changes, back payments will be made as lump sums back to August 30, 2018.

The bereavement support payments, introduced in 2017, replaced the more generous widowed parent's allowance, which had been in place since 2001.

Under the previous scheme, young families who lost a parent could claim support until the children turned 18. Some families are still receiving these payments.

To claim support, you can contact the Bereavement Service Helpline on 0800 731 0469.

IT WILL MAKE SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE Laura Rudd's world came crashing down in March last year, when her partner Nigel died suddenly aged 50 while out on a jog. The couple had been together for nine years and had a son, Noah, now four. But because they were not married, Laura was denied financial support. The Government's changes will mean Laura, 35, should receive backdated bereavement support payments of just under £10,000. However, it could still be months until she receives the money. 'The difference that money could make to me as a lone parent is phenomenal,' says Laura. 'When you lose your partner, although it may feel like it, the world does not end – there are still bills to pay. 'Suddenly you are responsible for everything – the mortgage, council tax, keeping a roof over your heads. A basic funeral also costs around £3,500.' Laura, who is a psychology teacher from Wilberfoss, near York, adds: 'I've spoken to people who not only lose their partner, they also lose their home. 'I see the damage that does to families, and how physical and mental health can suffer. I'm looking forward to using the support payments to look after my son's future.'

Why the Government is making changes now

In 2018, a mother of four won a major court case on bereavement benefits, forcing a Government rethink. Siobhan McLaughlin had been living with her partner John Adams for 23 years when he died in 2014. They had four children together.

McLaughlin, from County Antrim, was denied the widowed parent's allowance because they were not married.

She successfully challenged the decision in the Supreme Court, which ruled that denying her the allowance was incompatible with human rights legislation.

In 2020, the High Court also ruled that denying the new-style bereavement support payment to two bereaved unmarried fathers and their children was similarly incompatible.

The Government finally announced in July that it was amending legislation to change the eligibility criteria. However, the amendments need to be approved by Parliament, which could take months. There is still some uncertainty about who will receive the full entitlement.

Charity WAY Widowed and Young is calling on the Government to ensure retrospective payments are made to all those who would have been eligible had they been married, whether under the newer bereavement support payments system or the previous widowed parent's allowance.

Georgia Elms, ambassador for the charity, adds: 'It is regrettable that it has taken so long for the Government to respond to the court judgments and that thousands of bereaved parents and their children have lost out on the financial support they so vitally needed during that time.'

Why the support is essential for families

Bereavement support payments are paid for from the National Insurance contributions of the person who has passed away. The deceased may have paid tens of thousands of pounds in contributions towards a State pension they will never be alive to claim.

Instead, some of that money is given to their children or partner when they need it most.

The payments help widows bringing up children with a sudden drop in family income, or help families to find the money needed for immediate costs after a loved one passes away.

Widows or widowers bringing up young children may also want to take some time out of work to look after their youngsters, or may not feel strong enough to get straight back to work. Those who do are likely to face higher childcare costs.

Do unmarried couples have the same rights?

Almost half of people in England and Wales mistakenly believe that unmarried couples who live together have a common law marriage and enjoy the same rights as couples who are legally married, according to the National Centre for Social Research.

In reality, common law marriage is a status the law does not recognise. However, the Supreme Court ruled that a child should not be treated differently because of the marital status of its parents – a situation over which a child has no control.

British car manufacturer Morgan has unveiled its latest model that will allow sports car fanatics to tackle the harshest landscapes - granted they can afford one of the eight examples being built.

The Plus Four CX-T is like no other road-legal Morgan seen before. With off-road tyres, hardcore suspension and a protective exoskeleton, it's be co-created with Rally Raid UK - renowned for building race cars to take on the Dakar Rally - to deal with the toughest terrains a driver could throw at it.

And it won't come cheap. The limited run of eight cars will cost a whopping £204,000 each.

Morgan's mad new off-roader: This is the iconic British brand's new retro model - a hardcore rally raid machine designed to take on the toughest terrains imaginable

Morgan says its new Plus Four CX-T is 'a car with adventure at its core' and one with 'capability not yet witnessed on a Morgan sports car'.

While it is like nothing we've seen in a Morgan sales brochure before, it does hark back to Morgan's history of competing in all-terrain endurance trials going back more than a century.

As early as 1911, Morgan sports cars were competing and winning in off-road competitions.

Called the CX-T, it is a modified version of the Morgan Plus Four that's had a full make over to ensure it can tackle the harshest routes

Just 8 examples of the Plus Four CX-T are going to be built by the Worcestershire car maker, each with a staggering purchase price

Before taxes, each example will cost £170,000. Add VAT for UK customers and that sends the price to £204,000 - easily stepping into Ferrari and Lamborghini supercar territory

According to the Worcestershire specialist car maker, its 'more adventurous' customers have been calling for a modern-era version to take away from the tarmac for years.

Prices will start from £170,000, though with the addition of VAT in the UK means the total outlay is £204,000 - that's easily stepping into Ferrari, Lamborghini and McLaren supercar territory and around four times the price of a standard Morgan Plus Four.

Buyers of the eight cars will be invited to the brand's factory in Malvern to specify their own CX-T. Once built, it be sent to Rally Raid UK's workshop in Huddersfield for final preparation and setup before being unleashed on rock-riddled routes.

Morgan says its new Plus Four CX-T is 'a car with adventure at its core' and one with 'capability not yet witnessed on a Morgan sports car'

If you want one of the 8 cars being built, you can order it now. Morgan says all examples will be produced and ready to deliver before the end of the year

'The project was unrestrained and born entirely from a desire to create an exciting British adventure vehicle,' says head of design, Jonathan Wells

The Plus Four CX-T is on sale now, with all eight vehicles due to be built before the end of 2021.

Jonathan Wells, head of design, Morgan Motor Company, said: 'The Morgan design team has been conceptualising modern day trialling vehicles for many years. Around 18 months ago, our investors and CEO, Steve Morris, were in the studio and remarked how incredible it would be to bring one of these drawings to life.

'The project was unrestrained and born entirely from a desire to create an exciting British adventure vehicle.

'The CX-T, like many recent Morgan vehicles, demonstrates the flexibility of the Morgan design. For me, it’s a complete package: historical integrity, legitimate capability, and a brand-new adventure-lead aesthetic.'

Even when driving off-road, the CX-T should be good for a 0-62mph sprint in around 5 seconds

The total power output is 255bhp and it will be sold with the choice of either a six-speed manual gearbox or an eight-speed ZF auto - both BMW compontents

The design team says its bonkers off-road version of the sports car has been designed to maximise luggage and equipment carrying capacity, and provide the occupant protection necessary for extreme environments

Powering the car is the same 2.0-litre, single-turbo, four-cylinder BMW powerplant that already features in the conventional Plus Four sports car

Retro Morgan looks but wrapped in a bonkers protective exoskeleton

Under the side-hinged bonnet is the same 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged BMW engine used in the conventional Plus Four.

It produces a 255bhp, which should be enough to launch it to 62mph in under 5 seconds, though slightly longer if customers opt for a six-speed manual gearbox rather than an eight-speed ZF auto, which is also taken from the German marque.

But it's there that the similarities seemingly end.

The design team says its bonkers off-road version of the sports car has been designed to maximise luggage and equipment carrying capacity, and provide the occupant protection necessary for extreme environments.

Your eye is first drawn to the exoskeleton roll cage that wraps around the cabin area and consists of an equipment rack at the rear of the vehicle.

Morgan has ensured the driver is fully protected with an exoskeletal roll cage that wraps around the classically-style panels

The Plus Four CX-T's rack is there to provide all the necessary kit for a weekend of dune driving or serious off-roading

The rear deck holds two 'ruggedised' and waterproof luggage cases, an aluminium storage box for tools, two 11-litre fuel containers and a pair of spare wheels and a jack. The external frame also holds the rear brake lights

The underside of the car has also been fully protected, in case enthusiast owners clip a rock or boulder on their rally excursions

Underneath the crash protection are unique body panels designed to fit the external scaffolding but still retain the iconic classic four-seater Morgan look.

If a driver does get unstuck off the beaten track, the car has winch points mounted on the exterior of the car within easy reach, just in case you need the support of a Land Rover or similar 4X4 to pull you out of a tight spot.

The protective exoskeleton can also be adapted to carry leisure equipment such as bikes and surf boards, to compliment the lifestyle activities of the owner, while the removable side screens can be mounted onto the roof of the vehicle, allowing them to be carried in case of a change in weather conditions.

At the front, the crash bars can also house four high-powered spotlights for those late evenings blasting across deserts and other challenging landscapes and a rally-inspired number board for the authentic off-road look.

Hardcore suspension means it can take on the toughest endurance rally events

To ensure it can cope with the harshest of terrains, Rally Raid UK undertook a durability assessments of the platform, drivetrain, and suspension systems of the standard Plus Four before recommending the adaptation that will turn it into an off-road weapon.

The suspension has been designed to be 'expedition ready'.

It features a ground clearance of 230mm - enough to scale a rock or two - and required a widened track (the distance across the width of the vehicle) so that adequate suspension components can be fitted.

While it uses existing Morgan wishbones, it has longer suspension arms, bespoke bushes and competition-ready coilovers and bumpstops.

The design team has even had to modify the wheel arches to make them deeper so the long-travel suspension can compress into the wheel well.

'The combined suspension package is optimised to undertake journeys never before attempted in a Morgan sports car, while ensuring composure and comfort during any excursion into the back country,' according to the UK firm.

Huge Group B rally-like mudflaps should prevent following vehicles being pebble-dashed when the driver floors the throttle

Protecting the underside of the vehicle is a five-piece underbody protection system – comprising an engine guard, rear chassis guard, mid-section shield and rear undertray. An entirely new exhaust system has been developed with side-exit.

These adaptations help to protect the chassis and important components from damage when driving in extreme conditions.

Other additions include a BMW X-Drive electronic differential to modulate the power to the rear wheels, with three driving modes - Road, All-Terrain and All-Terrain Extreme.

The latter fully locks the rear differential, providing equal torque to both rear wheels.

At all four corners - and the two spares - are lightweight allow wheels wrapped in performance off-road rubber that should help put all 255 horses down even on loose surfaces. Huge Group-B-like mudflaps should prevent following vehicles being pebble-dashed when the driver floors the throttle.

The CX-T features a ground clearance of 230mm - enough to scale a rock or two - and required a widened track (the distance across the width of the vehicle) so that adequate suspension components can be fitted

Inside, the cabin of the Plus Four CX-T has been redesigned so it doesn't rattle to pieces when being driven in remote environments

It has a sliding track mounted into to the dashboard (seen here holding a mobile phone) to allow the secure fixing of a variety of devices. There's also a flexible map light, pencil and notebook holder, just in case customers want to get the full rally raid experience

The side door panels are also fully detachable and there is fitments on the exoskeleton to carry them on the roof

It has a sliding track mounted into to the dashboard to allow the secure fixing of a variety of devices such as phones or cameras. There's also a flexible map light, pencil and notebook holder, just in case customers want to get the full rally raid experience.

Cabin stowage has also been optimised with the addition of a removable map holder and insulated cool bag, both located in the passenger footwell.

A custom-made first aid kit is mounted to the internal roll cage behind the seats.

While it is like nothing we've seen in a Morgan sales brochure before, it does hark back to Morgan's history of competing in all-terrain endurance trials going back more than a century

As early as 1911, Morgan sports cars were competing and winning in off-road competitions

Lightweight, powerful and featuring capable suspension, Morgans were seen as the ideal weapon to take on tough rally routes

While Morgan has never produced an off-road focussed model to sell to customers, it says there has been huge demand for a car of this type from enthusiasts and collectors

Just like the exterior equipment, every interior feature has been designed with accessibility and convenience in mind, whether this is for use in remote conditions or a driver is circumnavigating the M25.

The cabin is enclosed within a one-off composite hard top unique to the Plus Four CX-T, which is intricately engineered to fit between the internal and external roll cages.

Commenting on the modifications made to the Morgan, Mike Jones from Rally Raid UK, said: 'Applying my experience of 13 Dakar Rallies, 60 Dakar vehicle builds and a lifetime of overland adventuring to an unconventional sports car such as a Morgan has been an interesting and rewarding project.

'Having the opportunity to design a car for such a prestigious marque has been a responsibility that I never imagined I would have.

'Rally Raid UK and Morgan have engaged with industry-leading suppliers to source the highest quality components, as well as designing a range of bespoke parts that will remain unique to the model.

'The Morgan Plus Four CX-T is a genuine overland adventure vehicle and I look forward to seeing the incredible destinations that owners will find themselves in.'

Additional luggage space comes in the form of external satchels that strap onto the external crash bars

Customers will be able to visit the Malvern factory to specify the exact details of the cars they order. Each of the 8 models will be signed off by Rally Raid UK, which has partnered with Morgan on the project. It is based on Huddersfield, making this a UK developed and built car
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@People saving for later life are missing out on 'better retirements' because institutional investors focus too heavily on the returns from stock market listed companies, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have warned.

In an open letter, Johnson and Sunak called on pension funds and other major investors to back entrepreneurial British companies that need money to grow.

Pension funds hold billions of pounds for their members, but 80 per cent of their money is in listed securities, namely shares traded on the London Stock Exchange.

Yet, listed securities only make up 20 per cent of UK assets, Johnson and Sunak said.

Open letter: Sunak and Johnson have written an open letter to Britain's institutional investors

The duo have asked big institutional investors to consider long-term investments in UK assets to help the economy rebound following the pandemic.

They cited Canadian and Australian pension funds as examples of how to move forward.

The aim is to ignite an investment 'big bang' that could potentially unlock the hundreds of billions of pounds sitting in UK institutions.

Johnson and Sunak said in the letter: 'We recognise the responsibility of the Government to remove obstacles and costs to making long-term, illiquid investments in the UK.

'The Government is doing everything possible – short of mandating more investment in these areas as some have advocated – to encourage a change in mindset and behaviour among institutional investors, and we remain open to addressing further barriers where they are identified.

'UK institutional investors are under-represented in owning UK assets.

'We are challenging you this summer to begin to invest more in long-term UK assets, giving pension savers access to better returns and enabling them to see their funds support an innovative, healthier, greener future for their country.

'We know that this will require a change in mindset for many investors that won't happen overnight, but that is why this change needs to start now.'

Investors can make high returns on their money by putting cash into start-up companies and other innovators in the economy that are not listed on a public exchange.

Missing out: Britons' retirements are suffering due to pension funds focusing too much on stock market listed firms, Johnson and Sunak warned

But, these type of investments can often be difficult to sell on.

Back in 2019, the Woodford Equity Income Fund, run by fund manager Neil Woodford, had to be suspended after Mr Woodford invested too much of the fund's money in illiquid assets.

Woodford allowed his clients to take their cash out of the fund whenever they wanted, but he was unable to honour this largely because much of the money was tied up in these hard-to-sell assets.

However, pension funds do not allow their members to withdraw cash at any time, which provides more protection against the kind of surge in withdrawals which troubled the Woodford fund.

Johnson and Sunak said that ministers would explain more about their plans in the coming weeks.

They added: 'We need an investment big bang, to unlock the hundreds of billions of pounds sitting in UK institutional investors and use it to drive the UK's recovery.'

But, John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant, said: 'This is 90 per cent hot air from the Prime Minister.

'Defined benefit pension schemes need assets that generate a guaranteed inflation linked return to pay guaranteed pensions. Most of the things the PM is banging the drum for don't do this.

'For defined contribution auto-enrolment pensions investments should be as transparent as possible and as cheap as possible. Again, most of the things being pushed here don't do this.'

The Daily Mail's City Editor, Alex Brummer, believes Johnson and Sunak need to go further to help push British businesses forward.

He said: 'They could have told the so-called UK long funds that instead of capitulating at the first sound of gunfire from private equity and other predators – as is the case at Morrisons, aerospace innovators Meggitt et al – they should tell financially driven bidders to get lost.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I have three private pension policies with a provider that amount to around £55,000.

Recently I contacted the pension provider to advise that I would like to buy a fixed term (four-year) annuity from them, but I was advised that they did not offer fixed term annuities, and that I would therefore need to transfer my pension to a different pension provider and obtain quotes from those pension providers which do offer fixed term annuities.

Through a comparison site I was provided with the names of three pension providers which offered fixed term annuities.

Retirement planning: I'm trying to buy an annuity with a £55k pot, and was gobsmacked to find my broker gets a £1,155 commission (Stock image)

Shortly after using the site, I was contacted by a broker and of the three pension providers found the best quote for a fixed term annuity among them.

At around the same time, I also phoned that provider directly in order to request a similar quote, in case I could obtain a more favourable one by going directly through them rather than through the broker.

However, I was advised by the provider that in order to obtain a quote for a fixed term annuity directly through them I would first need to arrange an appointment (I think a telephone appointment was suggested), during which their financial/pension adviser would then go through my options with me and offer me advice.

At the time, I neglected to ask the price of this - the mere mention of a financial/pension adviser set alarm bells ringing in my head, because of the perceived cost involved - because, at that time I believed that this route might in the end prove to be more expensive than dealing directly through the broker.

Shortly afterwards I then instructed the broker to proceed with my request to transfer my pension from my current provider to the provider I had contacted and to buy a fixed term (four-year) annuity with equal monthly payments (with a 25 per cent tax-free lump-sum at the beginning).

The necessary documents were then sent to me by the broker in the mail, and after reading through them, I noticed a section (Adviser Charge/Commission) where it stated that this was not an advised sale and that the commission rate was 2.1 per cent.

I was gobsmacked. That equated to £1,155.

What I would like to know is if this is normal/fair/average in terms of a commission charged in such circumstances, or should I be shopping around to seek quotes from other organisations in case they charge less commission?

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK STEVE YOUR PENSION QUESTION

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

Steve Webb replies: Your experiences show the importance of reading the 'small print' before you take out any financial product and also raises an interesting question about why you are paying 'commission' when you didn't receive financial advice.

Let's consider first the process of saving in a pension and using it to buy a regular income – an 'annuity'.

The first vital point of is that even though you have saved with one company - Company A - you don't have to buy your annuity from Company A.

You have a right to exercise something known in the jargon as your 'Open Market Option'.

This simply means you can take your pot and buy an annuity from someone else.

Likewise, if you decide instead to go into drawdown, you don't have to take the offering from Company A. You can – and should – shop around.

I have no doubt that savers continue to lose millions of pounds each year because they stick with the easy option – Company A – rather than seeing what else is on offer.

In your case you were buying a rather specialist product – an annuity that didn't last your whole life but just for a fixed term of four years.

Your provider did not offer this product so you did some research and identified a company – Company B – who would offer this product.

You transferred your pension pot to Company B but were then surprised to see a relatively large commission fee would be charged when you bought your annuity.

The rules around commission on pensions have changed in recent years and are now in a rather strange place.

In the past you could go to a financial adviser and they would often offer you 'free' advice.

The adviser could afford to do this because they were going to get a commission from the pension company.

But the problem with that system was that they might be tempted to choose the company which offered the best commission for them, rather than the best pension for you.

As a result, commission for advisers was banned in 2012 and you now pay for financial advice directly instead.

What this means is that if you had gone to a financial adviser for regulated financial advice on your annuity purchase there would have been no commission, though you would have had to meet the cost of the advice.

Even so, you might have got a better deal over all.

What happened in your case was that although you used an annuity broker – a bit like an upmarket comparison site – they did not actually give you advice.

This means that there is still a 'commission' linked to the annuity and this goes to the annuity broker.

The good news is that you didn't just sign on the dotted line.

Now that you are aware of how the system works, you could ask the annuity broker to 'rebate' some of the commission back to you, or you could shop around and see if another annuity broker will offer better terms.

You could also compare this with the rate you would get if you used a financial adviser and paid for advice.

As you will see, this is far from straightforward. Indeed, to make sure I understood exactly what was going on I consulted annuities expert Billy Burrows of Better Retirement.

Whilst neither Billy nor I can give you financial advice, on hearing the outline of your experience Billy noted that a four-year fixed term annuity option may not be as simple as it seems and that there might be alternatives which would better meet your needs.

Again, this might mean that taking advice gave you better value over all than simply using a broker and paying commission.

In summary, probably the worst thing anyone can do is 'sleepwalk' from saving into a pension with Company A and then buying an annuity (or drawdown product) from Company A without seeing what else is on offer.

And in the case of annuities, you should also compare the deal you would get if you pay for advice and pay no commission with an unadvised purchase with commission.

And if you go for the latter option you should again shop around to see if you can get some of the commission back from your annuity broker.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gold was trading at just over $1,500 (£1,100) a troy ounce in January 2020. Six months later, the price had risen to $1,800 an ounce and today it is flirting with $1,900 as investors look to gold as a bulwark against economic uncertainty and rising inflation.

Capital Ltd is a prime beneficiary of optimism about the precious metal. Offering a range of mining services to gold producers, the company recently reported its best ever first quarter. The second quarter, to June 30, is likely to be even better.

Demand is at record levels and brokers expect full-year sales to rise more than 40 per cent to $192million, with underlying profits equally well ahead at around $50million.

Glowing: Midas recommended Capital in May 2020 when the price was 61p - the shares have since risen 34 per cent

Midas recommended Capital in May 2020 when the price was 61p. The shares have since risen 34 per cent to 82p and should deliver further growth.

Capital specialises in helping mining giants such as Barrick Gold and Anglo Gold Ashanti to drill. The business has moved into related areas too, including earthmoving and geological analysis.

Earthmoving is big business and Capital won its biggest ever deal last December, a $250million four-year contract from London-listed Centamin.

Midas verdict: Mining is a cyclical business but chairman Jamie Boyton has worked hard to shield Capital from the inevitable ups and downs. Contracts are long term and there is good growth potential across the business, especially as Capital considers moving into other commodities besides gold. At 82p, the shares should continue to deliver gains.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I'm a leaseholder living in a purpose-built apartment, and the service charge I pay rises by about 10 per cent each year.

Some of the costs I am being billed for seem inflated. For example, I noticed that the buildings insurance, which is included as part of the service charge, increased by over 25 per cent in our latest annual bill, which does not make any sense.

The management company's excuses are nothing but jargon. It blames the rising costs on Covid-19, and 'key fundamentals'.

Asked about the insurance, it said 'several factors have significantly contributed to the increase charged by the insurance market' - but it won't disclose what these are.

To add insult to injury, myself and my fellow resident leaseholders feel totally neglected. It sometimes takes months for simple issues to be fixed.

For example, it took them over one year to fix the lift. Of course Covid-19 was once again to blame. I'm also absolutely certain the apartment windows have not been cleaned in all the eight years I have lived here - they are absolutely filthy.

What can we the leaseholders do to take back control? Is there a way to challenge the escalating costs? And is there a way can we change our managing agent? Via email

Government figures estimate there to be around 4.5 million leasehold homes in England alone, of which 69 per cent are flats and 31 per cent are houses

Ed Magnus of This is Money replies: I'm sorry to hear of your troubles with your managing agent, and of the spiralling costs you are being subjected to.

Leaseholders can sometimes feel powerless when it comes to the management and upkeep of the buildings they live in.

More than a quarter of leaseholders have complained about the high cost of works and management fees, according to a survey by the HomeOwners Alliance.

Unlike freeholders, leaseholders do not own the land their properties are built on. Instead, they rent it on a lease which lasts a number of years - usually at least 99.

Whilst maintaining the flat itself is typically the leaseholder's responsibility, the building itself and any communal areas often fall on the freeholder, who will in turn often appoint a managing agent to do so on their behalf.

Most leaseholders, particularly those in purpose-built apartment blocks, will have a service charge to pay, which goes towards the upkeep of the building and any communal areas.

The lease should always set out the way the service charge is organised and what fees can be charged.

It often includes the costs of buildings insurance, cleaning, gardening, repairs of communal areas, surveyors fees, fire risk assessments and managing agents fees, among others.

One in five leaseholders objected to unfair service charges and 23 per cent reported they had a lack of control over which major works are done, according to the HomeOwners Alliance

If you pay a service charge, you have the right to ask for a summary showing how the charge is worked out and what it's spent on, as well as any paperwork supporting the summary, such as receipts.

The freeholder or managing agent must give the leaseholder this information, and it's a criminal offence if they don't.

The managing agent will usually be responsible for insuring the building - not including the contents - and this will often be part of your service charge, although it is sometimes kept separate.

You may be able to apply to a tribunal if you pay a service charge and you think it's unreasonable or that work is poorly done.

However, be aware that the freeholder or management company can also take you to court if you stop paying the service charge.

When it comes to the neglect you feel you and your fellow leaseholders are enduring, you may be able to change the management of your building if you're unhappy with the way it's being run.

To do this, you can either ask a tribunal to appoint a new manager, or take over the management responsibilities, known as your 'right to manage.'

The freeholder can also apply to the tribunal to challenge your notice to set up a 'right to manage' company.

For example, the building may not eligible for the right to manage, because more than 25 per cent is non-residential, or less than two-thirds of the flats are owned by qualifying leaseholders.

But if there are many leaseholders in the building, managing it yourselves may prove impractical and you may be better off appointing a new managing agent.

To appoint a new manager, you must prove bad management.

Demonstrating that you have to pay unreasonable service charges or that the landlord has not complied with an approved code of management practice might be sufficient.

We spoke to Kevin Lever, a partner at KDL Law, and Dona Awano, a member of the Law Society's conveyancing and land law committee, to help answer your questions.

Is a yearly 10 per cent rise in service charge normal?

Kevin Lever replies: Service charges will tend to increase year-on-year like most expenses in life.

Whether 10 per cent is reasonable or unreasonable will depend on numerous specific issues.

What about the 25 per cent jump in the building's insurance premium?

Kevin Lever replies: The property management experts that we talk to are saying that insurance premiums have been increasing over the past two years, and rises of this nature are not uncommon.

The 25 per cent increase on the block in question is likely being driven by a number of major factors.

First, insurers are considering the greater risks highlighted by the Grenfell fire and cladding, as well as other fire protection measures now required.

Second, the cost of claims has increased during the pandemic as there has been a significant rise in the cost of building materials thanks to supply shortages, not helped by the increased demand over the last 18 months as more people have renovated their homes.

Third, there have been more claims made during the pandemic, presumably because more people were at home for more of the time over the last 18 months and thus more mishaps occurred in the home.

What about challenging the managing agent?

Kevin Lever replies: The level of service a landlord or managing agent must provide is dependent upon the provisions in the lease.

Leases will often require that a landlord must clean the flat windows, but some don't, so it's always worth checking the lease.

Poor service by the managing agent is an issue that should be taken up politely with the agent in the first instance.

All residential property managing agents are required to provide you with details of the consumer redress scheme of which they are members, and to have a formal complaints process for you to follow.

Leasehold let-down: Hefty service charges and unsatisfactory explanations for cost increases are causing a headache for this homeowner

If your complaint to the managing agent does not provide a satisfactory outcome, then you should refer the matter to the relevant redress scheme. They will make a ruling on your complaint and may award compensation if appropriate.

It would be wise to seek advice before raising your complaint, as whilst the agent is the face of the landlord and may be responsible for any poor service, your complaint might in fact be about matters to be addressed to the landlord and thus beyond the scope of the redress scheme.

In this case, you may need to make an application to the First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber).

It will assess whether the service charge is reasonable and judge whether the landlord has failed to fulfil their obligations under the lease.

If we ask a tribunal to appoint a new manager, what evidence is required?

Dona Awano replies: The appointment of a manager is a fault-based remedy, so the leaseholders must be able to prove that the landlord, or their managing agent, are in breach of their repair or maintenance obligations under the lease.

Advice from the HomeOwners Alliance By chief executive Paula Higgins When it comes to insurance, managing agents should shop around for at least 3 quotes. Managing agents sometimes receive a referral fee with a particular insurer, so we would suggest you ask the agent directly whether they receive a referral fee and what it is. It is worth looking into getting the right to manage - the process is straightforward, but you do need to get 50 per cent of the leaseholders on board. Make sure you instruct a leasehold specialist lawyer who is a member of the Association of Leasehold Enfranchisement Practicioners. The other option is to ask your freeholder to sell you the freehold, and you might even be eligible to demand that they sell it to you.

Alternatively, you need to show that the managing agent is charging excessive service charges or administration charges, or that they have failed to comply with an approved code of good practice.

The leaseholder will also need to shop around to find a professional managing agent who is willing to take on the management of the building, and who they can nominate to the tribunal.

If an order appointing a manager is made, it's only for a limited period of time - though there is an option to make a further appointment to extend the order if necessary.

Is the 'right to manage' a credible option?

Dona Awano replies: There are a number of requirements for both the building and the leaseholders which have to be satisfied.

For example, at least 50 per cent of the flats in the building must participate in the process.

No fault needs to be proved prior to exercising the right, but the landlord still remains the freeholder of the building - they would just no longer have the right to maintain the building or to demand and collect service charges.

An alternative is to buy the freehold collectively, with each leaseholder owning a share.

With this, the qualifying requirements are the same as for the right to manage.

Are there any regulatory changes afoot that will help leaseholders in the future?

Dona Awano replies: In 2019, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government published recommendations on how property agents, estate agents and letting agents are managed, with the aim being to regulate them - although there is no legislation on this issue yet.

We understand that the Law Commission, the MHCLG and the Regulation of Property Agents working group are trying to improve the situation for future leaseholders, but it won't solve the immediate problem.

We also understand that the Law Commission is preparing legislation to come to parliament which will make it quicker and cheaper to buy the freehold of blocks, so these service charge issues don't arise.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's biggest accountancy firm PwC has seen its profits surge over the past year thanks to the boom in deals.

Partners will receive an average payment of £818,000 for the year to the end of June, plus a sum of around £50,000 relating to one-off items, including the sale of its tech platform.

That was up from £685,000 in 2021 and a pre-Covid £765,000 in 2019. Profit for the financial year rose 25 per cent, to £1.17billion.

Partners at PWC will receive an average payment of £818,000 for the year to the end of June, plus a sum of around £50,000 relating to one-off items, including the sale of its tech platform

Just under 940 of PwC's 22,000 staff in the UK have achieved the coveted status of partner. Their individual rewards vary widely according to their seniority, performance and how much business they bring in.

The firm, led by senior partner and chairman Kevin Ellis, also paid out more in rewards to other staff. Its UK bonus pot was increased to a record £128million, from £113million before the virus struck, plus an extra week's pay in May.

PwC continued to hire throughout the pandemic and the lockdowns, taking on 3,300 new joiners.

The performance was fuelled by strong growth in deals revenue, which rose by 9 per cent to £854million.

The UK has seen record takeovers and mergers so far this year, leading to rising demand for professional services and advice.

'It is a deals-led recovery,' said Ellis. 'The deal level is mind-blowing.'

Buoyant demand for professional services is likely to continue, driven by deal-making. Firms are also seeking advice as they move faster towards digitisation due to the pandemic and as they try to address climate change.

Many are recalibrating their business models as 'just-in-time' supply chains, based on low-cost international sourcing, have come under strain because of Covid.

'Like our clients, we see the pandemic recovery as a catalyst of profound change, driving increased demand for our deals, financing, digitisation, ESG and supply chain transformation services,' said Ellis.

He added that the UK needs to embark on a 'massive retraining exercise' involving government, the education sector and businesses, to ensure workers have the skills they need for the economy of the future.

Ellis last month sparked a national debate on working from home after he told the Daily Mail being away from the office too much will blight the careers of young professionals as they will miss out on camaraderie and the opportunity to learn from their seniors.

Rishi Sunak weighed in by saying he doubted he would have done so well if he had begun is working life from home, using Teams or Zoom.

The Chancellor added that it is 'valuable' for young people in particular to be physically in the office.

The London-listed company, which is based in Prague, revealed it was in merger talks last month.

A deal has now been done with Norton, which intends to pay with cash and shares. The merger will create a cyber security giant with annual revenues of £2.5billion and more than 500m customers.

Tech merger: Avast has been sold to American rival Norton in a £6.2bn deal which will create a cyber security giant with annual revenues of £2.5bn and more than 500m customers

Vincent Pilette, chief executive of Norton, said his company was strong in identity theft protection whereas Avast was strong in privacy. He added: 'We both have the vision of a common platform.'

Avast shares rose 3.1 per cent, or 17.6p, to 586p. Founded in the Czech Republic, its 'freemium' software, offers basic services for free, and sophisticated ones for a price.

It had 435m active users at the end of 2020, of whom 16.5m were paying. Norton, previously known as Symantec, has a larger premium business which sells software to combat viruses, spyware, malware and other attacks.

After the merger, likely to complete in 12 months, Avast shareholders are expected to hold 14 to 26 per cent of the company.

This will depend on whether they choose to be paid in cash or shares.

The companies plan to slash shared costs, notably by cutting staff from 5,000 to 4,000, and will also aim to wring out £202million of other savings. There will be two HQs – in Prague and, Arizona.

Analysts at Jefferies said the deal 'looks strategically sensible… but investors are unlikely to feel the offer is particularly generous'.

Shareholders who choose to be paid mainly in cash will see their Avast shares valued at about 608.4p.

Those who choose mostly Norton stock will see their Avast shares valued at about 551p.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It rarely pays to be loyal these days when it comes to the interest on your savings, but Coventry Building Society appears to be bucking that trend.

The UK's second largest building society has launched the Loyalty 21 Day Notice Saver paying 0.65 per cent.

And while that rate is hardly one to blow away savers, it does beat the lowly average-paying account and most rivals.

The account will only be open to customers who have been with Coventry since 1 January 2020 and comes with a few catches.

The new savings account will be available to members who have been with Coventry Building Society continuously starting on or before 1 January 2020.

The main limitation is that savers will only be able to save up to £20,000 in the account, or £40,000 for joint accounts and can access their savings as many times as they want with 21 days' notice, or immediately subject to 21 days' interest penalty.

James Blower, founder of The Savings Guru said: 'It is a really good offer from Coventry and it is great to see a provider rewarding loyalty rather than the best offers being for new customers only.

'However, Coventry look after £39.1 billion of deposits in a market of £1.7 trillion and, given the fact it is only for existing members and has a £20,000 per person limit, it's only going to be of interest to a few Coventry members and that's not significant enough to impact the wider savings market.'

How does it compare to other deals?

Someone stashing away the maximum £20,000 in Coventry's Loyalty 21 Day Notice Saver over the course of a year would earn £130 in interest.

That's much better than what a saver would earn in the average easy access account paying 0.18 per cent, according to Moneyfacts – just £36 interest from a £20,000 lump sum after one year.

Notice accounts, such as Coventry's, offer savers a higher return with the average notice account paying 0.45 per cent interest, according to Moneyfacts.

However, notice periods typically range between 30 and 90 days, meaning Coventry's 21-day notice period is less than usual.

The best paying account with a 30-day notice period is Secure Trust Bank paying 0.55 per cent, according to Moneyfacts.

However, Investec Bank is currently offering a rate of 0.7 per cent for a 32-day notice account.

Savers who apply for that via the savings platform, Raisin can also qualify for a welcome bonus payment of up to £50 depending on how much they put in.

In terms of the highest rates on offer, Hampshire Trust Bank is currently offering a rate of 0.85 per cent, but savers will need to give a much longer 95 days' notice to withdraw funds.

Although Coventry's rate is competitive it is by no means the best notice deal around: it's advantage, however, is that the notice period required to withdraw funds is only three weeks, which will give savers some peace of mind that their cash will be relatively accessible were they to suddenly need it.

Despite this, its notice period may still be an issue for those who prefer an immediate and penalty free access to their savings - particularly given that the best easy access rate now pays the same as Coventry's 'loyalty' account.

Tandem's easy-access account also pays 0.65 per cent and it provides instant access to savings, and allows unlimited deposits and withdrawals to a linked current account.

Other best buy options include Skipton's and Coventry's very own easy-access accounts but these also come with limitations.

Skipton pays 0.6 per cent, but limits savers to three withdrawals a year whilst Coventry, paying 0.55, allows six withdrawals per year after which savers forfeit 50 days interest.

In terms of other banks that reward loyalty, the list is hard to establish.

Cynergy Bank, for example, offer its existing savers, higher rates than it does to new customers.

'There are other banks who offer loyalty rates but many don't publish theirs - that doesn't mean they don't exist,' said Blower.

'Several of the new entrant banks, like PCF Bank for example, offer loyalty rates to savers at maturity which are better than those on sale to new customers.'

Loyalty aside, savers who are prepared to stash their cash away for a year or more without needing access, can achieve better returns by turning to a fixed rate deals, where there has been more competition and subsequently far better rates than instant-access.

The best one-year fixed rate account, offered by Zopa Bank, is currently paying interest of 1.12 per cent, while the best two-year deal by QIB (UK) is paying 1.37 per cent.

The billionaire offloaded 10.5million shares – about 4 per cent of the space-travel firm – leaving him with an 18 per cent stake.

The proceeds will support Branson's travel and leisure businesses, as well as help develop new ventures.

Light headed: Sir Richard Branson remains Virgin Galactic's biggest shareholder

Branson, 71, remains Virgin Galactic's biggest shareholder. The company's shares fell 1.5 per cent in New York in early trading. Last weekend Virgin Atlantic, the airline majority-owned by Branson's group, said it was considering a public offering in London as the company searches for more sources of funding.

The airline has been one of the hardest hit in the pandemic due to its reliance on flights to the US. Last year it put administrators on stand-by before the firm was rescued with a £1.2billion package, which required a £200million injection from Branson.

Virgin hopes it can persuade investors it will bounce back once transatlantic travel starts up again.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Bonanza: At results time, some companies are also announcing significant one-off bonuses in the form of 'special dividends'

Following a famine during lockdown, dividend payments are beginning to roar back and create quite a tempting income feast.

And it's not just regular dividends, typically paid half-yearly or quarterly, that are creating the feeding frenzy.

At results time, some companies are also announcing significant one-off bonuses in the form of 'special dividends' after finding surplus cash on their balance sheet.

According to dividend monitoring expert Link Group, £1.4billion of special dividends were paid during the second quarter of this year by UK listed companies – far more than during the whole of 2020.

The momentum is such that Link Group forecasts that UK special dividends will total a staggering £12billion for 2021 as whole.

These dividends can be much higher than regular dividends, sometimes even amounting to 20per cent or more of a company's share price.

Why do companies pay special dividends?

Some of the biggest special dividend payouts occur when a company has raised a lot of cash by downsizing – or spinning off a subsidiary.

For example, in February Tesco paid a special dividend of 51 pence per share – then worth just over £3 each – following the sale of its Asian supermarkets.

And, last month, water company Pennon paid a special dividend of £3.55 per share – then worth about £17 each – after selling its waste management business.

But special dividends can simply be paid because a company has enjoyed a purple patch in terms of earnings.

Rather than using this money to make an acquisition, invest in research and development, or improve other aspects of its operations, it decides to give a slice to shareholders.

Paying a special dividend can prove a more attractive way of doing this than raising the regular dividend, which may not prove sustainable in the long run.

Although special dividends were traditionally viewed as a one-off payment, there is now a trend for some companies to use them more regularly.

For example, mining companies Ferrexpo and Rio Tinto have already declared two special dividends each this year as a result of booming commodity prices, having paid others in the past.

Will Walker-Arnott is senior investment manager at wealth manager Charles Stanley.

He says: 'There is a general trend in the commodity sector to move away from acquisitions and investing in production to returning money to investors.

'There was a period when it was felt shareholders were losing out as a result of companies being in the habit of making sometimes costly and expensive acquisitions. Now, they are being more disciplined with their balance sheets.'

Insurer Admiral, which paid a special dividend of 22.4 pence per share in June (then worth just over £31), and retailer Next – which will be paying £1.10 per share next month (its shares are currently worth just over £80) – operate in less volatile business sectors.

But they have found the payment of special dividends a good way of returning surplus cash to shareholders when trading has been strong. Guy Foster is chief strategist at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.

He says: 'The interesting thing about Admiral is that it has all the capital it needs to run its business. It doesn't need to reinvest money to increase its profits, so it pays a special dividend virtually every year.

'Next also has good capital allocation and has made regular use of special dividends.'

Use of both one-off and more regular special dividends should accelerate as a growing number of companies realise they have accumulated spare cash as a result of faring better than expected during the pandemic.

In particular, management could be worried that having a surplus of cash on their balance sheets might make them vulnerable to being bought by a private equity predator looking for value not reflected in the company's share price.

There can be drawbacks

Special dividends are not without potential drawbacks. Those wishing to reinvest them to buy more shares may have to pay brokerage fees, while a strong pound can reduce the value of payments made by multinationals in different currencies.

Indeed, Link Group reports that in the second quarter of this year UK special dividends as a whole were reduced by about 10 per cent because 80 per cent of them were declared in US dollars.

More importantly, as with regular dividends, the share price of companies paying special dividends usually falls on the 'ex-dividend date' – the point at which you need to own shares to qualify for the dividend payment.

As a broad rule of thumb, it falls by the amount of the special dividend being paid out, reflecting the resultant decrease in the value of the company. So, what you gain on the roundabouts you lose on the swings.

But sometimes the share price falls by less than the dividend amount – known as 'going ex-dividend well'. On other occasions it falls by more than the dividend amount – known as 'going ex-dividend badly'.

Brewin Dolphin's Foster says: 'If it goes ex-dividend badly, it is typically the case that investors don't think the company can afford to pay that dividend. But, if it goes ex-dividend well, it's because people want to hold shares in the company.

'The most important factor is that the company's management is effecting good capital allocation, making the right decisions about whether they should be investing in building a new factory or returning money to shareholders.'

He adds: 'If, for example, a growth company making regular healthy profits suddenly pays out a special dividend, then investors might have made higher returns if the company had simply reinvested all of the profits in the business.'

Some critics of special dividends even argue that their payment can be a sign that a company has struggled to identify new investment or acquisition opportunities.

How to profit from special dividends

Even though share prices normally fall on the ex-dividend date, they tend to increase when details of the special dividend is announced.

So astute investors can potentially make money by identifying those companies likely to make such announcements.

Are there, for example, certain sectors looking particularly buoyant or individual businesses looking likely to sell off significant assets? Even if the management opts instead for share buybacks (see panel, below left), you should still benefit from an increased share price.

It's a bit like identifying companies that will be takeover targets. Both are speculative strategies and there is no guarantee that either the takeover or special dividend will happen.

But if you restrict speculation to companies with strong financial fundamentals and regard any special dividends that arise as the icing on the cake, you shouldn't go far wrong.

Justin Urquhart Stewart is cofounder of investment platform Regionally.

He says: 'Even if you don't feel confident identifying individual companies, you could look at a sector with a lot of issues in common.

'I wouldn't be surprised if most major British banks start paying special dividends by the end of the year.

'I believe the drinks sector could also present special dividend opportunities, as could the consumer products sector, where companies such as Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser have strong international brands, the value of which aren't properly reflected in their share prices.'

However, some experts stress that they do not regard trying to sniff out stocks that might pay a special dividend as a sound strategy. Some also regard basing a portfolio simply around a search for high yields and headline income as unwise.

Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'Investors need to balance dividend returns with prospects for growth in the value of their shares.

'Companies should also be sought out that reinvest profits into the business to maintain growth.'

Rather than trying to narrow down the number of stocks held, she says: 'A growing portfolio is important, as over time this also means the income it produces will rise, which helps to offset the effects of inflation.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Defiant: Ian Barratt received a warning letter stamped 'enforcement officer visit approved'

Demands from 'BBC bullies' ordering pensioners to pay for their TV licences have led to hundreds of readers proclaiming that they will never surrender and pay up.

The Mail on Sunday has been overwhelmed with emails and letters from over-75s who refuse to pay the new £159 annual levy – even if it means being sent to prison.

An army of TV Licensing enforcers will knock on the doors of more than a quarter of a million pensioners who have yet to purchase a licence from next month.

This follows letters demanding they pay up. Some are already being threatened with visits.

Last week, The Mail on Sunday reported how – masquerading as 'customer care' visitors – these doorstep enforcers will confirm that people have a TV and then order them to pay up.

This attack on the purse strings of the elderly and most vulnerable follows the scrapping of the free TV licence for over-75s by the BBC last August, although it gave them a year's grace in the form of a 'transition period', which ended two weeks ago.

While most of the four million pensioners targeted have already paid up, a hard core of 260,000 are standing firm – refusing to be bullied into paying.

Failure to pay for a TV licence – required by law to watch live television on any channel – can lead to prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000. If payment is not forthcoming, the courts can imprison offenders.

Many pensioners are furious that the BBC has broken its previous promise to always provide a free TV licence for the elderly – most of whom earned this reward after a lifetime of payments.

Others, including 60,000 surviving on less than £180 a week, argue that they were not warned to budget for the extra fee and are already struggling under the weight of soaring energy and council tax bills.

There is also widespread anger at the huge 'waste' in the BBC – frittering licence fees on salaries of over £150,000 a year on at least 150 'senior leaders' and presenters.

The BBC has also been widely criticised for its politically correct agenda. Examples include paying 'creative diversity director' June Sarpong £267,000 a year for a three-day week – on top of private earnings from corporate events, for which she charges £5,000 to £6,000.

Ian Barratt, from Maldon in Essex, is among those TV Licensing has targeted. The married 78- year-old found an 'enforcement visit approved' letter thrust through his letterbox a few days ago – with threats that an 'enforcement officer' could visit imminently.

The letter says: 'Our officers visit an address every six seconds. Day. Evening. Even weekends. And if no one answers, they can come back.'

Ian, who is receiving treatment for cancer, says: 'We must stand up to the BBC bullies. I am so incensed by its arrogant attitude towards pensioners. I am one of the lucky ones because I can pay.

'But I am not going to surrender without putting up an almighty fight. No one bothered to consult people like me. They can throw me in jail if they wish.'

The retired journalist, married to Iris, 77, is restricting his viewing so he does not have to buy a licence.

This involves never watching any live TV, but sticking to catch-up or on-demand services such as ITV Hub, All4, My5, Now TV, Apple TV, Netflix and Amazon, as well as DVDs.

Licensing rules mean he cannot watch BBC iPlayer. He says 'Not watching live TV or using BBC iPlayer means I am exempt from paying the licence fee, though that does not seem to cut the mustard with enforcers who continue to hound elderly people like me.'

TV Licensing – the payment collection arm of the BBC – is keen to distance itself from terms such as enforcers and debt collectors by slapping a 'customer care' label on the process, claiming staff are 'specially trained in assisting older customers' and that there is no 'record of interview'.

This means that visits are not recorded, so cannot be used as evidence in court when chasing fees.

Yet it contradicts itself by using the term 'enforcement visit' in the letters it sent to some pensioners.

Roy Hubbarde, from Anstey in Leicestershire, is unimpressed by the way the Corporation is trying to hide the true purpose of the home visits.

He says: 'Why are they describing someone knocking on my door demanding my cash as a 'customer care visit'?

'There is something rather sinister and Orwellian about this BBC approach.'

The married 76-year-old also questions the amount of money being spent in chasing pensioners for money.

According to Citizens Advice, the cost of a bailiff visit – called enforcement – is £235. So the cost of a TV Licensing enforcer's visit could be more than the £159 debt being chased.

BBC CAN THROW ME IN JAIL - I WON'T GIVE THEM A PENNY 'I have tried all my life to be an upstanding citizen, obeying rules. But the BBC enforcers can throw me in jail. My money was too hardearned to give the broadcaster one penny to waste. Let's hope enough of us have the guts and backbone to fight this shameful outfit.' Ann James, 82, Cornwall 'The BBC continues to increase the six and seven figure salaries of already overpaid 'talent' – making paying this the responsibility of pensioners. We do not deserve to have enforcers on our doorsteps threatening us. If they come, we'll politely say: 'No, thank you.' Marion Bailey, 81, West Somerset 'The BBC has gone back on a promise. The problem is the broadcaster likes to spend the £3.5billion it gets from licence fees each year like water. Rather than wasting cash on non-jobs and gameshow prizes, it should budget more carefully.' Christopher Roberts, 80, Northampton 'The BBC has lost its independence and become a spokesman for 'woke'. We want unbiased reporting and this is not what we get. So it can fine me £1,000 or throw me in jail – with three square meals a day and free TV.' Alan Corbett, 80, Derby 'I have informed the BBC that I will not be paying for the rubbish it spews out or for the ridiculous salaries paid to morons. So far no one has even bothered to reply. Bring it on. If enough stand up to this bully it will be interesting.' Mike Hills, 77, St Neots, Cambridgeshire 'My plan is to invite any 'customer care' enforcer who knocks on the door to come in for a chat. I will offer them a cup of tea – my own caring side – and tell them I intend to record our conversation. I wonder what they will say?' Chris Dobbins, 79, Norwich

Roy says: 'BBC founder Lord Reith said its aim was to inform, entertain and educate. But since those fine words, the BBC has totally lost the plot. I refuse to pay for its 'woke' agenda and, if needs be, I look forward to watching TV for free in prison.'

Jan Shortt, general secretary of the campaign group National Pensioners Convention, is particularly fearful for the many thousands of retired people who are struggling to survive on incomes of about £180 a week – for whom this extra bill brings not just additional financial hardship, but tough decisions on how to spend their limited income.

She says: 'For many elderly people who live on their own, the TV provides companionship – and can be a godsend. Sadly, far too many cannot afford the licence fee.'

Shortt points out that an estimated 1.5million households are eligible for a free licence because they receive Pension Credit – but only about 800,000 have so far applied.

The benefit can be claimed if the income of a single pensioner is less than £177.10 a week, or £270.30 for a couple. If Pension Credit is used to top up income to this level, it enables pensioners to be eligible for a free TV licence.

The BBC told The Mail on Sunday: 'Now the transition period is over, our focus is to continue to support everyone to become correctly licensed.

'We appreciate there is a small group that have not yet made arrangements, which is why we have written to them setting out simple steps to take to get set up. It includes a range of payment options to spread the cost.'

It added: 'Customer care visits are planned to begin in the autumn, aimed solely to assist people to become correctly licensed. These will be carried out by members of staff specially trained in assisting older customers.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Survivors of COVID-19 are more likely to have severe symptoms after receiving the first dose of a vaccine when compared to others, a new study finds.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University gathered data from health care workers at its system in Baltimore, Maryland.

They found that people previously infected with COVID-19 were 4.5 times as likely to have severe symptoms from the first dose of the vaccine than others.

The team says the findings present a point of interest in the way the vaccine works, and how COVID-19 can change a person's body in the long-term.

Researchers found that COVID-19 survivors were 4.5 times more likely to have a severe response to the first dose of a vaccine than those who never had the virus. Pictured: A medical officer a Houston's United Memorial Medical Center receives a shot of the Moderna vaccine on December 21

Almost all of the 954 health care workers who took part in the study had antibody responses to the vaccine, whether they experienced symptoms of not.

For the study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers collected data from 954 health care workers.

Each of them were surveyed on whether they have previously been infected with COVID-19, and whether they experienced any symptoms after receiving the vaccine.

Those who did experience symptoms were split into two groups, mild - such as injection site pain, mild fatigue and headaches - and clinically significant - including fatigue, fever and chills.

The team then adjusted the data for age and gender.

Researchers found it was highly unlikely for people who had never been infected with the virus to feel significant symptoms after only one dose.

COVID-19 survivors did sometimes experience symptoms after one shot, though.

The team found that those with a prior COVID-19 infection recorded developed severe symptoms 4.59 times as likely to experience severe as others.

People over the age of 60, females and those who received the Moderna vaccine rather than the Pfizer-BioNTech shots were also more likely to experience severe symptoms.

COVID-19 survivors were less likely to experience a severe reaction to the second shot of the vaccine then the general population, with researchers finding they were 40 percent less likely to react to the shot the second time.

Some patients often fear that not experiencing symptoms means that the vaccine is not working, though that is not the case.

Researchers found the 953 of the 954 health care workers developed strong antibody responses to the vaccine, including those who experienced little to no symptoms of the virus.

The one who did not develop antibodies was taking an immunosuppressant medication, which likely was the reason they did not develop antibodies.

Higher antibody levels were found in those who received the Moderna vaccine, as well.

The link between higher antibody levels and more protection against the virus can not be proven, though researchers believe that the antibodies are what provide a person immunity.

This is not the first study to show COVID-19 survivors interact with the first vaccine dose the same way those who never contracted the virus react to the second.

A Rush University study published earlier this month found that COVID-survivors were developing a strong antibody response to the first dose of the vaccine, though they showed little response to the second.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vodafone will start charging customers roaming fees again with consumers facing paying £2-a-day to use their monthly allowance in Europe.

The network joins EE in re-introducing the charges after the UK left the EU.

Customers will have to start paying from January 2022 although some will be able to cut the cost to £1-a-day by paying for a multi-day pass.

Mobile firms were banned from charging customers extra fees to use their UK allowance of minutes, texts and data in Europe while the UK was still part of the EU.

Vodafone will start charging customers roaming fees with consumers paying out £2 a day

However, now the post-Brexit transition is over, these rules no longer apply.

Vodafone's new £2-a-day flat fee will apply to any customers who sign up to a new contract or renew their existing one on or after 11 August 2021, unless they opt for one of its '4 Xtra' tariffs, which include roaming.

The new charge will not come into force until 6 January and customers can continue to roam for free, subject to a fair usage policy of 25GB per month, until then.

The fair usage policy sets a limit on how much customers can use without being charged extra fees.

If you are an existing Vodafone customer, you will not affected by these charges straight away, but will be when you renew your contract or change plans.

Consumers will also have the option of buying longer 'roaming passes' letting them use their home allowance in Europe.

For example, an eight-day pass will cost £8 while a 15-day pass will cost £15.

A Vodafone spokesperson said: 'We are changing the number of plans that include roaming in our Europe Zone as standard.

'Roaming, in Europe and beyond, will still be included at no extra cost in selected plans, and new roaming passes at £1 per day will be introduced.

'Existing customers will not be impacted by these changes while they remain on their current price plan, and roaming in the Republic of Ireland will still be included for all customers.

Now the post-Brexit transition is over, mobile networks can charge for roaming abroad again

'Fewer than half of our customers roamed beyond the Republic of Ireland in 2019.

'Rather than have all of our customers affected by including the additional costs of roaming into all of our tariffs, customers will be able to choose a plan that comes with roaming included, or purchase an additional roaming pass.'

'Our ambition is to ensure customers don't ever experience "bill shock" when roaming with Vodafone, because all of our plans and passes will have clear usage caps.'

EE also previously revealed it will charge new customers, and those upgrading from July 7, a £2 daily fee from January 2022.

Though it does not include existing customers, anyone who upgrades and renews their contract from the same date will also have to pay.

O2 also revealed customers will be charged £3.50 for every gigabyte used over 25GB - but this means any usage up until this amount will be under their normal plan and not charged extra.

However, Three has not yet announced any plans to change its policy, although it has reduced its fair cap usage from 20GB to 12GB.

This means customers using more than this will be charged.

Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at Uswitch, said: 'Any reintroduction of roaming charges means that consumers are paying a fee to use data and minutes they have already paid for.

'In the aftermath of Brexit, the UK’s biggest mobile providers all said that they had no immediate plans to change their charging models for consumers roaming within the EU.

'It’s disappointing for consumers to see that the situation looks to be shifting, with a risk that roaming at no additional cost could soon be a distant memory for UK residents.

'When it comes to travelling, don’t leave it till the last minute to check the roaming charges for your destination, and always use hotel and cafe Wi-Fi when on holiday where possible.'

Customers are urged to be careful how much data they use when travelling abroad.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former Olympic athlete Matt Gotrel says he struggled to make ends meet after winning gold as a rower for Team GB in Rio, 2016.

Gotrel, 32, told Donna Ferguson he ended up teaching schoolboys how to row just to earn enough money to pay for food.

After getting a job as an engineer, he then became a professional sailor, enabling him to return to competitive sport and compete in last year's America's Cup.

He was awarded an MBE for services to rowing in 2017 and is an ambassador for MyClubGroup.co.uk – an organisation which helps grassroots sports clubs improve their finances.

Golden boys: Matt Gotrel (circled) with his team-mates at the Rio Olympics in 2016

Would you like to be in Japan competing in the Olympics?

Yes. The Olympics are the pinnacle of sport. Each time I watch it, I get goosebumps. I would be lying to myself if I pretended I didn't want to be there competing.

At the same time, I feel like I drew a line under what I achieved in Rio 2016 and it was a good time for me to leave rowing. But competing in the Olympics is special and to me it always will be.

Why do you think the rowers performed so poorly in Japan?

It's been a tough year with Covid. A lot of our rowers have been training alone in their garages. Other European nations were still able to train as a group while we were all locked down.

It's been hard to watch some of the performances, but to say they did poorly is harsh – a lot of the time, these events come down to very small margins. Fourth place could easily have been a medal on another occasion and some of our medals could have been different colours.

Having said that, you can't deny that it hasn't been our best showing ever. There have been a lot of changes in British rowing with head coach Jurgen Grobler leaving and new coaches coming in. There's been a lot of transition for the team, but hopefully they'll come back stronger.

What did your parents teach you about money?

That it doesn't grow on trees and that you need to work hard for it. My parents worked long hours, running their own jewellery business. Money wasn't tight, but they were frugal. For example, I was always into sports, but I never had the best gear. They would always buy my stuff second-hand.

I'm not frugal myself – I like spending, rather than saving – but I am quite sensible with money and like to plan ahead.

Matt said: 'Competing in the Olympics is special and to me it always will be' after winning gold

Have you ever struggled to make ends meet?

Yes. The worst time was probably in 2017, after I had won Olympic gold in the Men's Eight rowing event at Rio.

I decided to retire and not go back to rowing. There was a period where I had no real idea what I was going to do for a living or where my income was going to come from.

That was a tough time. I ended up freeloading a little bit – I moved in with my girlfriend and didn't contribute towards the cost of our accommodation. I was coaching local schoolboys at a rowing club, just so I could earn enough to eat and pay for food.

After about three months, I'd had enough. I still didn't know what I wanted to do – but it got to the point that I felt I had to get a job and pay my own way. I fell back on my engineering degree and went to Rolls-Royce to work as an engineer.

That wasn't a job I consciously wanted to do, or a route I would have gone down if I hadn't been having these financial issues.

It was all a bit of a comedown after Rio. I felt a bit lost. Everything in my life had been leading up to that gold medal in Rio. Then, after that moment, it was hard to figure out what my purpose was, what I was going to do with my life. It took a while to adjust and come to terms with that.

How did you turn your fortunes around?

An old sailing contact got in touch and asked if I'd like to go sailing again as part of a professional team. I had sailed as a kid, but then started rowing at Loughborough University.

So, after I'd worked at Rolls-Royce for a year, I was able to go and be an athlete again. I think being fit and having the discipline of a rower helped me succeed as a sailor.

Being part of a team, aiming for one goal, is what I am used to. It felt natural to be back doing sport again. It's the environment where I am happiest.

My finances improved when I joined the sailing team. Like Formula 1 and cycling, you get big sponsors in the professional world of sailing, whereas rowing is an amateur sport.

As a rower, the maximum grant you can get is £28,000 a year tax-free and even that is based on your performance. As a sailor, you can earn a six-figure sum.

Have you ever been paid silly money?

Yes, because I do quite a lot of motivational talks. I can earn up to £2,000 for a half-hour speech. I talk about my journey and the things I've learned. I also talk about goal setting.

How, as an athlete, you have to just look one step ahead and focus on the job you have to do the next day, rather than the deadline you have in a month's time.

What was the best year of your financial life?

The last tax year ending April 5. I was sailing in the 36th America's Cup for Ineos Team UK. I'd rather not say how much I earned, but it was more than I made when I was rowing.

The most expensive thing you ever bought for fun?

An artwork for £2,000. I'd describe it as an abstract seascape with blues and greens and bits of wood. I have no idea who the artist is – my wife and I just liked it.

What is your biggest money mistake?

Racking up debt on a couple of credit cards after Rio. I ran up about £4,000 and it took me a couple of years to clear it.

The best money decision you have made?

Taking the advice of a financial adviser. While I was a rower, I had quite a lot of disposable income because I hardly spent anything. I trained for six hours every day, even at weekends, and lived in cheap shared accommodation with five other rowers.

Since all I did for years was train, eat and sleep, there was no time to spend.

The adviser helped me start a pension at age 24 and invest through an Isa. By the time I was 29, my Isa had increased in value by about 20 per cent.

That formed my share of the deposit my wife and I put down on our first home in Cheltenham, which we bought for £225,000 in 2017.

We now live in a four-bedroom house, just outside Cheltenham, which we bought just before the pandemic.

What is the one luxury you treat yourself to?

Going skiing. I wasn't allowed to ski when I was rowing because of the injury threat. So I missed out on about seven winters. Now, I try to go once a year if I can afford it. My favourite place is Morzine in France. It typically costs £2,000 including flights.

If you were Chancellor, what would you do?

I would introduce an incentive to homeowners to encourage them to sell to first-time buyers, not buy-to-let landlords. I'd give the seller a one per cent stamp duty cut on their next property purchase if they did that.

Do you donate money to charity?

Yes, I do sporadically. And I always play the National Lottery because I've been on the receiving end of its funding. They support some great causes and do amazing work for sport in our country – from grassroots to Olympic level.

What is your number one financial priority?

To look after my family. My wife recently gave birth to our daughter, Lara. I want to make sure I can always provide for them both.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Flood warnings are a homeowner’s worst nightmare. And if this week’s doomsday report on climate change is anything to go by, extreme flooding is set to become increasingly common.

It means it has never been more important to have first-rate home insurance that will pay out should the worst happen.

For years, households living in flood-risk areas were routinely refused affordable cover.

Warning: If this week’s doomsday report on climate change is anything to go by, extreme flooding is set to become increasingly common

But the launch of the Government’s Flood Re scheme in 2016 has helped hundreds of thousands of homeowners to save hundreds of pounds in premiums.

Yet, as Laura Shannon reports, sneaky small print means that you can still be landed with a hefty bill — even if you don’t live near any river, lakes or the sea.

This is because some insurers charge a separate flooding excess — which is the amount you have to pay before your provider will step in to cover the claim. And in Laura’s case, this was an eye-watering £2,500.

Despite working as a personal finance journalist for more than a decade, I’ll hold my hands up and say I have never heard of a flood excess. And, like Laura, I certainly wouldn’t have thought to check if I wasn’t living in a known flood zone.

Even more baffling was her insurer’s definition of what counts as an ‘outbuilding’.

After conducting my own research (by asking five friends), I can say with authority that no one would ever think that driveways, fences and patios count as an outbuilding when working out how much cover they need.

Laura’s story should come as a stark warning to anyone opting for the cheapest policy they can find on a comparison site.

All-too-often, the scramble to top the best-buy tables sees providers scale back cover or introduce costly exclusions.

Meanwhile, a tick-box approach to buying policies online means it is all too easy to make a mistake on the application form. And as we see time and again at Money Mail, even the smallest error can have devastating consequences and see any future claims thrown out.

In light of Laura’s experience, you can be sure I’ve now dug out my own home insurance policy and scoured the small print with an even keener eye.

I’d highly recommend that you do the same.

Roaming moan

Well, that didn’t take long. After promising not to bring back costly roaming fees for holidaymakers using their mobile phones in Europe, two big UK providers have reneged on their pledge.

For years, these rip-off charges were a massive moneyspinner for greedy phone companies.

So when a clampdown was finally announced in 2017, we cheered.

Even after Brexit, firms were quick to reassure loyal customers they had no plans to reintroduce the fees.

But we should have known their weasel words were not to be trusted. And I’d bet my hat that other providers follow EE and Vodafone’s lead before long.

Given telecoms firms have already slapped customers with price hikes of up to 4.5 pc this year, you would have hoped they’d show greater restraint.

Instead, it looks like it’s back to the old days of having to turn off roaming when you get on a plane to avoid being stung.

Just the trick

In February, I shared how I got a half-price Now TV deal by threatening to cancel my subscription.

But, after six months, the price is back at £9.99, which felt pricey when I also pay for a TV licence, Amazon Prime and Netflix.

Wondering if the same trick might work twice, I logged into my account and clicked ‘cancel’.

Twice the firm tried to lure me back by boasting of the hundreds of boxsets I’d have at my fingertips, before bingo: ‘How about a special offer just for you?’ This time it’s an even better deal at £3.99 a month.

If I wasn’t so thrilled by the saving I’d feel almost guilty. I had no intention of cancelling my subscription — at least not until I have finished watching all eight seasons of Game Of Thrones (I know I’m a few years behind, but I’m hooked!)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jupiter Green invests in companies that put solving environmental problems at the core of their business.

The first thing that springs to many people's minds on this topic is renewable energy, but the investment trust is much broader than that, seeking out opportunities in everything from energy efficiency, to agriculture, the circular economy and sustainable mobility.

Manager Jon Wallace joins us on the latest Investing Show to discuss how the trust looks for the companies that can help improve the environment we live in and make a profit.

Investing in such companies means seeking out growth opportunities with a difference and he gives some of the examples of those it backs, including Renewcell, which breaks down and recycles used textiles, and Hoffman Green Cement, which produces low carbon cement.

Jupiter Green has been around as an investment trust since 2006 but can trace its philosophy's history further back to the fund management house being an early UK pioneer of green investing.

Long-standing Jupiter Green manager Charlie Thomas left Jupiter and the trust recently and Mr Wallace, who has been at the fund manager since 2009 and worked on the trust for the past seven years took over the reins.

Jupiter Green doesn't target companies of a particular size, says Mr Wallace, but its investment skews towards smaller and medium-sized companies as this is where the best value, growth and opportunities lie for innovation and ideas that need to be scaled up quickly.

He says the trust is 'all eyes and ears looking for those ideas'.

The trust has the ability to be nimble in its positions, as it is a relatively small size at £50million and is one of just three trusts in the Association of Investment Companies' Environmental sector, along with Menhaden and much bigger rival, the £1.2billion Impax Environmental Markets.

Jupiter Green has returned 73.6 per cent over the past 12 months, 45 per cent over three years and 108.8 per cent over five years. It is ahead over one year of the 67.3 per cent sector average, but behind the 79.3 per cent three-year and 155 per cent five-year sector averages.

Renewcell - one of the comapnies Jupiter Green invests in - recycles textiles and helps to mdeal with the heavy environmental cost of the clothing industry

By comparison, Impax Environmental Markets is up 298.8 per cent over five years - dragging up the average in a sector containing just three trusts - while the average Global investment trust is up 167.7 per cent over the same period.

Due to its specialist nature and small size, Jupiter Green has a relatively high ongoing charges figure of 1.6 per cent and after a recent rerating in investors' eyes its share price has shifted from a discount to a premium of 4.4 per cent to net asset value.

Rival trust, Impax Environmental Markets, has an ongoing charges figure of 1.02 per cent and is trading at a 5 per cent premium.

One of the most interesting areas that Jupiter Green invests in says Mr Wallace is sustainable agriculture.

Farming is an industry that has come under fire for its environmental impact but the rapid adoption of technology and new methods is changing this and providing interesting investing opportunities, says Mr Wallace.

He also discusses why the trust has just 30 per cent invested in the US - a relatively low figure compared to the country's global stock market standing - and whether that could change under Joe Biden's green push in his presidency.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Pensions have changed radically in recent years and many more people now choose to stay invested in their retirement years.

This brings far greater flexibility on how you use your pension pot - but also much more responsibility, as you must make investment decisions and your fund last.

So what do you need to think about when investing in retirement?

For this Investing Show Live we look at why investing in retirement is different now, the investments that can suit your pension pot and the pitfalls to avoid.

Justin Urquhart Stewart and Matthew Yeates, of Seven Investment Management, joined This is Money editor Simon Lambert at this special event with a live audience and their questions.

In the second part of the show, we look at whether the good times can return for investors.

Volatility is back, delivering a nervous 2018 so far for investors as a strong stock market run in the New Year swiftly turned into a long-awaited correction.

Simon and Justin are joined by Investing Show regular Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, to look at what has caused confidence to run out of steam and whether we should expect more volatility to come - or a return to better times on the back of a stronger world economy.

They assess how healthy stock markets look around the world, discuss whether investors should worry about bonds and inflation, and look for the bright spots to focus on.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I'm disabled and receive Personal Independent Payment and Employment Support Allowance. My wife receives Carer's Allowance.

My pension age will be next November when I am 66-years old. What should I do now? What will happen to me if I apply for a state pension?

Will all my benefits go away or not? What will be best for me? I worked between March 1993 to 2000 before I became sick. I would be very grateful for your advice.

What now? This week's reader is worried how the state pension could affect their disability benefits

Steve Webb replies: The effect on your benefits of reaching pension age and drawing your state pension is different for different types of benefits.

We also need to think about your wife's Carer's Allowance. I should stress that I don't have full details of your personal circumstances so what follows is a general description of the rules.

I will provide some links later on for where you can check your exact personal situation.

Starting with your Personal Independence Payment (PIP), the good news is that this will continue after you reach pension age, provided that you continue to satisfy the other conditions for the benefit.

Although brand new claims for PIP are generally not possible from those over pension age, those who first claimed before pension age can go on receiving PIP into retirement.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

Things are slightly more complicated with your Employment Support Allowance (ESA).

I'm guessing that you have been on ESA for a while and are receiving what is called 'income-based' ESA.

When you reach pension age, you are no longer able to claim ESA. But because you are part of a couple and it looks as though your wife is under pension age, you still come under the 'working age' benefits system.

This means that you would need to claim Universal Credit.

Once you start getting your state pension, every pound of state pension is deducted pound-for-pound from your Universal Credit.

Depending on the size of your state pension, it is possible that your income from state pension will be above the Universal Credit level and you would not be entitled.

However, because help with rent is now included within the Universal Credit system, if you live in rented accommodation you may still get help even if you have a significant state pension.

Things would change again once your wife reaches pension age.

First of all, your wife can claim her own state pension based on her own contributions.

However, assuming that her state pension is bigger than her Carer's Allowance, then her Carer's Allowance would unfortunately stop.

This is because of what are known as 'overlapping benefit rules' which apply when you would otherwise be entitled to two benefits at the same time, such as pension and Carer's Allowance.

Second, if as a couple you are on a low income you could now see if you are entitled to Pension Credit to top up your income rather than Universal Credit.

Although your wife may no longer get Carer's Allowance, she would have what is called an 'underlying entitlement' and this means a slightly higher rate of pension credit could be payable.

There are also additions for pension credit for 'severe disability', but in the case of a couple these generally apply only where both partners are receiving disability benefits in their own right.

As you can see, the rules are complex and depend on whether one or both of you is over pension age.

I would strongly advise you and your wife to get a state pension forecast so that you know how much you will be getting from that source.

You might also find it helpful to talk to a local welfare rights advice service such as Citizens Advice, or to check your position via a benefits calculator website.

The three calculator websites recommended by the Government are:

- Turn2Us (https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org)

- Policy In Practice (https://www.betteroffcalculator.co.uk/#/free)

- EntitledTo (https://www.entitledto.co.uk/benefits-calculator).
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Since the stamp duty holiday came in last summer, there has been a property market mini-boom despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Is it losing puff yet and if not, when is it going to run out of steam and will we see the tax holiday extended?

The typical home added £20,000 of value in 2020 according to the Office for National Statistics, while prices of detached homes are growing far quicker than other housing stock.

On this week's podcast, Simon Lambert, Lee Boyce and Georgie Frost take a look at the latest property market data to dissect what it means.

On 3 March, we will have a Budget. Will it give an indication as to how we could foot the huge bill linked to the pandemic? Will there be tax rises? And are there simple ways to protect your wealth?

How many shares should you hold to diversify and is fund manager Neil Woodford really about to stage a comeback?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There have been some clear winners and losers in the rebound from the stock market crash as coronavirus and lockdown hit.

Tech stars, companies with a strong digital presence and those who have seen business increase as a result of lockdown – from B&Q-owner Kingfisher, to cycle and motoring store Halfords, and takeaway deliverer Just Eat - have been the only game in town.

There have been some clear winners and losers in the rebound from the stock market crash as coronavirus and lockdown hit.

From aerospace engineer Rolls-Royce, to cinema operator Cineworld and travel-focussed caterer and retailer SSP, shares that had been languishing at lowly valuations and clouded by pessimism got a sudden dose of optimism.

So why did they rise so strongly, is this the much-heralded switch from growth to value investing and what does that even mean?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost look at the vaccine rally, whether this marks a new chapter for investors and the economy… and what the risk of being disappointed again is.

Some investors hoping to take advantage this week couldn’t, however, as DIY investing platforms struggled under the weight of record days of trading from customers. Can those Hargreaves Lansdown, or other platform, clients try to claim any money back for trades missed?

Also on this week’s podcast, the potential capital gains tax raid being lined up – with perhaps some unintended consequences – and the surge of Curry’s PC World complains to This is Money.

And finally, the Government is soon expected to bring forward its ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, with the favoured alternative being electric.

But if you act now and go electric but don’t have a driveway for home charging is it practical – and can you take a lead across the pavement instead?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investors wondering whether to put some of their hard-earned cash into the Chinese stock market are faced with a paradox: the country is too big and influential to ignore, but the market is too unpredictable for anything other than a bumpy ride.

The past few days have illustrated the difficulties of investing in a country run by a political elite that tolerates a 'form of phoney capitalism'.

An expected crackdown on online gaming, especially among the young Chinese, sent shares in Tencent – China's largest video games operator – into a tailspin.

This followed in the wake of other crackdowns on China's technology sector. Last month, the Chinese government announced it would be barring tutoring for profit in core school subjects to ease financial pressures on families that have contributed to low birth rates.

Too hot to handle?: It is difficult to invest in a country run by a political elite that tolerates a 'form of phoney capitalism'

The news sent shockwaves through China's vast private education sector, hitting providers' share prices.

The government also ordered app stores to remove Didi Chuxing's app, claiming the ride-hailing company had been illegally collecting users' personal data.

This is after Didi, founded in China in 2012, had just listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The intervention sent Didi's shares plunging.

'Scratch beneath the thin veneer and China is an illiberal, Marxist state where the priorities of the Communist Party will always ultimately take precedence and where political influence weighs heavily on companies,' says Jason Hollands, a director of wealth manager Tilney Smith & Williamson.

'This makes the case for investing in China tricky on so many levels – morally as well as on investment grounds.'

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index has now lost more than 45 per cent of its value since February.

So, does this represent a buying opportunity or, as Hollands suggests, should Chinese investments now be treated with extreme caution?

Too big to ignore... the case for investing in China

'If you haven't got any Chinese exposure in your investment portfolio, you probably need some,' says James Carthew, fund analyst at research company Quoted Data.

Carthew believes there are bargains to pick up after the sharp market falls of recent weeks and months. 'China is too big to ignore,' he adds. 'Its economy continues to grow and its consumers are becoming more affluent.'

Big name companies in China are increasingly household brands across the world.

A record 143 of Fortune's top 500 global companies this year were Chinese, including the likes of online retailer JD.com, technology giant Alibaba, Tencent and electronics company Xiaomi.

Given strong domestic consumption, Carthew believes all these companies have the ability to keep on growing and generating cash – despite the intimidatory actions of China's President Xi Jinping.

Pruksa Iamthongthong is investment director of Asia Dragon, an investment trust run by funds giant Abrdn (previously known as Aberdeen Standard Investments). She is comfortable with the 39 per cent exposure that the £630million fund has in China.

Among its top ten holdings are Alibaba, Tencent and drinks manufacturer Kweichow Moutai.

She says: 'Despite the unsettling events of the past few weeks, we believe the private sector retains a critical role in ensuring that the Chinese economy continues to innovate and prosper – and that China reaches its goal of being a moderately prosperous nation by 2035.'

She believes that despite the government's interference in certain business sectors, the Communist Party does not intend to make the stock market too risky for investors to have confidence in.

She adds: 'A broad, heavy-handed clampdown on private new economy sectors seems unlikely given their importance in underpinning China's economic vision for a modern productive, consumption-led economy.

'As a result, we remain positive about the long-term prospects for Chinese equities.'

143 of Fortune's top 500 global companies this year were Chinese, including retailer JD.com

Experts fear meddling from government

Darius McDermott, managing director at fund scrutineer Chelsea Financial Services, says that the Chinese government's clampdown on key business sectors represents a warning to investors about the risks of investing in Chinese equities.

He says: 'Does the Chinese government want to totally destroy the idea of stock market investing while still having foreign investors investing in their country?

'The answer is probably no, but recent unfriendly regulatory moves clearly represent a power play from them. Investors should take note that further intervention is possible, impacting adversely on some of China's leading listed companies.'

Ben Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial Planning, adds that investors should not be surprised when the Chinese government gets heavy handed.

He says: 'China has always been an interventionist economy, so the fact the government has intervened in recent days and months should be no surprise. It is one of the clear risks of investing in Chinese equities.'

Hollands says: 'Under Xi Jinping, China has moved in an increasingly hardline direction, and recent interventions signal the Communist regime's desire to stamp its authority on the private sector. Investors should take heed.'

KEEP INVESTMENTS MODEST, SAY EXPERTS Most investment experts believe it would be foolish to ignore the Chinese market altogether. 'The long-term case for investing in China's growth story remains intact,' says Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at wealth manager Interactive Investor. 'Growth of the middle classes and the recent refocusing of China's economy towards domestic consumption rather than exports are expected to be key drivers of future economic growth and the stock market in the coming years.' However, it is important to be wary, investing only a proportion of your portfolio in Chinese stocks and picking the right sectors and companies. 'It pays to be selective,' says Abrdn's Pruksa Iamthongthong, adding that investors have 'indiscriminately sold off the broader market', meaning there are opportunities to be had. Jason Hollands agrees that Chinese equity prices now look compelling. He says: 'Sentiment towards China has been severely impacted in recent weeks and this has depressed company valuations, particularly in sectors like technology. 'This clearly creates some buying opportunities for long-term investors. But it is important to be prepared for bumps in the road.' He says that regulatory interventions should be seen as an 'inherent risk' and that investors should take an approach that is 'both selective, but sufficiently diversified'. China should only be a 'modest component of an overall wealth portfolio,' adds Holland.

Spread the risk with a diversified fund

Investing in Chinese shares is difficult. Due to the rules governing foreign ownership of shares, foreign investors have to buy through 'variable interest entities'.

And as Chelsea's McDermott warns, there would be nothing to stop the Chinese government at some stage deciding these structures are worthless.

This is the risk you have to take with China, even if you invest in investment funds. But at least a diversified fund spreads risk.

Some experts suggest that investors should avoid China-only funds and instead opt for a trust or fund that invests throughout Asia. Tilney's top Asian fund selections include Fidelity Emerging Markets and FSSA Asia Focus.

Meanwhile, Chelsea has identified a number of 'elite' Asian funds. These include Fidelity Asian Dividend, Invesco Asian, JPM Asia Growth, Pacific Tiger (managed by Asian specialist Matthews Asia) and investment trust Schroder Oriental Income.

Interactive Investor's Dzmitry Lipski likes Fidelity Asia, Guinness Asian Equity Income and investment trust JPMorgan Emerging Markets.

An alternative approach is to buy a global investment fund that has limited exposure to China. For example, Scottish Mortgage, the country's largest investment trust, has a fifth of its investments in Chinese equities – the likes of Tencent and Alibaba.

But its global investment remit means it has not been hit as hard performance wise as some Asian or China-only funds. Over the past year, it has still managed to achieve a total return for shareholders in excess of 50 per cent.

For those who prefer a pure China fund, Lipski suggests Fidelity China Special Situations. The trust, which has generated a return of 64 per cent over the past three years, has been managed by Dale Nicholls since April 2014.

Lipski adds: 'Due to the single country focus and its bias towards small and mid-sized Chinese companies, its investment return profile is volatile, making it high-risk, and should represent no more than a satellite holding in a well-diversified portfolio.'

Chelsea's McDermott suggests FSSA Greater China Growth, managed by Martin Lau, which he says 'has proven its ability to perform in any market environment'.

The fund has made losses of five per cent over the past six months, but it has delivered respectable gains of 52 per cent over the past three years.

He also likes trusts Fidelity China Special Situations and JPMorgan China Growth & Income which has taken a 27 per cent hit over the past six months – but is up 129 per cent over three years.

Investors should expect this level of price volatility to continue as China's economic transformation marches on – despite a government intent on dictating what its biggest companies can and cannot do.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The chief executive of renewable energy giant Octopus Energy has called for a permanent price cap on energy bills to curb the impact of soaring gas prices.

On Friday, regulator Ofgem increased the price cap by £139 from October 1, pushing up the cost of energy bills for 11million households on variable standard tariffs this winter.

Ofgem said the record 12.2 per cent rise on annual bills, from £1,138 to £1,277, is due to a 50 per cent leap in wholesale energy costs over the first half of the year.

Octopus boss Greg Jackson said the higher bills would be difficult for many households – but that without the price cap, energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds.

Saving the planet: Environmental levies currently make up around 23% of electricity bills compared with less than two per cent of gas bills

He called for the cap – introduced in 2019 by then-Prime Minister Theresa May to end 'rip-off' energy prices – to be extended permanently beyond its current end in 2023. It has so far cut customers' energy bills by £1billion per year.

Jackson said: 'Keeping the price cap in place permanently is something we would love to see from the Government. I cannot see any reason why you'd ever take it away.

'If it weren't for the cap, the prices from the former Big Six suppliers would be between £1,360 and £1,500 each year, based on how they have priced in the past.

'It is colossal how much money the price cap is saving people. It has massively constrained bills despite the huge increases in the cost of energy.'

This month, global wholesale gas prices hit 111.4 pence per therm, or €42.19 per megawatt hour, up from 20.21 pence per therm or €7.73 per megawatt hour in August last year.

The spike in gas prices has been caused by soaring demand from China and India, combined with supply issues due to the pandemic.

Extreme weather patterns across the world have also pushed up demand and caused outages at production plants.

Over the year to date, Britain has imported 64 per cent of its energy, compared with 54 per cent in 2020 and 2019. The bulk of the imports came from Norway, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.

Ofgem increased the price cap by £139, pushing up the cost of energy bills for millions

Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the UK's demand for imported gas will rise 1.5 times by 2030 as its homegrown production falls by 71 per cent over the same period.

The UK no longer has any long-range gas storage and it has almost fully phased out coal generation. Murray Douglas, research director at Wood Mackenzie, said this means high energy prices are here to stay over the next decade.

He added: 'The global gas market will tighten considerably to 2025, with only a temporary reprieve next summer, and the UK will be more exposed to gas price volatility, particularly in winters. The winters through to 2025/26 will be the most challenging.'

The ICE futures index for natural gas shows UK prices climbing to around 144 pence per therm in January.

Energy consultancy Aurora Energy Research expects UK wholesale prices to then drop from current highs to average 52 pence per therm in the mid-2020s before rising to 63 pence per therm in the late-2020s.

Anise Ganbold, research leader at Aurora Energy, said: 'Beyond the late-2020s, we expect prices to continue to rise due to the UK's growing import dependency as its own North Sea production declines.'

Jackson said the UK can now produce electricity from wind at around 5p per kilowatt hour, compared with generating from gas which now costs 9p per kWh. But around 90 per cent of the energy used by dual-fuel customers in the UK still comes directly or indirectly from gas.

He said: 'We need to change that so we escape the soaring global fossil fuel prices, which are partly driven by the fact we are competing with Asia for gas.

'Britain is not in control of our energy prices and it would be great if we could take more control. If we have cheap renewable electricity generated here, it will make bills for UK households cheaper.'

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said last month he is looking at reducing electricity bills by shifting some of the environmental taxes on electricity to gas.

Environmental levies currently make up around 23 per cent of electricity bills compared with less than two per cent of gas bills.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I was all up for eating out to help out last August - even though I never went for Rishi's discount dishes.

As a devotee of the restaurant and pub, I’ve never needed any persuading to go out for a meal, and so during the last inter-lockdown period we headed off gladly to a couple of our favourite haunts.

Both were disappointing in similar ways.

Our feeling was that the things that had made eating out special – foregoing the hassle of shopping and cooking, the ritual of choosing and ordering, good quality food in a civilised atmosphere, enjoyed at leisure – had each deteriorated in some way.

There are some temporary supply and demand side factors at play in inflation but prices go up a lot easier than they come down. Life in the hopefully-post-pandemic world will be significantly more expensive.

Plus, I’ve spent decades rationalising London prices, but it all seemed drastically expensive.

Why on earth go out and spend a packet on a mediocre meal when you can eat and drink better at home on half the amount?

Even for a lover of the social hubbub, the circle is hard to square.

Likewise the spontaneity and geniality of popping to the pub for a pint with a friend, or with the newspapers, have been – again, hopefully just for the moment – extinguished.

Pub managers seem to be keen on many of the necessities imposed by the pandemic: booking tables, ordering via an app, everyone eating, no drinking or standing at the bar.

For some of us, the pandemic has accelerated a long-time trend: the sterilisation (in more ways than one) of pubs and the pub-going experience.

So we have retrenched into a more domestic life. And the more the savings build, the more it seems like a good idea.

The Government and most businesses want us all to go out and spend again. In May, consumers borrowed more money than they paid off for the first time since August 2020, according to the Bank of England.

Consumer confidence is on the up - but is that confidence misplaced?

The anecdotal inflation that many of us are observing at the weekly shop, or the interval drink at the theatre bar or the B&B booking, is already coming through in official figures.

There are some temporary supply and demand side factors at play but prices go up a lot easier than they come down. Life in the hopefully-post-pandemic world will be significantly more expensive.

But rising prices are just the beginning. Even though it’s massively improbable that the Bank of England will raise the bank rate today, it won’t be long before they and other central banks do.

People used to cheap credit in all forms, but especially mortgages, have for the last decade or more taken advantage of rock-bottom interest rates to build up levels of debt that are just about serviceable. (Though admittedly not yet at the same proportion of income as was seen before the financial crisis.)

There has been a big surge in mortgage lending. But bank accounts need to be balanced at some point.

A rate rise of 1 or 2 per cent, however, will create a whole new – and for many unprecedented – set of circumstances. Particularly for those unable to access the cheapest home loan deals.

And this is before one considers the inevitable impact of tax rises, as the Treasury recoups the ongoing cost of the pandemic and Boris’s levelling up agenda.

Frozen income tax thresholds, a national insurance contribution hike... a nibble at pension tax relief here, council tax increases there… wherever you stand on the virtues or otherwise of tax and spend, it all adds up.

It doesn’t make sense for a heavily indebted household to go out and spend at a time like this. I feel for those involved in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors, but the consumer cannot be relied upon to keep the economy afloat this time.

It’s a time to persist with thrift until the new cost of living becomes clear.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The economy will still grow by 7.25 per cent this year, despite the pingdemic

The economy will still grow by 7.25 per cent this year, the Bank of England has predicted – despite a slowdown caused by the 'pingdemic' and growing fears around the Delta variant.

Output climbed by a better-than-expected 5 per cent in the second quarter of the year, but growth will slow to 3 per cent in the third quarter, the central bank said.

Even so, the economy will reach its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year. But inflation will climb to 4 per cent later this year – double the Bank's target – as supply chain bottlenecks and staff shortages cause chaos.

Despite Threadneedle Street's admission that the cost of living is set to soar, officials on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates steady at 0.1 per cent yesterday.

But there were some murmurings of dissent over the Bank's £875 billion money-printing programme, as one official, Michael Saunders, voted to reduce its size to £830 billion. The Bank re-started the programme, known as quantitative easing (QE), during the pandemic to inject more cash into the economy, and dropped interest rates to rock-bottom.

As activity has begun to pick up, some experts are worried that the economy could overheat and inflation will soar if the full £875 billion QE programme goes ahead. However, the Bank thinks unemployment will not climb any further from 4.8 per cent – even when the furlough scheme, which is still paying the wages of around 1m staff, ends in September.

Governor Andrew Bailey said: 'This points to the success of economic policy measures in avoiding a marked rise in unemployment, in the face of such a large downturn in economic activity.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the few positives of successive lockdowns was that credit card debt plummeted and we became a nation of savers instead.

But now shoppers are back out on the High Street in their droves and in May, consumers borrowed more money than they paid off for the first time since August 2020, according to the Bank of England.

And the trend looks set to continue, with credit card lending at £100 million in June. But borrowers should brace themselves, as the post-pandemic world of plastic looks very different.

There were just 122 credit cards available at the end of last month, down from 162 two years ago, according to data analysts Moneyfacts

There are far fewer credit cards from which to choose, interest rates are higher and fees for spending abroad are more expensive.

The median credit card rate increased from 20.9 per cent in the first three months of 2020 to 21.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 — despite the Bank of England base rate remaining at an all-time low of just 0.1 per cent, according to consumer group Fairer Finance.

And several major providers inflicted even harsher rate rises on borrowers. NatWest increased the rate on its Reward card from 23.7 per cent to 26.8 per cent between May 2020 and July 2021.

On a £2,500 balance cleared over five years, this would cost you around £217 more in interest according to Fairer Finance.

The interest rate on Santander’s All In One card rose from 21.7 per cent to 23.7 per cent — an extra £139 over five years and £333 over ten. And the rate on TSB’s Advance Mastercard jumped from 7.9 per cent to 9.9 per cent — £134 and £297 respectively.

James Daley, of Fairer Finance, says: ‘Credit card providers have been slowly ratcheting up their interest rates for more than a decade. Worse still, some lenders have locked in a link with Bank of England base rate, so that when rates begin to rise again, credit card interest rates will increase further.

‘Sadly, the people who end up paying the sky-high rates are often those who can least afford them.’

Sadly, the people who end up paying the sky-high rates are often those who can least afford them

And there is bad news for holidaymakers, as the cost of making purchases and withdrawing cash abroad has increased too. The median foreign purchase fee rose from 2.85 per cent in the first three months of 2020 to 2.95 per cent in the second quarter of 2021, figures from Fairer Finance show.

The average cash withdrawal fee rose from 2.97 per cent to 3.31 per cent. And Lloyds Bank hiked its credit card cash withdrawal fee to 5p per cent. There are also fewer credit cards offering free spending abroad, compared with the start of the pandemic. In fact, there is less choice in general.

There were just 122 credit cards available at the end of last month, down from 162 two years ago, according to data analysts Moneyfacts. The number of 0 per cent balance transfer deals — which allow borrowers to reduce the cost of expensive debt — also decreased to 60 from 81 in July 2019.

Last year, the Financial Ombudsman received 15,608 complaints about credit cards. Three in ten were upheld in favour of the customer. The most commonly reported problems were difficulties getting refunds for cancelled holidays and events, and c­oncerns over providers hiking credit limits to unaffordable levels.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tough lockdown restrictions helped orders at food delivery giant Deliveroo double in the first half of the year.

Hungry customers who were unable to visit restaurants and pubs for much of the period ordered 148.8 million meals through the firm's app compared to 74.5 million during the same time last year.

Gross transaction value (GTV) also doubled from £1.7billion to £3.38billion as demand continued to remain strong even when curbs on eating out were loosened.

However, the London-based firm still made a massive pre-tax loss of £104.8million and has yet to make a profit since being set up by former investment banker Will Shu in 2013.

Lockdown boost: Hungry customers who were unable to visit restaurants and pubs for much of the period ordered 148.8 million meals through Deliveroo's app

Both the group's British Isles and international markets performed exceptionally well, with GTV in the former region up by over 200 per cent on their 2019 levels and 110 per cent higher than last year.

The newly-listed company also said it now has the largest number of active food merchants among food delivery businesses in the UK after adding around 10,000 new sites in the second quarter alone.

It recently expanded its partnership with the supermarket Waitrose and announced a tie-up with Sainsbury's, taking the number of grocery sites from which it delivers to around 4,600.

The American-born founder said: 'We have reported strong performance in the first half of the year and continued to make good progress in executing our strategy. As a result, I believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the huge opportunity ahead.

'We are seeing strong growth and engagement across our marketplace as lockdowns continue to ease. Demand has been high amongst consumers.'

Expansion: During the first half of the year, Deliveroo launched a tie-up with the supermarket Sainsbury's and expanded its partnership with Waitrose

But though the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated its orders, Deliveroo said the lockdown bounce is likely to ease off in the second half of the year.

The group's shares closed trading 6.1 per cent lower at £3.41 on Wednesday after rising significantly yesterday following the announcement that its German rival Delivery Hero had purchased a small stake in the online firm.

They flopped disastrously when they were listed on the London Stock Exchange earlier this year due to investor concerns about staff working conditions and the company's high losses.

It had hoped to sell shares for 390p each when it listed, but within just a couple of weeks, the share price hit a low of 225p. Since then, it has recovered much of that ground but still lags behind the initial optimism.

Troubles: Deliveroo made a pre-tax loss of £104.8million in the first half of 2021 and has yet to make a profit since being set up by former investment banker Will Shu eight years ago

Adam Vettese, an analyst at online investment firm eToro, warned that investors would 'eventually' want to see critics' concerns about the treatment of employees and profitability addressed.

'If Deliveroo can't do that, then it may find it a struggle to attract investors' cash, regardless of whether its numbers impress or not,' he remarked.

Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes Deliveroo's reliance on a 'gig economy model' makes it additionally vulnerable.

She said: 'So far, it's shaken off attempts to change the self-employed status of its riders in the UK but has pulled out of Spain due to legal changes requiring food delivery platforms to hire staff and not pay them as independent contractors.

'It could face further difficulties expanding globally if legislators elsewhere look again at workers' rights in the sector.'

Streeter added that Deliveroo's 'longer-term outlook depends on how demand holds up in a post-pandemic world, and if that road to profitability looks any clearer.'

The company's results come a day after it announced that Amazon's Vice President of Global Supply Chain, Devesh Mishra, has been appointed its next chief product and technology officer.

Deliveroo is already hiring another 400 people for new high-skilled technology jobs such as software engineers and data scientists to help strengthen its platform.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gatwick airport's boss says airlines such as British Airways should 'use or lose' their landing slots.

In what may be seen as a shot across the bows of BA – which halted short-haul flights from Gatwick last year – Stewart Wingate said other airlines were lining up to take the slots.

Going nowhere: British Airways halted short-haul flights from Gatwick last year

He told The Mail on Sunday: 'BA has already made public their position that because of the slot waiver they'll not be flying short-haul during this summer season.

'If BA were to consider selling their slots, we know there's demand from the likes of easyJet, Wizz Air and others to take the slots from them.'

He added: 'Virgin has made clear to us they certainly will be maintaining their slot portfolio. We do expect Virgin and Delta to start flying in the months ahead.'

Wingate said the Government needs to bring back rules – suspended to help airlines through Covid – that force carriers to use their spaces.

He added: 'One of the things that's holding us back is the 'slot waiver' the British Government continues to put in place.

'We're certainly pressing the Government for the summer of 2022 to put the right incentives in place to have airlines use the scarce slots that are available.'

He warned that the UK is lagging Europe, which has already brought back rules so airlines must 'use or lose' their spaces this winter.

Gatwick last week reported a net loss of £245million in the first half of the year as passenger numbers plunged to 569,000.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nationwide is on a mission to lure in new current account customers, offering cash bribes of up to £125 to potential switchers.

Britain's biggest building society will pay £125 to existing members who switch their current account, while completely new customers will receive £100 for switching.

For switchers to be deemed a member and qualify for the more generous switching bribe, they will need to either hold a savings account or residential mortgage with Nationwide.

Members must use Nationwide’s Internet Bank to switch a current account they hold with another provider to an existing account they already hold with the Society or open a new account to switch to using Nationwide’s website, Internet Bank or Mobile Banking App.

Switches must be made using the Current Account Switch Service (CASS) and a minimum of two active direct debits must be set up on the new account.

For those who already have a Nationwide current account, they can still benefit, but they'll have to switch a current account over from another provider.

Tom Riley, director of banking and savings at Nationwide, said: 'We always look to reward our members' loyalty with exclusive products and services.

'This is why our new switching incentive offers a higher level of reward for existing members compared to those who are new to the society.

'We believe our mutual difference is the reason that the society continues to be one of the main winners of the Current Account Switch Service as people look for a provider that will not only offer a compelling account, but also one that has a strong focus on reward member loyalty.'

What's behind the cash incentive?

Nationwide has gained 590,255 more current account switchers than it has lost since the start of 2014 when the CASS began, according to analysis by MoneyComms.

This is more than any other current account provider. Santander, the next most successful provider, made a net gain of 323,483 during that time.

But, in the final six months of last year Nationwide lost 7,382 more customers in switches than it gained. For the first time since the CASS began, it recorded customer losses over consecutive three month periods.

Although it regained some ground in the first three months of this year, recording 1,474 switches, the society was still a long way short of both Starling Bank and Virgin Money, which made net gains in excess of 17,000.

Nationwide may therefore be hoping that its new cash incentive will enable it to return to its winning ways, particularly given the lack of competitive switching offers across the market as a whole.

Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts said: 'The switching offer from Nationwide is notable, especially as many current account providers pulled their own offers over the past few months.

'It could be timed to entice customers when there is little incentive to move elsewhere.'

What perks are other banks offering?

Cash bribes have been a rarity for current account switchers over the past year, and those that do appear are often short lived.

HSBC is currently dangling a £140 cash carrot in a bid to lure in new current account customers, albeit only until this Thursday.

Similarly, Virgin Money is offering joiners a £150 Virgin Experience Days gift card allowing its customers to choose between thousands of experiences from spa days and short breaks to sky diving.

Cash carrot: HSBC is offering current account switchers an £140 cash bribe until 19 August

Nationwide has not said when the incentive will expire, and its simple cash offer may make it more appealing to some than Virgin's voucher offering.

The offer applies to any one of Nationwide's three main current accounts. This includes its FlexDirect account, which pays 2 per cent interest on balances up to £1,500 and has a fee-free overdraft for the first 12 months, as long as customers pay £1,000 each month into the account.

Those unable to meet the £1,000 monthly requirement can opt for Nationwide's FlexAccount, which allows them to bank online and in branch for no fee.

For those seeking a more comprehensive package, the FlexPlus account includes worldwide family travel insurance, mobile phone insurance, UK and European breakdown cover and no transaction fees for using a debit card abroad – albeit for a fee of £13 per month.

However, whilst the cash bribe and choice of accounts might tempt many people to switch to Nationwide, there are other factors that experts say are also important to consider.

Starling Bank is rated as the number one provider for service levels, according to the latest annual survey by the consumer group, Which?

These include customer service, overdraft limits, interest rates, cashback, saving perks and an array of other niche benefits such as cinema tickets.

Starling Bank, for example, doesn't offer incentives to switchers, instead relying on the strength of its customer service and its app.

'Switching current accounts has many advantages, whether it be to acquire a perk or even to save money from a more cost effective overdraft tariff or to gain a better level of service,' said Springall.

'Customers may be better off picking an account with a package of benefits instead of choosing an account for its upfront perk, however. Incentives are only worthwhile if consumers make good use of them.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Binky Felstead has sparked a debate over whether you should sterilise a baby's bottle before using it or just put it through the dishwasher.

The mother-of-two welcomed her son Wolfie in June and on Monday prepared for her first foreign holiday with her new arrival, daughter India, four, and husband Max Darnton.

Taking to Instagram she shared sweet snaps of the family boarding the plane as she explained how they had surprised India with the trip - prompting several in the comments to ask for her advice on travelling with children.

Discussion: Binky Felstead has sparked a debate over whether you should sterilise a baby's bottle before using it (pictured with husband Max and children India, four and Wolfie, six weeks)

One wrote in the comments: 'I'd love to know how you packed for a baby? We want to go away with our baby but have no idea what to do about packing for him...Things like sterilisers, bottles, pram set etc?'

Binky then replied directly to the woman, saying: 'I personally don't sterilise anymore as feel the dishwasher does the trick! But ovs lots of bottles, muslins, sun hat, cream, nappies & I packed a few little summer rompers but to be honest it's so hot he's just in nappies most of the time!! So really simple!!'

NHS guidance on sterilisation states dishwashers will clean feeding equipment but not sterilise it.

The comment over sterilising then sparked a debate under the post with one writing: 'Milton tablets are excellent for sterilising and super small to pack. All you need is a large bowl or bucket where you are staying (should sterilise bottles until you stop using formula).'

Another wrote in response to the suggestion of using Milton tablets: 'Really great advice esp about continuing to sterilise bottles.'

A third penned: 'The dishwasher will clean but doesn't sterilise. Little ones tummy's are so sensitive to bacteria and upset you should sterilise until 12 months. The dishwasher doesn't reach high enough temperatures to sterilise.'

Debate: Under her holiday post Binky was asked for advice on travelling with children to which she responded that she uses a dishwasher instead of sterilising Wolfie's bottles

Opinions: The comment over sterilising then sparked a debate under the post with one writing: 'The dishwasher will clean but doesn't sterilise. Little ones tummy's are so sensitive to bacteria and upset you should sterilise until 12 months'

NHS guidance on sterilising baby bottles It's important to sterilise all your baby's feeding equipment, including bottles and teats, until they are at least 12 months old. This will protect your baby against infections, in particular diarrhoea and vomiting. Before sterilising, you need to: Clean bottles, teats and other feeding equipment in hot, soapy water as soon as possible after feeds. Use a clean bottle brush to clean bottles (only use this brush for cleaning bottles), and a small teat brush to clean the inside of teats. You can also turn teats inside out then wash them in hot soapy water. Do not use salt to clean teats, as this can be dangerous for your baby. You can put your baby's feeding equipment in the dishwasher to clean it if you prefer. Putting feeding equipment through the dishwasher will clean it but it does not sterilise it. Make sure bottles, lids and teats are facing downwards. You may prefer to wash teats separately by hand to make sure they are completely clean. Rinse all your equipment in clean, cold running water before sterilising. The advice above applies to all your baby's feeding equipment, and whether you are using expressed breast milk or formula milk. Source: NHS Advertisement

Off we go! Binky shared a sweet picture in the post holding her baby as India beamed up at the camera

Binky explained in the caption about preparing for her trip, penning: 'FAMILY VAY- KAY • ☀️

'When I was about India's age my parents packed my bags in the car whilst I was asleep & when they woke me up in the morning they told me we were going to drop daddy off at the airport for one of his usual business trips!

'It wasn't until I was actually on the plane that they had to tell me it was actually a holiday we were going on.. and I still remember how excited I was!!

'So … Max & I told India the day before we left that we were going to pack her bag & pretend we were going to go on a holiday. We packed the car when she was sleeping. In the morning we woke up the kids, put them in the car & told India we were going to take her to the park.

Surprise! Binky explained in the caption that they hadn't told India that they were going on a family holiday

'We got to the airport, put her on the luggage trolley & she had the biggest smile on her face ( clearly brighter than I was) … we told her it wasn't actually a pretend holiday and that we were going on a airplane & she let out the biggest squeal and skipped through the airport saying ' hi! ' to everyone.

'Needless to say travelling with two compared to one is slightly different … at least Wolfie can't walk yet- much easier! He did sleep most of the way and I made sure he sucked on his dummy (or my finger) to help pop his ears! We had India in the middle between Max & I & Wolfie was on my lap!

'I actually traveled from London to Bali with India the day after her 2nd Birthday on my own & it was actually okay, just made sure I was super prepared! Advice travelling with kids hasn't changed from my post I did back then. Make sure there are plenty of snacks, stickers, colouring books & toys! Spread the toys out throughout the flight… and promise ice cream when you land!! ☀️ … oh and think of that G&T!

… also, this little bag India is on in the last pic is brilliant for plonking them on whilst waiting around for check in & running through airports when late for your flight!'

Binky and Max tied the knot during an intimate civil ceremony at Chelsea Old Town Hall on Friday 23 July.

Their surprise ceremony took place seven weeks after Binky and Max welcomed their son Wolfie.

Binky also shares daughter India with ex-boyfriend Josh 'JP' Patterson, who Max is doting stepfather to.

Announcing the news in HELLO! magazine, Binky called it 'the most perfect day', with Max adding: 'It's amazing. To be honest, it felt official when Wolfie was born because of him and India being siblings, but getting married has cemented it.'

Love: Binky and Max tied the knot during an intimate civil ceremony at Chelsea Old Town Hall on Friday 23 July

He went on: 'Binks looked incredible. India swung the door open just before she walked down the aisle so I got a sneak peek, but I pretended I didn't.'

After the ceremony, Binky called on the likes of her former Made In Chelsea star Ollie Locke to get the party started as they headed back to their home for drinks and dancing.

Binky and Max will also host a bigger ceremony in Corfu next summer, with Max telling the outlet that they plan to have a BBQ on the beach and go snorkelling.

They have already hired a 'big boat to sail around the coves' and have also secured a cliffside venue for their wedding.

Max added that they've rented a private beach where they can enjoy a meal after the ceremony with their loved ones.

Images shared with the magazine reveal that Binky opted for a beautiful silk dress that featured lace detailing across her shoulders.

Businessman Max also opted for white, with his suit being a slightly darker shade to Binky's stunning dress.

Writing about the big day in an Instagram post, Binky penned: 'BLIMEY- WE ARE MARRIED!!!! @max_fd

Doting parents: Their surprise ceremony took place seven weeks after Binky and Max welcomed their son Wolfie into the world

'Had one of the most special days of my life marrying my best friend. My gorgeous, beautiful daughter being my flower girl, passing/dropping us the rings …my big brother giving me away… and Wolfie sleeping the whole way through!

'This was an intimate family day given all of the ever changing rules… Bring on next year when we do it all again to celebrate & party with all our loved ones and friends!!☀️ We’ve found a perfect sunny location!!'

The pair revealed they were engaged to be married after 19 months of dating in a sweet Instagram post shared in September 2020 after meeting at Soho Farmhouse.

She revealed the good news via Instagram as she shared a picture of her kissing the businessman while holding up her hand to show off the sparkling diamond ring.

Gushing about the proposal, which took place after he asked her daughter, for permission to pop the question, she wrote: 'The easiest "Yes" EVER!'

In the sweet snap, Binky passionately kissed her beau after she had accepted his proposal, which took place in a picturesque field at the Long Man of Wilmington.

In November, Binky admitted she wouldn't be with Max if 'marriage wasn't in the plan', but insisted she didn't 'mind' when the couple decide to tie the knot.

Rylan thanked fans for their support and revealed he is working towards returning to his jobs.

He made the decision to step down from presenting stints such as Eurovision and his BBC Radio 2 show after his marriage broke down.

Taking to Instagram in July, he penned: 'I just wanted to write a message to thank you all for the love and kindness you have shown us.

'We are currently prioritising our mental health and looking after the ones around us we love the most. I am working towards getting back to the jobs I love in due course. Thank you for being patient with me X'.

With the return to work on the star's radar, Rylan is reportedly set to make his television comeback on Strictly Come Dancing's spin-off It Takes Two.

According to reports in The Sun, Rylan will return to the BBC2 show after co-presenting it alongside Zoe Ball for the past two years.

With 50-year-old Zoe quitting It Takes Two back in May, Rylan will allegedly sit alongside Strictly professional Janette Manrara, 37, for the extra ballroom dancing instalment which is starting next month.

Last month it was revealed that former Pussycat Doll Nicole and Simon Cowell are 'amongst the stars rallying around the presenter' who is in a 'very dark place' amid the breakdown of his marriage.

It was reported that Katie Price, 43, has 'been his rock' as he comes to term with what has happened, while Ruth Langsford has also been offering her support.

A source told Closer: 'Katie Price in particular has been his rock over the last few weeks, and given she's been through three marriage splits herself, she understands the torment he's going through.

'Nicole has also been messaging him and has given him a list of books that have helped her through painful break-ups.'

The source further revealed to the publication that Rylan was in a 'very dark place' but found it 'hugely comforting' to have his friends supporting him.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Picture it. Having settled for a staycation this summer, you’re finally contemplating a long-awaited trip to Europe. A New Year weekend away, a spring break or a skiing holiday.

Not so fast. While baffling traffic-light systems and quarantines will, hopefully, be history (or at least less complicated), Covid tests are likely to remain a requirement.

And now beleagured British travellers must face up to another source of expense and stress: the return of the roaming charge incurred when they use their mobile phones abroad.

Call costs: Beleagured British travellers must face up to another source of expense and stress: the return of the roaming charge incurred when they use their mobile phones abroad

When the charges were outlawed in the EU in 2017, travellers breathed an enormous collective sigh of relief.

So the move by two grasping telecoms companies, at a time when weary Britons are looking forward to new horizons again makes the heart sink.

It is an appalling backward step to the bad old days when unwary travellers would return home to shock mobile bills often running into thousands of pounds — sometimes more than the price of their holiday.

Maybe they’d used Google Maps to find their way around an unfamiliar city, oblivious to the data-hungry programme running in the background. Or downloaded a TV programme or a film. Or perhaps a games-addicted teenager on a family holiday was unable to go without their daily fix.

Whatever the cause, roaming was a recipe for truly terrifying tariffs.

Following that EU ruling in 2017, telecoms companies could no longer slap on exorbitant costs and were permitted only to charge customers using their mobile phones in another EU country the same as in the UK.

Brexit put an end to this arrangement, but all the big mobile operators denied they had any plans to exploit it. Now these reassurances turn out to be nothing more than cynical hot air.

To widespread fury, Vodafone has just announced that it intends to follow the lead of EE and resume roaming charges from January.

Vodaphone’s UK boss, Ahmed Essam, says the decision ensures ‘moving towards a fairer way to charge for roaming in Europe’.

He is fooling no one. This is not about ‘fairness’ at all.

Mobile phone giants are desperate to recoup the lucrative income stream they lost when roaming charges were scrapped. Too bad that it comes at the expense of their own customers.

The so-called justifications are flimsy, to say the least.

Vodafone, for example, puts forward two arguments, neither of them convincing.

First, it claims most of its customers are not regular roamers and don’t often use their phones abroad.

Therefore, they are being forced to pay for a service they don’t use, in order to subsidise the minority who do — at a loss to the company, it claims.

But if Vodafone is serious about this ‘cross-subsidy’ argument, then it has a duty to slash bills for the majority who do not roam. That won’t happen any time soon.

Second, the company pleads it needs huge sums for investment to improve provision to rural areas, ensure new security requirements and the roll-out of 5G.

Vodafone is a FTSE 100 company which made profits of £3.8 billion in the year to the end of March.

Admittedly, even for a business of this stature, the sums involved in the future telecoms network are huge. But it should not be financing its investment programme by gouging its own customers.

Anger: Vodafone and EE are bringing back roaming charges for people who use their mobile phones abroad

Higher phone bills are probably not much of a worry for chief executive Nick Read, who made £3.7 million in pay and incentives last year.

Rival network EE, the offshoot of former state-telecoms company BT, also claims it needs to bring back roaming fees to ‘support investment in our UK-based customer service and leading UK network’.

Again, it is true that BT and its infrastructure division Openreach have a huge investment programme on their hands. Yet this is cutting little ice with EE customers.

‘Nothing more than another cash grab,’ wrote one disgusted user on an EE online forum. ‘The fact you cannot roam anywhere in the world without getting robbed by your mobile carrier in 2021 is just poor.’

Another customer accused BT — which paid a hefty £12.5 billion to buy EE in 2016 — of using roaming fees as an easy way to recoup the money it spent on the takeover.

‘Wow. EE really know how to get their customers to hate them. It’s greed, plain and simple and I despise them for this,’ wrote a third.

These are not sentiments BT’s current boss Philip Jansen, a respected City figure, will be happy to hear.

Under his leadership the company made £1.8 billion profit last year, despite tough conditions. But the harsh truth is he inherited a very flawed business. Previous managements squandered billions of pounds buying football TV rights, overpaying for 3G licences and other follies.

Were it not for serial past incompetence, BT would be in a better financial position, and perhaps its customers would not be picking up the tab.

Similarly, critics point to a string of strategic errors over the past decade at Vodafone under previous bosses, including selling off the Japanese arm and then the U.S. business just before data use soared.

There have been controversies over its low tax bills in the UK and a £4.6 million fine in 2016 by regulator Ofcom uncovered mis-selling, inaccurate billing and poor complaints handling.

At present, EE proposes to charge a flat £2 a day fee for roaming. Vodafone will offer passes costing £1 a day and says the most anyone should end up paying is £2 a day.

Both companies are imposing the charges on new customers and those upgrading from January.

The upbeat Mr Essam claims ‘there will be no unexpectedly high bills’ because it will all be made clear in advance. ‘Everything will be easy to understand,’ he promises.

Even if we stretch credulity and accept this is the case, bringing back charges after promising the opposite is a disgraceful betrayal of trust.

The amounts proposed may not seem exorbitant, although £2 a day would still add up to £112 for a family of four on a two-week holiday.

But we shouldn’t be deceived. This is likely to be merely a toe in the water.

If telecoms companies get away with these charges, roaming bills will soon be pushing into the stratosphere once again.

Other big networks such as O2, Three, and Virgin say they have no plans to follow down this path — but that’s what Vodafone and EE said, too... right up until they reneged on that promise.

Ofcom, the regulator, should intervene before this spreads much further.

Whatever their commercial rationale, these companies made apparent promises they had no intention of keeping — and they should be made to pay for that, not their customers.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I asked Virgin Media for a cheaper landline, TV, broadband and mobile phone deal in February.

I’d been paying £80 per month and was told this could be reduced to £64. But when the contract came through it was for £97 per month.

Instead, I used a switching website to move to TalkTalk — but my Virgin wall socket was incompatible, leaving me with no phone or broadband, so I cancelled the contract.

Nightmare switch: A reader, who was told her phone, TV and broadband bill would be reduced by £16 per month found herself paying £17 per month more after using a switching website

I am 87 and had no phone. A friend organised a temporary landline so I could talk to someone.

But TalkTalk would not cancel my contract as I had an outstanding bill. I paid the bill online and the following day an email arrived saying: ‘Welcome back to TalkTalk.’

Eventually I managed to cancel, but I seem to have lost the phone number I have had for 50 years.

Virgin then offered me a contract at £64 per month, but again, it came through at £97 and there will be a £65 installation fee.

B. J., Bournemouth.

Tony Hazell replies: I’ve had to take some details out of your letter, but the gist is that you were in a right old muddle.

This is hardly surprising: switching phone and broadband suppliers is fraught with pitfalls, not least losing your phone number even when you specify you want to keep it.

TalkTalk now accepts you could not have had a service if you did not have a connection or a socket. It has refunded everything you paid, waived the contract breakage fee and sent £40 as a goodwill gesture.

Virgin has credited £114 to your account and given you a cheaper contract, at less than £60 per month. But you have had to accept a new landline number. To keep a number, a port request must be sent, and something went wrong here.

Thankfully, everything else was resolved. But, at 87, surely you have the right to a decent deal without these shenanigans?

HMRC pinched £3,384.46 from my pension!

I took my pension tax-free lump sum three years ago and now draw £450 per month from it.

Two years ago, in July, I took an additional £10,000 lump sum, on which I paid £1,996 tax. On April 27 this year I did the same, but HMRC has taken £3,384.46!

My pension adviser and pension company say they cannot help me.

J. C., Stourbridge.

Tony Hazell replies: I was extremely surprised neither your financial adviser nor pension company seemed aware of the trap you’ve fallen into, as it has been well-publicised in the trade financial Press and Money Mail. Perhaps they don’t read the papers.

Basically, this problem arose because you took the money at the start of the tax year. HMRC has assumed your income for April will be maintained throughout the year and taxed you accordingly.

The good news is that you can request a repayment using the HMRC form P55. This can be submitted online or by post.

I spoke to HMRC and someone agreed to contact you. After this you both decided it would be simplest to reimburse you on your next pension withdrawal.

You should be owed around £1,400, but this may vary depending on how much you withdraw.

You may also want to ask your pension adviser what they are doing to earn their money.

Straight to the point Vueling owes me £229 for return flights between Cardiff and Palma that were cancelled during the pandemic. I have tried to contact the airline to no avail. W. T., via email. I, too, had to chase Vueling repeatedly for a response. But a spokesman has assured me you have been refunded and it is investigating the reason for the delay. *** My wife accidentally filled up her car with the wrong fuel. I am a member of the RAC, so called to ask for advice and was put through to a firm called Fuel Doctor. Someone came out to drain the tank, but I had to pay £274.99, even though its website says its prices start from £120. F. D., Fife. After I contacted the RAC, a spokesman ran a price check and says you would have saved only £50 by contacting Fuel Doctor directly. They added that you would have missed out on extra services, such as a free tow.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fleetwood Mac singer and keyboardist Christine McVie has become the fourth member of the legendary rock band to sell their back catalogue.

The Lancashire-born musician, 78, has sold her rights to future royalties from 115 songs to music IP investment company Hipgnosis, which also bought the back catalogue of the band's guitarist Lindsey Buckingham earlier this year.

Back in January, drummer Mick Fleetwood sold his publishing rights to music giant BMG, while fellow singer Stevie Nicks earned an estimated $80million to $100million from selling an 80 per cent share of her back catalogue in late 2020.

Songstress: McVie joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970 and has been behind some of the group's biggest-selling hits, including Don't Stop and You Make Loving Fun and Little Lies

It means bassist John McVie, Christine's former husband, is the only longtime member of the group to have not sold his publishing rights, though he has written few of the band's songs.

Hipgnosis co-founder Merck Mercuriadis said Christine McVie 'is one of the greatest songwriters of all time, having guided Fleetwood Mac to almost 150 million albums sold and making them one of the best-selling bands of all time globally.'

After a spell with blues band Chicken Shack, McVie joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970 and has been behind some of the group's biggest-selling hits, including Don't Stop, You Make Loving Fun and Little Lies.

The first two hits appeared on the Rumours album, one of the most famous music albums in history with over 45 million copies sold worldwide, while the latter appeared on Tango on the Night, which has sold 15 million copies.

McVie has also won two Grammy Awards, an Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 along with the rest of her bandmates.

The same year, she began a long hiatus from the band and lived - largely out of the limelight - in a small village in Kent before rejoining the group in 2014 for its On with the Show tour.

Dreams: Music fans have bought more than 150 million of Fleetwood's albums since its founding in 1967 by Mick Fleetwood (far right) and Peter Green, who died in July 2020

Mercuriadis, a former Elton John manager who co-founded Hipgnosis with Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers, noted that of the 16 songs on the band's Greatest Hits album, McVie - born Christine Perfect - had composed half of them.

He added: 'It's wonderful for us to welcome Christine to the Hipgnosis Family and particularly wonderful to reunite her once again at Hipgnosis with Lindsey Buckingham.'

Music fans have bought more than 150 million of Fleetwood Mac's albums since its founding in 1967 by Mick Fleetwood and Peter Green, who died in July 2020.

McVie's future husband John joined the band a few weeks after its first concert.

Fleetwood Mac's other major hits have included Go Your Own Way, Dreams, Tusk and The Chain. The latter has become well known in the UK for being the theme tune to television coverage of Formula One racing.

Song buyers: Nile Rodgers (left) and Merck Mercuriadis (right) are the founders of Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which owns the rights to songs by artists such as Shakira and Debbie Harry

McVie expressed elation with the sale, stating that she was 'thrilled that you all regard my songs worthy of merit. I'd like to thank you all for your faith in me, and I'll do all I can to continue this new relationship and help in any way I can!'

Hipgnosis did not reveal how much it spent purchasing McVie's rights, but the firm has raised over £1billion to buy the back catalogues of major artists such as Debbie Harry, Shakira, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

The large number of back catalogues acquired in recent years has been compared to a music gold rush, as investors spend ample sums grabbing the rights to music royalties that they hope will provide a stable long-term source of income thanks to streaming.

It can also be a way for musicians to earn one last big payday. Bob Dylan scored an estimated $300million when he sold his back catalogue of 600 songs, including Blowin' in the Wind and Knockin' on Heaven's Door, to Universal Music Group.

Dolly Parton and Ozzy Osbourne are considering selling their back catalogues, while Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher has said he could sell his for as much as £200million and use some of that money to buy a superyacht.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@White collar workers are increasingly returning to their London offices, two UK property firms said yesterday.

Office space provider IWG reported a ‘very strong recovery’ and said occupancy rates were bouncing back after coronavirus restrictions lifted.

And Derwent, a London-focused landlord, placed a fresh £200million bet on the city’s property market as it predicted that demand for high-quality space would continue.

Office workers arrive at Victoria Station in London. Flexible office space provider IWG reported a ‘very strong recovery’ and said occupancy rates in the capital were bouncing back

It has bought two buildings in the ‘knowledge quarter’ in Euston Road and Tottenham Court Road, where many life science organisations are based.

But both firms think hybrid working will continue, with staff coming into work two or three days per week.

WFH threat to the young Younger office workers will struggle to climb the corporate ladder if they don’t return to the office, a top asset manager claims. Stephen Bird, whose company has changed its name from Standard Life Aberdeen to ‘Abrdn’, said staff would not be noticed, echoing Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s comments last week. Firms are deciding whether or not to bring staff back five days a week. Bird said: ‘I don’t think I would’ve been noticed on Zoom. I was very fortunate to be able to come in and see other people operating and emulate some of their behaviour’. Abrdn posted a 77 per cent jump in first-half profits to £163million. Rival M&G said it had swung to a £248million half-year loss, from a £826million profit.

Despite this, Derwent boss Paul Williams predicted a ‘war for space’, claiming tenants wanted ‘the right space, not just the cheapest space’.

Derwent said rental income in the first half of 2021 rose from £84.4million to £90.1million, with office rent collection rates for the June quarter at 95 per cent.

The value of its portfolio fell from £5.4billion to £5.38billion, compared to a year earlier. Shares rose 1.6 per cent, or 61p, to 3772p.

Meanwhile, IWG is seeking to capitalise on the shift to flexible working by opening new branches outside London. The company, formerly known as Regus, said it added more than 900 business customers in the first half of 2021.

Boss and founder Mark Dixon said: ‘This fundamental shift in the way people work is clearly a positive tailwind and we are seeing increasing levels of interest from enterprises wishing to transform their working practices.’

But revenues still took a hit, falling 19.3 per cent to £1.1billion in the six months to June 30.

Losses narrowed from £237.8million to £191.9million. Its occupancy rate was 66.2 per cent, down from 73.4 per cent a year earlier. Shares rose 2.7 per cent, or 8.6p, to 328p.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain’s companies offer some great opportunities at the moment despite Brexit, but investors should look further down the ladder than the FTSE 100 big guns.

That’s the view of Colin McLean, co-manager of the SVM UK Growth fund, who says that he is backing British firms with good profit margins, solid business plans and something special in their product or service.

This gives the ability to reinvest their cash to grow for years to come, whereas the Footsie’s big international companies are less in control of their own destiny.

Colin joins us on the latest Investing Show to discuss where he sees the winners in the UK stock market.

He explains why he has been backing Ocado for years and stuck with through the tough times as investors waited patiently for the deal that would finally deliver on its promise to turn be a tech company and not just an online supermarket.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An army of enforcers will start knocking on the doors of thousands of vulnerable pensioners from next month demanding they pay £159 for their previously free TV licence – or face the ultimate threat of jail.

Masquerading as 'customer care' personnel, they are on a mission to track down more than a quarter of a million over-75s who have yet to pay for their TV licence.

Once they get their foot in the door, they will order pensioners to pay up. Failure to pay the bill could lead to prosecution, a £1,000 fine and prison if payment is not forthcoming.

These looming doorstep attacks follow the scrapping of the free TV licence for over-75s by the BBC last August.

Many pensioners, who haven't paid for their TV licence, will be contacted by debt enforcers

Despite the fact that nine out of ten of the four million pensioners have already paid for a licence, 260,000 are standing firm. Many of them are vulnerable, live alone and are surviving on incomes of less than £180 a week.

Some are furious that their right to a free licence has been taken away without any proper consultation while others simply cannot afford to pay.

By law, a licence is required to watch any TV live on any channel.

Retired bookmaker Colin James, 82, from Wolverhampton, is furious that he has been asked to pay for his TV licence.

On Friday, he told The Mail on Sunday: 'The BBC is giving us a load of old codswallop about how it needs our money – while frittering away a fortune on obscene salaries that those who fund it can only ever dream of.'

He added: 'Having paid for a TV licence my whole life with the promise of it being free in old age, the BBC has suddenly changed the goal posts. Does it have a magic switch to turn my TV off? It can bully all it wants, it can send round the heavies, but I'm not paying.'

The total amount the BBC could potentially receive from the 260,000 targeted victims adds up to just over £40million.

This is equivalent to the cost of 52 BBC presenters currently earning more than £150,000 a year – plus the salaries of as many as 100 'senior leaders'.

Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is the highest paid – earning £1.36million a year, and this is after a £390,000 pay cut.

The BBC already enjoys annual revenue of more than £3.5billion from TV licences. Further income from media sales tops this up to almost £5billion.

The decision to start knocking on the doors of pensioners follows a series of 'please act now before your licence is cancelled' and 'gentle reminder' letters sent out in recent weeks. But the letters also forewarn of enforcement officers arriving if they fail to pay.

Threat: TV Licensing's letter warning debt collectors will be called in if the fee is not paid

Retired 82-year-old printer Johnnie Carslake, from Norfolk, says: 'The BBC can take me to court – and get me thrown into jail. I am making a stand and refuse to pay the fee. We had a legal deal for a free licence that the BBC has now broken.'

Jan Shortt, general secretary of campaign group National Pensioners Convention, points out that it is not just a broken promise leading many people to refuse to pay. Some 60,000 pensioners, she says, do not have the cash.

Shortt warns: 'Many people have a hard decision to make this year – whether they turn on their heating or pay for a TV licence. For many vulnerable people, the television provides comfort and company.

'We estimate at least 60,000 are surviving on perhaps £180 a week or less and are just above the threshold that would allow them to claim Pension Credit – and be eligible for a free TV licence.

'With soaring heating bills and rising council taxes, people will be forced to decide if they can still afford this basic luxury or must forgo their TV to keep their home warm.'

She adds: 'We would never encourage people to break the law, but we can fully understand the decision made by those that are refusing to pay. We respect the stance they are taking.'

An estimated 1.5million households are eligible for a free TV licence because they receive Pension Credit – but only about 800,000 people have applied.

Costly: Many pensioners will not be able to afford the TV licence, experts have said

If you are above State pension age and earn less than £173.75 a week as a single person, or £265.20 a week as a couple, then Pension Credit will top your income up to these levels.

Terry Clohosy, a retired tool maker from Essex, only received a free TV licence for six months before the BBC decided to take it away from him.

The married 77-year-old says: 'I have been getting a letter every month for the last year demanding I pay up. Then this month I received a letter adopting a more softly-softly approach.

'That was until the end of the letter when it stated that if it had not heard from me by August, "your address will be passed on to Romford Enforcement Division for investigation".

'It is disgraceful behaviour. If my mother – who died a few years ago in her 90s – had received such a letter, she would have been reduced to tears.'

The Mail on Sunday visited the swanky £1billion renovated offices of Broadcasting House in Central London last September, armed with hundreds of readers' letters complaining about the scrapping of the free over-75s licence.

We asked the BBC for a meeting with the new £525,000-a-year Director-General Tim Davie so we could hand over the correspondence.

We also wanted to make it clear that there was a growing rebellion among many pensioners refusing to pay – and that it could end up with the BBC spending vast sums of money on debt collectors to collect the fees. Our request was ignored.

The BBC is cloaking its attack on pensioners with phrases such as 'customer care visits' and is promising that there will be no 'record of interview' – meaning there will not be a prosecution if someone initially fails to pay the fee.

It also claims it will use 'members of staff who are specially trained in assisting older customers' to visit pensioners.

But the fact remains that a failure to toe the line and hand over the £159 will ultimately end in prosecution. Incidentally, no one is obliged to let the debt collectors into their homes.

On Friday, the BBC told The Mail on Sunday: 'Now that the transition period is over, our focus is to continue to support everyone to become correctly licensed.

'We appreciate some of the small group who have not yet made arrangements may have concerns about being able to pay, which is why we have written to them and will shortly be undertaking customer care visits, carried out by specially trained staff.

'There are a range of payment options to help with this, including options to spread the cost.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@People saving for later life are missing out on 'better retirements' because institutional investors focus too heavily on the returns from stock market listed companies, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have warned.

In an open letter, Johnson and Sunak called on pension funds and other major investors to back entrepreneurial British companies that need money to grow.

Pension funds hold billions of pounds for their members, but 80 per cent of their money is in listed securities, namely shares traded on the London Stock Exchange.

Yet, listed securities only make up 20 per cent of UK assets, Johnson and Sunak said.

Open letter: Sunak and Johnson have written an open letter to Britain's institutional investors

The duo have asked big institutional investors to consider long-term investments in UK assets to help the economy rebound following the pandemic.

They cited Canadian and Australian pension funds as examples of how to move forward.

The aim is to ignite an investment 'big bang' that could potentially unlock the hundreds of billions of pounds sitting in UK institutions.

Johnson and Sunak said in the letter: 'We recognise the responsibility of the Government to remove obstacles and costs to making long-term, illiquid investments in the UK.

'The Government is doing everything possible – short of mandating more investment in these areas as some have advocated – to encourage a change in mindset and behaviour among institutional investors, and we remain open to addressing further barriers where they are identified.

'UK institutional investors are under-represented in owning UK assets.

'We are challenging you this summer to begin to invest more in long-term UK assets, giving pension savers access to better returns and enabling them to see their funds support an innovative, healthier, greener future for their country.

'We know that this will require a change in mindset for many investors that won't happen overnight, but that is why this change needs to start now.'

Investors can make high returns on their money by putting cash into start-up companies and other innovators in the economy that are not listed on a public exchange.

Missing out: Britons' retirements are suffering due to pension funds focusing too much on stock market listed firms, Johnson and Sunak warned

But, these type of investments can often be difficult to sell on.

Back in 2019, the Woodford Equity Income Fund, run by fund manager Neil Woodford, had to be suspended after Mr Woodford invested too much of the fund's money in illiquid assets.

Woodford allowed his clients to take their cash out of the fund whenever they wanted, but he was unable to honour this largely because much of the money was tied up in these hard-to-sell assets.

However, pension funds do not allow their members to withdraw cash at any time, which provides more protection against the kind of surge in withdrawals which troubled the Woodford fund.

Johnson and Sunak said that ministers would explain more about their plans in the coming weeks.

They added: 'We need an investment big bang, to unlock the hundreds of billions of pounds sitting in UK institutional investors and use it to drive the UK's recovery.'

But, John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant, said: 'This is 90 per cent hot air from the Prime Minister.

'Defined benefit pension schemes need assets that generate a guaranteed inflation linked return to pay guaranteed pensions. Most of the things the PM is banging the drum for don't do this.

'For defined contribution auto-enrolment pensions investments should be as transparent as possible and as cheap as possible. Again, most of the things being pushed here don't do this.'

The Daily Mail's City Editor, Alex Brummer, believes Johnson and Sunak need to go further to help push British businesses forward.

He said: 'They could have told the so-called UK long funds that instead of capitulating at the first sound of gunfire from private equity and other predators – as is the case at Morrisons, aerospace innovators Meggitt et al – they should tell financially driven bidders to get lost.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ministers were yesterday under pressure to pay compensation to Football Index victims

Ministers were yesterday under pressure to pay compensation to Football Index victims following claims the Government-backed regulator failed to protect customers.

The betting website, which styled itself as a 'stock market for footballers', went bust in March leaving fans with £90 million of open bets.

The Gambling Commission was accused of being 'asleep at the wheel' after it admitted the collapse followed a ten-month probe. Its actions are being investigated by an independent review expected to report next month.

Football Index customers have hired lawyers and want the Government to compensate them.

Matt Zarb-Cousin, director of Clean Up Gambling who supports the victims, said: 'If the inquiry finds the commission culpable, then unless Football Index users are compensated by the Government they will have been treated as collateral damage.'

Andrew Rhodes, boss of the Gambling Commission, said that it could not be blamed for the collapse as 'being regulated does not prevent a company going into administration.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The first commercial wind farm started up nearly half a century ago in 1975 in the US. Yet – despite all the noise about renewable power – wind and solar still made up less than 3 per cent of global energy supply before the pandemic.

About 80 per cent of the rest comes from 'dirty' fossil fuels – oil, gas and coal – and the percentage has changed little since the 1970s.

With governments around the world targeting net zero carbon emissions by 2050 something has to change. Much of the focus is still on wind and solar, topped up with hydropower, but there is another strong player in the clean energy game – hydrogen.

High ambition: HydrogenOne Capital will invest in hydrogen to provide clean fuel for planes, ships and trains

Hydrogen has been used for years to power industrial processes from steel manufacture to oil refining.

Made from fossil fuels, it is known as 'grey' hydrogen and the market exceeds £120billion a year. But grey hydrogen produces lots of greenhouse gases – 830million tons annually, roughly twice the UK's total annual emissions.

Now, however, new methods are being developed to create hydrogen without polluting the planet.

Blue hydrogen follows the same process as grey but the carbon is captured and stored. Green hydrogen is made from water, using wind or solar-powered electricity and new ideas are in development, including hydrogen made from waste.

The potential for this 'clean' hydrogen is immense. It can replace grey hydrogen in industrial processes. It can dispense with the need for diesel generators and it can power trains, buses and lorries – even planes and ships.

Overall, clean hydrogen is expected to contribute to 10 per cent of global energy over time, with demand predicted to grow 20- fold in the next decade alone. But this coming power source needs cash, with hundreds of companies and projects in the field looking for capital to expand and develop.

HydrogenOne Capital has been set up to meet that need and provide shareholders with juicy returns along the way.

The company intends to list on the stock market at the end of this month, offering shares at £1 apiece and hoping to raise £250million, with further expansion likely in the coming years.

Shares can be applied for via intermediaries such as AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown and Interactive Investor or directly via the flotation prospectus on HydrogenOne's website.

Some 36 potential investments have already been identified and the group expects to have invested all the cash raised in the forthcoming listing within 12 to 18 months.

To provide as much variety as possible, HydrogenOne is looking at opportunities worldwide and intends to buy stakes in listed firms, established private businesses and even individual projects. The first listed fund dedicated to clean energy,

HydrogenOne is run by two energy industry veterans, JJ Traynor and Richard Hulf, who have amassed more than 60 years' experience between them, advising and working for oil and gas majors such as BP, Shell and Exxon.

Traynor has a PhD in geology from Cambridge University and Hulf has an MSc in petroleum engineering from Imperial College so they combine academic expertise with industry nous and, over the decades, have built an enviable network of contacts.

Today, Traynor and Hulf are not only keen to make the world greener. They also want to make money and are targeting annual growth of 10 per cent to 15 per cent, from 2023.

Regular dividends are not expected but there may be one-off payouts down the line, as investments are sold.

Primarily however, HydrogenOne is focused on capital appreciation – buying businesses, helping them expand and seeing that expansion reflected in the share price.

Encouragingly for individual investors, Ineos, the chemicals giant, has agreed to buy shares worth £25million in the flotation, hoping to use increasing amounts of blue and green hydrogen to reduce its own carbon footprint.

Midas verdict: Clean hydrogen is one of the fastest-growing sectors within the green energy market and is expected to be worth at least £600billion by 2040. Traynor and Hulf are starting small but they hope to scale up rapidly, providing much needed capital to small and mid-sized businesses and delivering returns for investors too.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Thousands of NS&I savers have been offered the chance to cash in their fixed-rate bonds early, penalty-free.

Treasury-backed NS&I had to write to savers after failing to tell them changes to the terms and conditions of its Guaranteed Growth Bonds in 2019 could mean a big tax bill.

The bonds are no longer on general sale, but those who already hold them can roll them over into a new bond running for between one and five years.

Muddle: NS&I admits 'it could have been clearer' in explaining the bonds' tax treatment

Before May 2019 savers could access their money early if they paid a fee equivalent to 90 days' interest. Any tax owed on interest added to their accounts would be paid each year. But a rule change two years ago meant savers buying or renewing their bonds could no longer access their money early — altering when the interest is taxed.

On bonds bought from May 1, 2019, although interest is credited to an account annually, it is not taxable until the bond matures. This can mean some savers are in danger of breaching their annual personal savings allowance of £1,000 for basic-rate taxpayers and £500 for higher-rate payers.

Tax is due on any savings interest earned above these amounts. Additional-rate payers get no allowance.

A three-year bond taken out in May 2019 pays 1.95 per cent before tax — £597 for each £10,000 investment. With all the interest lumped in one tax year, higher-rate earners will bust their £500 personal savings allowance in the April 2022/April 2023 tax year.

Basic-rate taxpayers face a bill if interest earned on savings elsewhere outside an Isa is more than £403 in that tax year. And those who hold £20,000 in the bond will earn more than their £1,000 savings allowance.

On the five-year bond at 2.25 per cent, savers will see £1,177 interest on each £10,000 at the end of the term. Yet it took NS&I four months after the May 2019 rule change to tell savers how they would be taxed. Many only became aware of the changes in April this year when the tax risk was spelled out in their annual statements.

NS&I admits 'it could have been clearer' in explaining the bonds' tax treatment.

It has since given 14,400 customers who renewed their Guaranteed Growth Bonds between May 2019 and September 2019 the chance to cash them in without penalty. But they had just 30 days to make up their mind after the NS&I letter was sent on June 15. Savers who failed to reply in that time missed the boat and could face a tax bill.

Taking cash is not always the right option, as lower rates elsewhere could mean basic-rate taxpayers are better off in the bonds.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britons resumed borrowing and started saving less last month as the lifting of social restrictions prompted consumers to reach for their wallets.

For the first time since August last year, consumers borrowed more than they paid off in May, with unsecured lending rising by a net £280million from April, the latest figures by the Bank of England show.

While borrowing on credit cards remained weak, people took out more personal loans and bought cars on dealership finance deals, according to the report. Credit card net repayments totalled £101million, but there was a £381million increase in 'other' forms of consumer credit.

Consumer spending trends: The lifting of social restrictions prompted consumers to reach for their wallets in May, when pubs and restaurants were allowed to fully reopen

Meanwhile, savings are falling back, as although households are still building up their bank account, they're doing so at a slower pace than earlier in the year.

Britons deposited an additional £7billion with banks and building societies in May, bringing the total deposited since the star of the pandemic at the end of March to £200billion.

But May's figure is down from £10.7billion in the previous month, more than half the average of £16.5billion in the six months to April and below the record high of £27.6billion in May last year, when the first lockdown triggered involuntary saving.

However, it still remains above pre-pandemic levels, as the average inflow of savings in the year to February 2020 was lower at £4.7billion.

On 17 May, hospitality and leisure businesses were allowed to fully open, which partially explains last month's slowdown in savings and increase in borrowing.

'After a long period of hibernation, it’s natural consumers are enjoying a bit of the old normal, and many have built up a sizeable war chest of savings over the course of the pandemic,' said Laith Khalaf, a financial analyst at AJ Bell.

'Unfortunately those savings are earning next to nothing in the bank, and now inflation is on the rise, they’re actually losing their buying power more quickly.'

Splashing on a new car: The increase in borrowing reflects an increase in 'other' forms of consumer credit, like personal loans and car dealership finance, the Bank of England said

The Bank of England said the effective interest rate paid on new fixed-rate accounts decreased to an average 0.33 per cent, a new record low.

The average instant access account is also still paying just 0.1 per cent, according to the data.

Meanwhile, inflation rose to 2.1 per cent last month, and the Bank now expects it to rise above 3 per cent later this year, which will eat further into savings.

At present the best easy-access account pays only 0.5 per cent interest whilst the best one fixed rate account pays 1.01 per cent – neither gets anywhere close to keeping up with the current rate of inflation.

Resuming borrowing: For the first time since August last year, consumers borrowed more than they paid off in May

Mortgage approvals remain high

Mortgage approvals increased slightly in May to 87,500, having dropped in April, according to the Bank of England report.

They have fallen from a recent peak of 103,200 in November, but remain above pre-February 2020 levels.

They are also up 827 per cent compared to May last year, when the property market came to a standstill due to the pandemic.

Net mortgage borrowing rebounded to £6.6bilion in May, from £3billion in April, having hit a record £11.4billion in March.

Analysts say the announcement of the extension of the stamp duty helped mortgage borrowing bounce back last month.

'It looks like the extension of the stamp duty holiday has had the desired effect, helping to stabilize mortgage demand after several months of falling approvals since the peak in November of last year,' Khalaf said.

'While stamp duty relief clearly boosted housing transactions, so did pent up demand from all the purchases that couldn’t happen in spring of last year.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Cyber security firm Avast has been sold to American rival Norton in a £6.2billion deal.

The London-listed company, which is based in Prague, revealed it was in merger talks last month.

A deal has now been done with Norton, which intends to pay with cash and shares. The merger will create a cyber security giant with annual revenues of £2.5billion and more than 500m customers.

Tech merger: Avast has been sold to American rival Norton in a £6.2bn deal which will create a cyber security giant with annual revenues of £2.5bn and more than 500m customers

Vincent Pilette, chief executive of Norton, said his company was strong in identity theft protection whereas Avast was strong in privacy. He added: 'We both have the vision of a common platform.'

Avast shares rose 3.1 per cent, or 17.6p, to 586p. Founded in the Czech Republic, its 'freemium' software, offers basic services for free, and sophisticated ones for a price.

It had 435m active users at the end of 2020, of whom 16.5m were paying. Norton, previously known as Symantec, has a larger premium business which sells software to combat viruses, spyware, malware and other attacks.

After the merger, likely to complete in 12 months, Avast shareholders are expected to hold 14 to 26 per cent of the company.

This will depend on whether they choose to be paid in cash or shares.

The companies plan to slash shared costs, notably by cutting staff from 5,000 to 4,000, and will also aim to wring out £202million of other savings. There will be two HQs – in Prague and, Arizona.

Analysts at Jefferies said the deal 'looks strategically sensible… but investors are unlikely to feel the offer is particularly generous'.

Shareholders who choose to be paid mainly in cash will see their Avast shares valued at about 608.4p.

Those who choose mostly Norton stock will see their Avast shares valued at about 551p.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@We've all been there. It's late at night on a 'smart' motorway with relatively little traffic. No visible sign of any problem. But approaching the next overhead gantry, you notice the speed limit is showing 40 mph.

So you slow down, fearing trouble ahead. Yet for mile after mile there's nothing. No accident. No roadworks. No incident. Other drivers are becoming frustrated and beginning to put their foot down.

Soon, massive juggernauts are trundling inches from your rear bumper or overtaking at speed as you stick to the 40 mph limit. Yet it feels increasingly unsafe to do so.

Safety concerns: 'Smart' motorways constantly monitor traffic and automatically reduce speed limits to avoid localised jams and shut down lanes in the event of an accident

It is truly scary. I have been in that situation more than once. Motoring organisations the AA and RAC are aware of it, too. It's just one of their list of concerns about so-called 'smart' motorways.

RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: 'Smart motorway signage is not always being switched off after incidents have been cleared, resulting in some drivers sticking to previous 40 mph limits, while others are rocketing past at 70 mph. Drivers need to be able to trust the motorway signs.'

Anyone who has been on the M4 motorway in recent years will also know the frustration at the seemingly never-ending 50 mph speed limit — policed by average-speed cameras — as it is upgraded to 'smart' motorway status.

The AA and RAC say aspects of digital motorways are simply 'not so smart'.

Delays: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is still sitting on several key evaluation reports on smart motorway safety

MPs on the Commons Transport Committee have even delayed their report into smart motorway safety until early autumn because key evidence from unpublished Highways England safety evaluation reports is still sitting with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.

So what exactly are smart motorways and why are they causing concern?

Transport ministers want cost-effective ways to increase road capacity — getting more vehicles flowing more freely and safely on the same amount of road.

Their high-tech solution was the 'smart' motorway — constantly monitoring traffic and automatically reducing speed limits to avoid localised jams and shut down lanes in the event of an accident.

Overhead gantries and large roadside information signs warn of queues, speed limits, closed lanes and diversions.

To ensure compliance, advanced speed cameras with number-plate recognition police the system with the threat of fines and penalty points on the licence.

An early version with variable speed limits started on the M25 in 1995, with a pilot smart motorway on the M42 in 2006.

The programme accelerated from 2014 with the first All Lane Running (with no hard shoulder and variable speed limits).

However, the decision to take over the hard shoulder at peak times or remove it altogether has become a controversial element that has been blamed for a number of fatalities.

AA president Edmund King said: 'The danger of breaking down in a live lane comes when you can't get to a refuge area. Some 38 per cent of breakdowns occur in a live lane on a smart motorway.'

A section of the M3 smart motorway near Camberley in Surrey. The motorways have no hard shoulder for emergencies, and use technology to close off lanes

The long distances between these areas is 'a fundamental flaw' in 'smart' motorway design, he says.

Only after pressure from the AA did the Government pledge to place the refuges no more than one mile apart, but the existing network still has them spaced 1.5 miles apart.

Average spacing is 1.2 miles — or 72 seconds at 60 mph — which is a challenge if your car has given up the ghost.

Highways England says it will 'continue to consider' retrofitting extra emergency areas on existing smart motorways where they are more than one mile apart, with a decision to be made by April next year.

One catalyst for change was the death in 2018 of Nargis Begum, 62, from Sheffield, who was killed after her car broke down on a section of the M1 with no hard shoulder.

All you need to know There are three different types of smart motorway: Controlled motorways have three or more lanes, variable speed limits and a hard shoulder for emergency use only.

Dynamic hard shoulder (DHS) motorways have variable speed limits and a hard shoulder that can be opened up to traffic at busy times when overhead signs tell you that it is allowed.

All Lane Running motorways have variable speed limits, no hard shoulder and an emergency refuge area roughly every 1.5 miles or every mile. Overhead signs show a red X if a lane is closed — and you now face a fine and penalty points if you ignore it.

Hearings heard that 16 minutes elapsed between her Nissan breaking down and the crash near Woodall services. It took a further six minutes before warning signs were activated.

In February this year, the coroner said Highways England should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for potential manslaughter charges, though the government-owned company denied having committed any offence.

Mr King said: 'In the pre-inquest hearing into the M1 fatality of Mrs Begum, the coroner was informed that between seven and eight staff in the regional control centre would watch over 450 CCTV cameras for the Yorkshire and North East region, of which 287 CCTV cameras specifically overlook the 'smart' motorway sections. This means staff are looking across more than 55 cameras each.'

That is changing, says Highways England, which is committed by September 2022 to retrofitting radar Stationary Vehicle Detection (SVD) systems to all existing All Lane Running motorway. Every new smart motorway will have radar SVD technology in place upon opening.

By September of next year, Highways England says it will also upgrade its enforcement cameras to automatically detect vehicles passing illegally under a red X or entering the lane beyond one, where drivers face fines and penalty points.

Although smart motorways are designed to reduce congestion, a third of drivers don't use the inside lane because they are worried about breakdowns ahead, and so capacity is reduced.

Public confidence in using smart motorways is at an all-time low, says the AA, with its own polling showing more than half (56 per cent) of drivers saying the smart motorways project should be scrapped and the hard shoulder reinstated.

The AA wants the Government to convert all motorways to 'controlled' motorways (with a hard shoulder and overhead gantries), where it says the fatality rate is 'significantly lower'.

Highways England says: 'We recognise that fears have continued to be raised about smart motorways and, in particular, the impact that removing the hard shoulder has on driver safety. So we are taking action, and also accelerating measures to help road users feel safer on them.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anthony Scaramucci is best known for his brief but memorable role as President Trump's director of communications, but he has also had a much longer and equally as colourful career in the investment industry.

'The Mooch', as he became known during his 11-day stint at the White House, worked at Goldman Sachs in the 1980s and 1990s, but then went on to found Oscar Capital Management and later the investment firm SkyBridge Capital.

In a new interview, Scaramucci fondly remembers his investment in a tequila brand: 'I think I was 15 to one on that investment. We put it in the HBO show Entourage, it caught fire, and then we sold it to the French spirits company Bernard, I think it was called. That was an incredible investment.'

But with the benefit of hindsight and significantly more humility, Scaramucci also now recalls at the height of his 'investment arrogance' one of his worst investments to date among a 'series of losers' that all investors will suffer.

Anthony Scaramucci reveals his worst investment came during his time at Goldman Sachs at the 'height of [his] investment arrogance'

'I was 27, and for some reason, I decided that I knew more about biotechnology than biotechnology people or scientists or medical doctors. I obviously know everything.

'And so, I had the worst thing that can happen to you, I bought these call options on a biotech company. And they exploded to the upside,' he told Interactive Investor's Family Money show.

That meant that Scaramucci was initially well up on his investment, but then disaster struck.

He said: 'So that fortified me with great confidence about what a genius I was. And so, I doubled down, as this company was moving from phase two to phase three approval for the FDA [US drugs regulator] and they didn't get the approval.

Unfortunately, I didn't even understand – this is how arrogant and stupid I was – how the leverage worked in my personal account

'I had all these call options that were levered in my account. Unfortunately, I didn't even understand – this is how arrogant and stupid I was – how the leverage worked in my personal account.

'And so, the margin desk called me at Goldman Sachs and told me: 'You're in the hole by $50,000.' And let me tell you something, at that time in my life, we're at $150,000 of school debt. I really couldn't afford it.

'I went to go see my boss… and I explained to him what I did. And he looked at me and said, 'Man, you are as stupid as stupid could be. And hopefully you learned your lesson that the markets know more than you do.'

Whether Scaramucci has learned the importance of specialist knowledge remains to be seen.

Earlier this year, at the peak of the crypto rally, Scaramucci's firm SkyBridge, a fund of hedge funds, announced it had started a bitcoin fund.

'Bitcoin is better at being gold than gold is at being gold,' he said at the time. 'It's easier to store, it's harder to steal, it's more portable, and so therefore, it's become the ledger or the storage of the future in terms of the storage of value.'

Since then the bitcoin price has tumbled from about $60,000 to as low as just under $30,000, although it has since bounced back to the $45,000 mark.

Scaramucci has developed an uncharacteristic self-awareness of both his investments and his time on Trump's presidential campaign and later in the White House.

'Donald Trump was not even choice number one or two. But when he called to recruit me, that's where the ego kicked in. And, you know, you do a lot of regrettable things based on your ego,' he told Gabby Logan on ii's podcast.

'Being fired from the White House was a huge disappointment. It turned out to be a blessing – I didn't know that at the time. But it was a huge disappointment.'

Donald Trump... when he called to recruit me, that's where the ego kicked in

The Mooch was forced out of the White House after calling a reporter to give a profanity-laced rant against his own colleagues.

His main lesson from this ill-fated experience has been one of both humility and toughness: 'I'm more humble. I think it's made me more psychologically minded. I think I have a lot more empathy for people that go through things.

He added: 'When I got blown out of the White House, a lot of people would have rolled on something like that, but I got up like a crash dummy and just dusted myself off and went back to work.

'It was a week after I got fired. I was walking with him [his son AJ] in Santa Monica, on the promenade, and he's like: 'Dad, jeez, are you OK?' And I'm like: 'Yeah, not only am I OK, watch what I do with this thing.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Technology is constantly being used to spy on us. It monitors how we drive, tracks our energy usage and even counts how many times we visit the gym.

But this can be good news. The information collected by 'smart' devices has the potential to substantially reduce annual household bills.

So-called 'snooper-tech' not only ensures our homes are energy efficient, but can reward us for keeping fit, driving sensibly and controlling our spending.

Cash watch: Technology that spies on you can be used to save you money

According to Alex Gunz, manager of investment fund Future Trends Equity at asset manager Heptagon Capital, such gadgets are now commonplace in British homes.

'Most consumers now reluctantly accept that they'll have to give up a bit of personal information in exchange for potential cost savings,' he says.

It's a trend he expects to continue with companies using this data to learn more about their customers and improve their products.

He adds: 'An increasing number of items in the home, whether it's the fridge or the lights, will in time be controlled remotely by a master device such as a mobile phone.'

Here are some key areas where snooper-tech can save you cash.

1. Car insurance

Agreeing to have a 'black box' installed in your car that reports back on your driving behaviour can help cut your motor insurance premiums.

These devices are fitted under the bonnet – or even stuck to the inside of the windscreen – and record everything you do behind the wheel.

This can include how far you're travelling, what time of day or night you're on the road, whether you stick to the speed limit, and if you are an erratic driver.

Crispin Moger, chief executive of insurance company Marmalade, says the devices are helping people understand how they can improve their driving skills. He says: 'With our black box insurance, customers can earn a safe driving discount on renewal of their policy of up to 25 per cent – on top of any standard no claims discount.'

2. Energy bills

Smart thermostats can give you better control over your heating – and energy bills, according to Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown.

'Some thermostats use geolocation technology to spot if you've left home and remind you to turn the heating off,' she says. 'Others track your heating use and then heat your home accordingly.'

Smart meters show how you're burning through energy – and what needs to change to reduce your usage.

'The reality is these meters have had teething problems and earlier versions just weren't smart enough,' adds Coles. 'Yet newer versions promise to live up to their smart billing.'

Octopus Energy says: 'By combining a smart energy tariff, a smart meter and smart home products, homeowners can save substantial amounts of money on their energy bills by setting appliances – such as an electric car home charger – to run at greener and cheaper times.'

3. Life insurance

Your smartwatch or fitness tracker can now do a lot more than simply count your steps or show your latest text messages.

Some insurance companies are incentivising customers with attractive offers for wearing one, according to Jo Thornhill, money expert at comparison website MoneySupermarket.

'The information from trackers gives providers an indication of how well the customer takes care of themselves,' she explains.

For example, Vitality Insurance rewards active customers through lower increases in annual premiums on private healthcare policies or life cover.

It also introduced an Apple Watch benefit in 2016. Customers can buy the watch for a low upfront price with monthly repayments spread over three years.

But the repayments are reduced if the customer records significant activity on the watch, demonstrating a resolve to stay fit.

IT SAVES ME HUNDREDS A YEAR Neil Kinson, 52, embraced 'snooper-tech' after buying an electric car – and is now saving himself hundreds of pounds every year. The married father of two, who works in the software industry, began focusing on energy consumption after trading in his diesel Land Rover Discovery for a Jaguar I-Pace. His deal with Octopus Energy included getting an Ohme smart charger and access to a cheap overnight tariff. 'When I pull on to the drive, I plug the car in and the charger switches on during the cheapest energy period,' he says. 'I was spending £2,250 a year on diesel, but now the equivalent electricity costs are around £250.' The move inspired him to explore other smart tech at home in Wokingham, Berkshire, where he lives with Helen, 48, and children, Emma, 16, and 13-year-old James. He uses virtual assistant Alexa to switch the lights off in rooms that are not being used. He adds: 'The dishwasher has a timer so we set it after dinner to come on in the cheapest energy period. It's the same with the tumble dryer.'

4. In the kitchen

Some washing machines can be set to operate when energy tariffs are at their lowest, according to Craig Melson, head of digital devices, environment and sustainability, at trade association techUK.

He adds: 'Smart fridges can minimise food waste by alerting users to expiry dates and automatically order replenishments when items can be purchased at a competitive price.'

Sensors in these appliances can also detect and diagnose faults. Melson says: 'As well as the obvious safety benefits, householders will be able to tackle issues early before a fault results in an expensive repair or replacement.'

5. Leaking pipes

Technology can warn you of hidden dangers in the house. For example, a LeakBot sensor will constantly monitor for any pipe leaks – and then send an alert to the homeowner's smartphone if one is detected.

This device, which costs around £150, is clipped near your stopcock. Insurer Hiscox is among the first to offer a free LeakBot to those who take out its buildings insurance.

Finally, a smart power strip or smart plug can prevent household items left on standby – a television for example – quietly adding to energy bills.

Says Hargreaves' Coles: 'We know items left on standby and chargers that remain plugged in act like vampires, consuming energy while we sleep.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BHP, the world's biggest miner, has confirmed it is in talks to sell its oil business in a move that would mark its exit from the fossil fuels industry.

London and Sidney-listed BHP Group said it is in discussions to merge its oil and gas assets with those of Australia's Woodside Petroleum, potentially in exchange for shares.

The move would mark the latest step in the mining giant’s shift away from fossil fuels, having already sold some coal assets, to focus solely on its other mining operations.

BHP is a producer of iron ore, copper, petroleum, coal, nickel and potash

It comes as BHP and other large mining companies have been facing calls from shareholders and environmental pressure groups to reduce their exposure to fossil fuels.

BHP recently sold its stake in a joint venture which operated two coking coal mines, while it also offloaded its shale oil and gas fields in the US to BP for $10.5billion in 2018.

Chief executive Mike Henry has previously said the group will expand further into commodities which can be used for low-carbon power generation and look further towards higher quality raw materials.

'While discussions between the parties are currently progressing, no agreement has been reached on any such transaction,' BHP said today, adding that it was evaluating a number of options.

The group is a producer of iron ore, copper, petroleum, coal (both metallurgical and energy), nickel and potash. But analysts said iron ore and copper are 'the materials that really count'.

'Shareholder pressure is clearly building to sell or demerge the assets, but Mr Henry and the board have a tricky balancing act if they are to strike the right balance between shareholder satisfaction and shareholder value,' said AJ Bell investment director, Russ Mould.

'Management may simply feel that the pressure to act is too great and the alternatives – loss of value, loss of reputation and, in extremis, even loss of license to operate – are much bigger risks than missing out on any oil price recovery, especially as the oil and gas’ assets contribution to overall profitability is relative modest in the grand scheme of things (at least for the moment),' he added.

The potential sale comes as in the first half, BHP wrote down the value of its oil and gas assets by $1.6billion.

Tomorrow's results will reveal if there have been any further reassessments.

Analysts at Bernstein have estimated that the BHP division could be valued at around $13billion, or £9.4billion.

BHP shares were down 1.8 per cent to £22.80 just after London market close.

Asda was also bought out in a club deal by the Issa brothers and TDR Capital, while Cinven and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC bagged Miller Insurance Services.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@John Morgan is 65, an age at which many wealthy entrepreneurs start to think about retirement. Not Morgan. Still at the helm of Morgan Sindall, the construction group he founded in 1977, he shows little sign of slowing down.

Last week, Morgan told investors that results for 2021 were likely to be significantly ahead of expectations – the group's third upgrade this year. Interim figures are out on Wednesday, but the firm has revealed that pre-tax profit will be around £53million, some 46 per cent ahead of the comparable period in 2019, before Covid struck.

There is plenty of cash on the balance sheet and the firm has a secure workload valued at more than £8billion.

Brokers now expect that annual profits will almost double to £121million, while some analysts have pencilled in a near-40 per cent rise in this year's dividend to 85p.

Busy workload: Morgan Sindall consists of five divisions, ranging from long-term inner-city regeneration to half-day jobs

Some of the success reflects a rebound, following a tough start to 2020 but, as Morgan highlights, the business is doing well even compared to 2019. Encouragingly too, much of the strong performance stems from the company's particular culture and approach.

Morgan Sindall consists of five divisions, ranging from long-term inner-city regeneration to half-day jobs, such as repairing electrics at housing association properties. Straightforward construction is in there too, alongside big infrastructure projects, such as the Tideway Super Sewer in London and office and retail refits.

Thousands of jobs are completed each year. Morgan Sindall prides itself on paying subcontractors more promptly than rivals and on always trying to find better ways of working (such as creating a phone app that allows customers to track when a workman is coming to deal with a repair at their home).

This focus on fair deals for suppliers and clever deals for customers has helped Morgan Sindall to increase its market share steadily over the past few years – a trend the group expects to continue as the economy recovers.

Midas recommended Morgan Sindall in 2017 when the shares were £14.10. When we looked at the firm again, it was February 2020, pandemic jitters had already started and the stock had just fallen by 10 per cent to £17.54.

Last week, they closed at £23.40, with many followers expecting the price to move even higher over the next few months and beyond.

The group pays a decent dividend too, putting the stock on a yield of 3.6 per cent.

Midas verdict: At £23.40, Morgan Sindall shares have soared by 66 per cent in the past four years and are likely to trend higher in the months and years ahead. The business is well run and operating in an industry that is expected to continue expanding as the pandemic recedes. A strong hold.

The Express Yourself singer in fact adopted four of her children - David Banda, Mercy James, Stella and Estere - from the same country.

Madonna's eldest child is her 24-year-old daughter Lourdes Leon whom she shares with her former personal trainer Carlos Leon.

History: The global pop diva, who will be celebrating her 63rd birthday on Monday, has been linked since 2019 to Ahlamalik who is in his 20s

There was a flare-up of controversy when Madonna and Guy adopted David, owing in part to the fact the little boy's father Yohane was still alive.

Yohane publicly supported the adoption at the time telling The Guardian: 'My interest is in the child's best chance for health and education.'

He confessed: 'It was a hard choice to make, but when it seemed likely that David would have a better life with a new family, I could not say no.'

Yet as Madonna recalled in a People interview a few years ago: 'Every newspaper said I kidnapped him. In my mind, I was thinking: "Wait a minute. I’m trying to save somebody’s life. Why are you all s***ing on me right now?" I did everything by the book. That was a real low point for me. I would cry myself to sleep.'

Legging it: The Material Girl wore her signature blonde hair in pigtails and added a splash of glitz to her casual ensemble with multiple necklaces

Madonna and Guy had split up by the time of Mercy's adoption - and the Dick Tracy star has claimed the divorce led Malawian officials to question her parenting ability.

She ultimately swung the adoption by taking her case to Malawi's Supreme Court Of Appeal but: 'The way I was treated - that sexist behavior - was ridiculous.'

Stella and Estere's father gave an interview to The Mail On Sunday in 2017 expressing shock at the revelation they were being taken from him permanently.

‘I was told from the start that Esther and Stella were going to a rich woman’s home abroad, that she would give them a good education, then return them to me, to live with me and help all of my family,' said Adam Mwale.

Looking fab: Madonna and Ahlamalik could be spotted holding hands and gazing into one another's faces as they strolled through the airport

'Now you are telling me the adoption is permanent. That cannot be true – I don’t want it to be true. I am their father and I will always be their father.'

He maintained: ‘The orphanage boss told me it would be a wonderful chance for my little girls, and for their brother and sisters at home. I was told to agree with everything in court. I did not believe I would never see my girls again.'

The then 40-year-old farmer, who was living in the village of Kayembe, told The Mail On Sunday: 'I was standing with my brother-in-law who signed the consent forms with me, and we just continued to believe that I would always be the twins’ father and they would be coming home to me.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Robbie Williams has reflected on the mental health battles he faced at the height of his fame.

The singer, 47, discussed the struggles he faced with depression and anxiety after landing a spot in Take That at the age of 16.

Speaking to Chris Difford, 66, on his I Never Thought It Would Happen podcast, the 18-time Brit Award winner divulged into his own experiences with depression and anxiety with the Squeeze bandmember.

'I hated myself': Robbie Williams admitted he felt guilty for suffering with depression and anxiety after being given a 'golden ticket' into Take That

Robbie said he couldn't enjoy his career despite being given a 'golden ticket' at the age of 16 when he was chosen to be in the superstar band Take That.

He admitted: 'I couldn't jot down one nice thing about myself.

'I hated myself... the high bits [of my career] were married with a really, really dark depression and deep anxiety. And none of it was enjoyable.

'The fact that none of it was enjoyable made me deeply unhappy because I'd been given the golden ticket. This isn't an uncommon story.'

Troubled: Robbie said he couldn't enjoy his success in Take That due to his mental health struggles (pictured with Howard Donald, Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Jason Orange in 1991)

After notoriously exiting the five-piece in 1995, he thought he would be playing at Knebworth, where rival band Oasis had performed to a 250,000-strong crowd.

The issue was that the Staffordshire-born singer hadn't even written a song by that point.

Becoming visibly emotional, Robbie spoke of his overconfidence as he decided to embark on a solo career.

Despite wanting to be like Radiohead, Oasis and Blur, he described himself as more of a 'cabaret act' and couldn't help but be 'musical theatre'.

The Rock DJ hitmaker began dating actress Ayda Field, 42, in 2006 and they welcomed their first child, Theodora, eight, in 2012.

They are also proud parents to Beau, one, Colette (Coco), two, whom they welcomed via surrogate and son Charlton Valentine Williams, six.

And pregnant Malin Andersson has revealed she is expecting another girl with boyfriend Jared, and has told that the baby is due on same date as her late daughter Consy.

The former Love Island star, 28, hosted a gender reveal party over the weekend for 80 friends at her Cambridgeshire home, with a plane flying overhead releasing pink smoke to reveal that she is carrying a girl.

It's a girl! Malin Andersson, 28, has revealed she is expecting another girl with boyfriend Jared, and has told that the baby is due on same date as her late daughter Consy

Malin told OK! 'From the get-go I knew it was a girl, I had this gut feeling. So I was super happy. It just made sense to me.'

'Even though I knew what the gender was, because I went to the scan myself, when I saw the smoke it brought up loads of emotions.

'It made me feel really emotional. It confirmed it was real, in a weird way. It was like a little miracle and a blessing.

'To make it even more special, my new baby shares the same due date as my daughter Consy.'

Exciting: The former Love Island star, 28, is expecting a baby girl with boyfriend Jared

Last week, Malin shared a nude photo of herself in the bathtub as she wrote a passionate message about domestic abuse.

Malin explained how she was living through domestic abuse at the hands of her ex Tom Kemp when she was pregnant with her first child, who sadly passed away.

She wrote: 'It isn't until you are amongst peace that you realise what your life used to be like.

'Sometimes my life right now feels too good to be true. I don't like delving into my past unless it's to make a point & help you all to understand transition and strength - and this time I would like to compare how different my pregnancies are.

'Firstly, I have never been with anyone so loving and attentive.. that makes my soul shine and brings out only the best in me.

'I know this sounds so cringe as I write it - but when something so pure lands into your life, it almost feels alien if you've never experienced it before.

Radiant: Last week, Malin shared a nude photo of herself in the bathtub as she wrote a passionate message about domestic abuse

'My pregnancy so far has been stress free, calm and peaceful.. and a lot of that is down to me having a loving and stable relationship. One that has great communication and understanding - and most of all patience.

'I look back 3 years ago to when I was pregnant with Consy, and how volatile my relationship was then; and how I would wake up each day with severe anxiety, panic attacks and stress.

'With every argument and attack would come the tensing of my stomach and the knowing that my little girl could feel all the pain I felt too.

'It saddens me to think that I thought that was 'love' - and it breaks my heart knowing I let myself endure the emotional and physical pain whilst carrying something so precious - but this is what you call domestic abuse.'

Malin encouraged any of her followers who may be experiencing domestic abuse to go and seek help.

Candid: Malin explained how she was living through domestic abuse when she was pregnant with her first child Consy who tragically passed away at four weeks old in 2019

She wrote: 'Domestic abuse does not discriminate. If you are pregnant it can actually get worse.

'Domestic abuse during pregnancy puts a pregnant woman and her unborn child in danger. It increases the risk of miscarriage, infection, premature birth, low birth weight, foetal injury and foetal death.

'If you are pregnant and being abused, there is help. Your abusive partner is not only potentially endangering your life, but also the life of your unborn baby.

'With this, I am sending you all so much love. The transition my life has endured has been surreal - I never thought I would make it through the heartache and agony.

'But I'm here. I'm thriving. I'm smiling. And I've survived it.'

Speaking out: It comes after Malin revealed she was scared to reveal her pregnancy and sometimes fears her baby won't make it after she tragically lost daughter Consy

It comes after Malin revealed she was scared to reveal her pregnancy and sometimes fears her baby won't make it after she tragically lost daughter Consy.

Malin said she has been going to therapy to deal with 'unresolved feelings' around her daughter's passing.

She wrote: 'Hey. It feels like I've been here with you before. I have. I'll be honest, 3 years ago feels like a blur to me.. but feeling a new human growing inside me again feels so familiar. It scares me.

'So I'm here to welcome you on my journey with my rainbow baby. I know that sharing how I feel resonates.. and I want those that are struggling to conceive, or have lost a baby and are trying, pregnant with their rainbow baby or feel like their happy ending hasn't come yet - to see a clearer view through my life.

'And that actually we must trust the timing in everything. I haven't spoken to you much yet on how I've felt.. to be honest it's been a very weird journey so far. I was hesitant to even reveal my pregnancy.

'I have this inner hurt, this pain & that voice in my head that tells me this isn't real.. that my child won't survive - that something bad will happen. I've been very quiet.

Pregnancy: The star also shared a photo of herself in a vest and leggings on her Instagram Stories and wrote: 'Boobs - sore, big, veiny and for some reason the feeling of pregnancy feels so magical.'

'Malin quiet? That's strange - the queen of positive thinking.. waking up each day with not much to say. Just hope in her heart that baby will make it another day..'

Malin added that she appreciates every minute of life and is hoping for the best, adding that Consy is 'integrated' in her.

She said: 'See the reality is, we never really know what life can throw at us - we must remain present & mindful.. appreciate every minute. For sure I hope for the best, but I can't help past trauma creep up on me. She's integrated in me.

'Consy lives through me each day. I see her brown eyes open one last time.. and it gives me fear.. fear of the unknown. So what do I do? I've been going to therapy; remaining consistent.

'This has brought up a whole lot of unresolved feelings & pain that I seemed to have blocked out.. don't get me wrong I have the most amount of love and joy in my heart - but as I said.. I'm only human.'

The reality star added that she gets 'goosebumps' when she thinks about welcoming her child.

She wrote: 'We tend to always think the worst. When I realise what's growing inside me, I get goosebumps, I have to have a double take. Isn't it sad that sometimes things seem too good to be true? Well maybe, just maybe they aren't.

'I keep telling myself that this is my time.. And for f****n' sure - it is. Believe in your time. I'm here to tell you that your ending is only your beginning. Ma.'

The star also shared a photo of herself in a vest and leggings on her Instagram Stories and wrote: 'Boobs - sore, big, veiny and for some reason the feeling of pregnancy feels so magical.'

Malin revealed she was expecting a baby earlier this month when she a snap of her baby bump, with her hands and her boyfriend Jared's hands resting on it.

Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January 2019.

Malin wrote: 'I have this inner hurt, this pain & that voice in my head that tells me this isn't real.. that my child won't survive - that something bad will happen'

Since then Malin has struggled with further strife, reportedly left terrified after her violent ex recently broke his licence conditions meaning he has been sent back to prison.

Tom Kemp, 28, was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court in September after admitting to actual bodily harm, which left the reality star 'black and blue' but was released three months later in January.

The Sun recently reported that Tom - who was serving the remaining term on Home Detention Curfew - recently visited the area that the Love Island star lives.

He was then reportedly sent back to prison after failing to comply with the rules he was set as he continued to serve part of his sentence in the community.

A source told the publication: 'Malin was really shocked when she heard he had been in her area.

Tragic: Her daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was treated at London's Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away on 22 January 2019

'She had really hoped his prison sentence would mark the end of having to think about him ever again.

'The whole thing has been incredibly stressful, but Malin is very strong and just hopes he's learnt his lesson now.'

A source also told MailOnline: 'Malin was glad to hear that Tom had been sent back to prison for breaching his license conditions, but to learn that he only returned for a week due to his sentence coming to an end concerns her.

'She feels that far too often the justice system fails survivors of domestic violence and ultimately believes that this contributes to the reason why perpetrators continue to abuse.'

Tom, was jailed at last year after following an attack in which he broke her hand.

Scary: Malin has struggled with strife, reportedly left terrified after her violent ex Tom Kemp recently broke his licence conditions meaning he has been sent back to prison (pictured together in 2019)

TV star Malin previously accused the 'narcissist' of being abusive in Instagram posts in 2019 and shared pictures of herself with a cut cheek and bloodied nose.

But Tom, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time, branding her a 'liar with mental health issues'.

The former couple had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims Tom had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

In March they split again, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief.

In October, Malin told how she believes the physical abuse Tom subjected her to while she was pregnant was a factor behind her daughter's death at just one month old.

Awful: Tom Kemp, 28, was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court in September after admitting to actual bodily harm, which left the reality star 'black and blue' but was released three months later in January (Malin pictured with her injuries - taken at the time)

She revealed Kemp 'slapped and punched' her while she was six months pregnant, causing her to fall on her back and her stomach to hit the side of a bed.

Speaking to The Sun, Malin said she is convinced the incident contributed to Consy's death as after a few days, she noticed she wasn't moving around as much.

A month later, the movements reduced again and Malin insisted Kemp drive her to the hospital where doctors discovered Consy's irregular heartbeat, leading her to have an emergency cesarean that day at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

She said: 'When Tom threw me about, I'd tense my stomach so much, I could feel her pausing inside me. The doctors didn't understand what happened to her, but I know in my heart.'

Injuries: Tom left Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade

In June last year, Malin posted a lengthy Instagram post, captioned: 'The third and final lot, I am NOT a victim anymore.'

Calling their romance 'toxic and unhealthy', she said 'it has been an ongoing battle to emotionally let go as dealing with the grief from both my mum and daughter I've had him as my comforter.'

Accusing Kemp of emotional and physical abuse she said: 'Including being spat at, hit, pushed, kicked, scratched, spoken down to, controlled, manipulated, cheated and so much more I experienced the worst pain yet to come last night.'

Malin claimed she had received a phone call from a woman asking why the star had been texting her 'boyfriend.'

She wrote: 'After a calm and collected call with her we had finally came to the confirmation they have been speaking since January (when our daughter was in intensive care).'

Shocking: Tom, was jailed at last year after following an attack in which he broke her hand (pictured are the injuries to her face)

'While I've been focusing on my mental health I've been receiving multiple emails, calls, texts from one extreme to the other (I'm a bad mum, my mum hates me I'm going to hell to the extreme of I love you I can't be without you etc.

'This ladies is a fine example of a narcissistic man.

'I will NOT be another victim to domestic violence, I will not be beaten mentally or physically when I've fought through so much worse than this.

Adding that she was 'exhausted, heartbroken and confused' she urged her followers to 'listen to your gut and learn to love yourself.'

Special day: Ringing in her special day on Instagram on Monday, the TV star looked fresh-faced while pulling faces for her social media followers and declaring: 'This is 54'

Ulrika wrote in full: 'This is 54. Happy Birthday, to me. What I know so far: I'm a lioness of boundless proportions. I am fierce; I am loyal. Passion courses through my veins; fire scorches my heart and imagination canters like a wild horse through my buoyant, tangled mind.

'I love with reckless abandon and ardour at times when caution and circumspection might be the order of the day. Lying down with lions has never perturbed me. But the futility of attempting to change the shape of my heart has never been lost on me. I am who I am.'

She added: 'I may be too much. But I am never not enough. I'm instinctive and intuitive. An empath; a lover, a carer and nurturer. I am learning to put myself first but it turns out to be a vigorous lesson to learn. I am a woman of substance. I am a complicated soul.'

Ulrika concluded: 'I can be apprehensive and impatient. And I don't like goat's cheese.'

'Complicated soul': Posting a lengthy caption alongside the intimate snaps, Ulrika branded herself 'a complicated soul' and 'a lioness of boundless proportions'

Ulrika's birthday post comes four days after she returned from Corfu, where she had been visiting her eldest daughter, Bo.

While there, the doting mother shared plenty of sunny snaps with her followers, including a sizzling series of bathroom selfies in which she donned a bright yellow bikini.

Ulrika added: 'I love with reckless abandon and ardour at times when caution and circumspection might be the order of the day'

Ulrika set off for her mother-daughter holiday shortly after revealing her youngest son Malcolm, 13, finally had settled status in the UK and can remain for an 'indefinite period'.

Malcolm recently returned from America where his advertising executive father Brian Monet is from.

Ulrika said the thought of him being 'adopted abroad' would have been 'messy' so she is grateful to have him back home.

The media personality took to Instagram earlier in August to share a snap of Malcolm posing with a lightsaber.

Alongside the post, she wrote: 'Tonight I had a 27min instruction on lightsabers from the youngest Ungrateful.

Ulrika concluded: 'I can be apprehensive and impatient. And I don't like goat's cheese'

'He has just returned from the States where he custom made one. Himself.

'This is important because today I was told by the @ukhomeoffice that this half-yank, half-Viking boy has been given leave to stay in this country for an indefinite period. He finally has Settled Status.

'Which is a huge relief because the thought of having him adopted abroad was gonna be messy.

Relieved: Ulrika revealed her youngest son Malcolm (pictured), 13, has finally settled status in the UK and can remain for an 'indefinite period'

'So thank you, UK for letting me keep him by my side. And if anyone is interested in lightsabers, you know where to find the bugger.'

Ulrika was married to ex-husband Brian for eleven years before the couple parted ways in 2019.

She is also mother to son Cameron, 26, with John Turnbull, daughter Bo with ex Markus Kempen and daughter Martha, 17, with Lance Gerrard-Wright.

Taking to Instagram to show off their new looks, Sheridan quipped this is how they look 'without a filter' in the images - which saw the pair transformed into a wicked witch and troll.

It's the second time the pair have teamed up for Sky One, after both taking part in last year's Jack & The Beanstalk: After Ever After.

'Me with no filter!' Sheridan Smith transformed into a wicked witch while David Walliams morphed into a troll in first look at Hansel & Gretel: After Ever After

The After Ever After takes a look at what would happen after the 'happily ever after' in classic fairytales, with this new project focusing on the villains in Hansel and Gretel.

In the snaps, Sheridan, 40, sports a prosthetic nose and crooked yellow teeth while clad in a black smock and witches hat.

David, 49, dons a brown troll mask with seaweed attached to his head and giant fangs.

Sheridan captioned the snaps: 'Me and the tv husband @dwalliams with no filter! god he gives me such glamorous roles!'

While David quipped the pair were 'looking lovelier than ever'.

While an exact release date has yet to be announced, Hansel & Gretel: After Ever After is expected to air around Christmas time.

New look: Taking to Instagram to show off their new looks, Sheridan quipped this is how they look 'without a filter' in the images - which saw the pair transformed into fairy tale creatures

Sheridan's new project comes after she confirmed her split from ex-fiancé Jamie Horn last month - a year after they welcomed their son Billy together.

The couple shared a statement addressing their break up to The Sun, earlier this month, which read: 'It is with great sadness that we have decided to have some time apart.'

'We both remain completely committed to raising our beautiful boy Billy together. We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time. Thank you.'

A source told OK! magazine at the time: 'Sheridan is struggling to get through the split. She put him out there for everyone to see and she really thought he was The One.'

Back to their glamorous selves: David and Sheridan have worked together on past projects and are good friends (pictured together in 2013)

The insider also claimed that splitting from Jamie brought back pain Sheridan felt after losing her father Colin, who died from cancer, in 2016.

'She's devastated. This has brought back all the feelings of missing her dad because he was her tower of strength,' the source added.

'In her heart she's hoping they can make it right, but it doesn't look like there's any way back. They have a baby together and it's tough. She's heartbroken.'

Iconic duo: It's the second time the pair have teamed up for Sky One, after both taking part in last year's Jack & The Beanstalk: After Ever After

Sheridan and Jamie first began dating in 2018 after meeting on Tinder and reportedly got engaged after just three months together.

Jamie is said to have proposed to Sheridan in May 2018 and the couple were living together in a rented property in North London.

Sheridan's ex Jamie had appeared onscreen alongside her in a one-off documentary, titled Sheridan Smith: Becoming Mum, she filmed for ITV. It was released in 2020 and followed her pregnancy as a first time mum.

The singer, 32, who recently jetted abroad on holiday, had posted pictures of himself on Instagram by the sea, enjoying a platter of fresh fruit as he bathed in the sunshine.

Then Max, who recently filmed action movie Kill/Stream, decided he would try to see some more of the aquatic life around him by going swimming.

'Always wear goggles in the sea': The Wanted's Max George was left battered and bruised on Sunday after having an accident - which could have left him blind - while swimming in the sea

Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse as Max dived into the water and painfully collided with a rock on the seabed.

Showing off scratches to his face and an injury just below his eye, the frowning star told fans: 'Always wear goggles in the sea…'

He then joked: 'You should see the other guy. A MASSIVE rock at the bottom of the Adriatic.'

After fellow Wanted singer Tom Parker remarked on his Instagram post: 'Getting beaten up by the rock,' Max laughed: 'I hit my face on a rock at the bottom of the sea.'

Ouch! Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse as Max dived into the water and painfully collided with a rock on the seabed

Max’s girlfriend Stacey Giggs admitted that Max was a ‘muppet’ following the incident.

The pop sensation's injury around his right eye was particularly dangerous as Max already has sight loss in his right eye.

Max nearly lost his sight to an eye infection ten years ago, meaning part of his left eye had to be removed, but then he also had problems with his right.

He said at the time: 'I can’t see properly out of my right. My left eye does all the work.'

The upload comes after Max's former bandmate Tom, 33, revealed earlier in August that his cancer tumour has slightly reduced and his condition is stable after his latest scan which took place on his birthday.

The Wanted star admitted he was filled with worry ahead of his scan but got good news, despite it being later than usual.

'The tumour is slightly smaller': The upload comes after Max's former bandmate Tom Parker, 33, revealed that his cancer tumour has slightly reduced and his condition is stable

He told fans online: 'OK... here goes. The last couple of days have been filled with dread and worry but I’m pleased to announce that the results of yesterday’s scan (lovely birthday present), are stable with a slight reduction in the tumour if anything.

'I can’t tell you how grateful I am to receive this news. We left it a little longer between scans this time just to give time for the medication to work etc but overall a great day.

'Thanks to all our healthcare team. You are truly wonderful. And thank you all you lovely people out there sending love and support. It really is so appreciated. Time to celebrate.'

Tom previously revealed he's making a documentary about his terminal brain cancer, admitting that it has been an 'emotional process' so far.

The Wanted singer told his fans in October that he had been diagnosed with stage four Glioblastoma and he has been sharing his health battle on social media ever since.

The Aquaman leading man, 42, who shares daughter Lola Iolani, 14, and son Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha, 12, with wife Lisa Bonet, 53, was asked on the Australian program Fitzy & Wippa what they think of his early career work on Baywatch.

The 6ft4 screen star, who played the role of Jason Ioane on 44 episodes of the show from 1999 until 2001, replied, 'We don't say the B word here. We hide all of that mate! Never happened mate!'

The latest: Jason Momoa told the Australian program Fitzy & Wippa that he's kept his work on the TV series Baywatch under wrap from his kids, daughter Lola Iolani, 14, and son Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha, 12

'We don't talk about those words, the B word didn't happen,' he said.

The Honolulu, Hawaii native also said his kids haven't seen his work on the HBO show Game of Thrones, as he played the role of Khal Drogo from 2011-2012.

'They're not going to watch Game of Thrones either even though it's fantastic,' he said of the series, which contained graphic scenes depicting sex and violence.

He added: 'So right now superheroes and we're good.'

Hilarious: Momoa joked of the show, 'We don't talk about those words, the B word didn't happen'

Flashback: (L-R) Momoa, Jason Brooks and Michael Bergin were seen on the show Baywatch Hawaii in 2000

Things in the Zoom interview took an awkward turn when Wippa's wife Lisa gatecrashed the interview and revealed she had a little crush on the Hollywood hunk.

After the couple enjoyed a few cocktails before the chat, Lisa worked up the confidence to tell Momoa that he's welcome to stay at their $6.5million Rose Bay mansion the next time he's in Sydney.

'Hang on, my wife has just walked in, she was responsible for the eyebrow,' Wippa explained, after he shaved his eyebrow to match Jason's trademark eyebrow scar.

'Do you want to ask Jason a question honey?' Wippa asked.

Lisa excitedly chimed in, saying: 'Hi how are you Jason? Congratulations on the movie. This might sound really creepy, but when Covid-19 is over you're more than welcome to stay with us, we have a spare bedroom!'

Momoa hilariously quipped back: 'I'm there!'

Wippa then dryly remarked: 'You can hop out now honey. You were warned Jason, I apologize about that!'

Can't blame a girl for trying! Nova star Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli's wife Lisa left the radio host red-faced as she crashed his interview with Jason Momoa over the weekend

The American actor even hilariously tried out an Aussie accent every now and then throughout the chat, saying 'mate' with a twang upon occasion.

At one point, he spoke about his signature long hair with an Aussie accent and quipped: 'I've got the blonde ends mate!'

Momoa also sent a sweet message to his Australian fans, telling them to keep strong while in lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

'Tell everyone in Australia I love them,' Momoa said. 'I truly enjoy your country, sorry about the lockdown, I hope you all stay safe.'

The A-list action star appeared to promote his new project Sweet Girl, which is slated to be released August 20.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britain's big four banks' shares have been in the doldrums for years and sank once more as the coronavirus crisis hit.

Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays and NatWest have all reported that things aren't as bad as first feared, so could investors fall back in love with banks again?

On this episode of the Investing Show, Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, and This is Money's Simon Lambert delve into the big name banks, how they differ, and the challenges and opportunities they face.

From British economy bellwether Lloyds, to global mega bank HSBC, are they primed for profit in the recovery or will this be yet another false dawn?

Banks went into the Covid crisis in a considerably better position than through most of the financial crisis hangover and then set aside huge sums to deal with the economic impacts of lockdown.

But with recovery proving stronger-than-expected and the hit from bad loans not as bad as first thought, many of the big banks have released some of their emergency pile and are positioning themselves for growth as economies bounce back.

But the release of money set aside has flattered recent results and for many investors banks have major drawbacks: they have not been forgiven for the financial crisis and memory of their share price crashes lives on, while the big names are seen as utility -type stocks.

Meanwhile, even though higher interest rates and a dose of inflation are generally considered better for bank profits, their share prices have sunk with the wider market as it throws an inflation-fear wobble over the past week.

But does their unloved status make Britain's big banks a value opportunity or a wealth trap for money that could be put to better use elsewhere?




@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Hugely popular investment trust Scottish Mortgage shrugged off a year like no other to more than double its army of small investors’ money in 2020.

As investors weigh up whether it can keep climbing after such stellar recent performance, we speak to Scottish Mortgage’s Tom Slater on the Investing Show to discuss the past 12 months and the future.

This is Money’s Simon Lambert asks whether the coronavirus pandemic led its managers to consider a change of tack or renewed their enthusiasm for its long term holdings, and where they see the best opportunities for the decade ahead.

Scottish Mortgage’s share price climbed 105 per cent over the past year, spurred on by the performance of holdings including US stars, Tesla and Amazon, and China’s Tencent and Alibaba.

This came on top of the strong performance that has seen Scottish Mortgage gain 421 per cent compared to the AIC global sector trust average of 187 per cent over five years.

Such gains spell good news for investors looking in their portfolio’s rear view mirror, but pose important questions of whether history can be repeated – or at least continue to rhyme – for Scottish Mortgage in the future.

Meanwhile, the big share price rises and high profiles of some of Scottish Mortgage’s holdings lead to comments that such stocks must be difficult to manage.

How do you cope with a company like Tesla being 9 per cent of your portfolio, for example? And what does Tesla have to do to justify the valuation investors have put on it.

Scottish Mortgage's share price has more than doubled over the past year as the global trust and its holdings shrugged off the coronavirus pandemic

We asked Mr Slater about this and the manager explains the trust’s continuing long-term investments in Tesla and Amazon – but sale of Facebook - as well as the potential growth it sees in Chinese electric carmaker Nio and a more old-school motoring icon in Ferrari.

Scottish Mortgage dates back to 1909 and has grown to £18.8billion in size, holding stock market listed companies from around the world - with a particular focus on the US and China - along with its recently built up portfolio of unlisted companies.

But that big list of companies masks a relatively concentrated and highly active portfolio.

Many of Scottish Mortgage's holdings account for only small positions, whereas the trust's top ten amounts to 48.3 per cent of the portfolio and the top 37 holdings of 0.7 per cent or above accounts for 84.6 per cent.

Among the holdings below the top ten are well-known names including the aforementioned Ferrari, along with Netflix, Spotify, Wayfair, NVidia, ByteDance, Zoom and Covid-vaccine maker Moderna.

Mr Slater says this list shows that although Scottish Mortgage is often characterised as tech-heavy, the trust should be seen as targeting companies in a variety of sectors using technology to improve what they do.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@How should you invest through a crisis?

Some may feel it is premature to ask that about coronavirus, but with stock markets tumbling hard and fast around the world last week and the Federal Reserve slashing 0.5 per cent off rates, there is clear concern that this isn’t just any old correction.

The FTSE 100 has regained some ground this week, but fell 11 per cent last week in series of big daily drops not seen since the financial crisis.

What can investors do in a situation like this – other than not panic - and is it too late to act by the time your portfolio is a sea of red?

There is also the thorny question of what to when markets bounce back and how to spot if a rise like this week's will last.

On this episode of the Investing Show, we talk to Bill Dinning, chief investment officer of Waverton Investment Management, and a man with decades of investing experience to draw on about the impact of coronavirus on investors.

We ask how investors can position themselves for a correction, whether previously, high-flying markets make a prolonged downturn more likely and at what point you can start to ask if lower prices means that opportunity knocks?

Bill also shares his concerns on why the supposed safe haven of government bonds no longer works properly for investors.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The US dominates the world’s stock market and on a daily basis we hear about the household names in it and often use their products, from Amazon, to Facebook, Visa and Johnson & Johnson.

Many investors will be invested in those giants somewhere in their portfolio, but what about the US companies that don’t feature among the big guns?

US smaller companies are consistently some of the fastest-growing and most innovative in the world, with a huge market on their doorstep and the headroom to expand substantially.

But can UK investors navigate their way through this exciting market, deal with worries about sky-high valuations and spot the firms that will be long-term winners – and could ultimately become the Microsoft or Apple of the future.

On this episode of the Investing Show, we speak to Nick Ford, of the Miton US Smaller Companies fund to find out how he looks for companies that grow their sales and earnings for a long period of time and reward investors for years to come.

He explains to Simon Lambert, of This is Money, and Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, what he looks for in companies, whether he worries about valuations and names some of the companies he sees doing good things right now.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I'm disabled and receive Personal Independent Payment and Employment Support Allowance. My wife receives Carer's Allowance.

My pension age will be next November when I am 66-years old. What should I do now? What will happen to me if I apply for a state pension?

Will all my benefits go away or not? What will be best for me? I worked between March 1993 to 2000 before I became sick. I would be very grateful for your advice.

What now? This week's reader is worried how the state pension could affect their disability benefits

Steve Webb replies: The effect on your benefits of reaching pension age and drawing your state pension is different for different types of benefits.

We also need to think about your wife's Carer's Allowance. I should stress that I don't have full details of your personal circumstances so what follows is a general description of the rules.

I will provide some links later on for where you can check your exact personal situation.

Starting with your Personal Independence Payment (PIP), the good news is that this will continue after you reach pension age, provided that you continue to satisfy the other conditions for the benefit.

Although brand new claims for PIP are generally not possible from those over pension age, those who first claimed before pension age can go on receiving PIP into retirement.

Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below

Things are slightly more complicated with your Employment Support Allowance (ESA).

I'm guessing that you have been on ESA for a while and are receiving what is called 'income-based' ESA.

When you reach pension age, you are no longer able to claim ESA. But because you are part of a couple and it looks as though your wife is under pension age, you still come under the 'working age' benefits system.

This means that you would need to claim Universal Credit.

Once you start getting your state pension, every pound of state pension is deducted pound-for-pound from your Universal Credit.

Depending on the size of your state pension, it is possible that your income from state pension will be above the Universal Credit level and you would not be entitled.

However, because help with rent is now included within the Universal Credit system, if you live in rented accommodation you may still get help even if you have a significant state pension.

Things would change again once your wife reaches pension age.

First of all, your wife can claim her own state pension based on her own contributions.

However, assuming that her state pension is bigger than her Carer's Allowance, then her Carer's Allowance would unfortunately stop.

This is because of what are known as 'overlapping benefit rules' which apply when you would otherwise be entitled to two benefits at the same time, such as pension and Carer's Allowance.

Second, if as a couple you are on a low income you could now see if you are entitled to Pension Credit to top up your income rather than Universal Credit.

Although your wife may no longer get Carer's Allowance, she would have what is called an 'underlying entitlement' and this means a slightly higher rate of pension credit could be payable.

There are also additions for pension credit for 'severe disability', but in the case of a couple these generally apply only where both partners are receiving disability benefits in their own right.

As you can see, the rules are complex and depend on whether one or both of you is over pension age.

I would strongly advise you and your wife to get a state pension forecast so that you know how much you will be getting from that source.

You might also find it helpful to talk to a local welfare rights advice service such as Citizens Advice, or to check your position via a benefits calculator website.

The three calculator websites recommended by the Government are:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The owner of the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn hotel chains swung back to profit in the first half of the year as loosening travel restrictions provided a much-need boost for the accommodation industry.

Intercontinental Hotels Group recorded an operating profit of $138million following a strong recovery in demand over the spring and summer months compared to the same time last year.

Its Holiday Inn Express brand saw the greatest increase in gross revenues, growing by around $700million to $2.7billion thanks to high demand in Greater China and the Americas.

Recovery: IHG's Holiday Inn Express brand saw the greatest increase in gross revenues, thanks to high demand in Greater China and the Americas

On a revenue per available room (RevPAR) basis - a standard measure used by the hospitality sector - the group's sales almost doubled in China and rose by more than a quarter in the Americas.

However, bookings in all regions remain significantly lower than their pre-pandemic levels due to tough international travel rules, with trade in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia continuing to be severely depressed.

Even as demand started to improve in May and June, IHG's total occupancy rates were 21 per cent down on the comparable period two years ago, while RevPAR was more than 40 per cent lower.

The firm has had to rely heavily on domestic excursions for their business, but even in high-performing markets like China and the Americas, tourists have not visited major cities in larger numbers.

This could be because they have wanted to avoid more crowded places where the risk of becoming infected by Covid-19 is higher.

Tourism-dependent companies in big cities like London, such as museums, theatres, and conference centres have also been forced to temporarily close their premises for much of the last year.

Quieter year: IHG's bookings in all regions remain significantly lower than their pre-pandemic levels due to tough international travel rules hitting demand, especially in big cities

They also rely heavily on foreign travellers, which combined with the imposition of travel restrictions, has caused a massive knock-on effect for the hotel sector.

Nonetheless, IHG's chief executive Keith Barr expressed optimism about the firm's results, commenting that the 'actions we have taken during the last 18 months position us well to exceed our pre-pandemic level of growth and profitability.'

He noted that nearly half of the company's hotels had seen RevPAR in July recover to their equivalent amount in 2019, and that there had been a resurgence in group activity and corporate bookings.

'While there is a risk of trading volatility in the balance of the year, and discretionary business trips, group bookings and international travel will take time to fully recover, we are confident in the strength of IHG's future prospects,' he added.

Resurgence: IHG chief executive Keith Barr said that nearly half of the company's hotels had seen RevPAR in July recover to their equivalent amount in 2019

IHG opened 132 hotels with 17,400 rooms and signed more than 200 during the reporting period and is planning to launch a new luxury brand in the coming weeks to complement its Six Senses, Regent and Kimpton brands.

Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at online trading platform AJ Bell, said this move by IHG 'suggests it reckons regular foreign travel might be dominated by wealthier holidaymakers in the future amid the extra costs and complexity of jetting overseas.

'InterContinental's model should, in theory, leave it well-positioned to rebound as the economy recovers, given it does not have lots of capital tied up in owning hotels.'

She warned, though, that this model 'does arguably give it less control over the pace of growth, with its hotel estate expanding much more slowly than that of rivals like Marriott and Hilton in the first half of the year.'

Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, further observed that IHG's Chinese market is looking more vulnerable following the reintroduction of Covid restrictions there in June to try and stem cases linked to the Delta variant.

'There’s no telling,' she adds, 'whether this will continue as variant concerns set in, but we’re mindful that China seems to be a few steps ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to the pandemic.

'If lockdowns ramp up through the rest of the summer, it could be a bleak forecast for other regions, which would chip away at IHG’s already precarious recovery.'

Shares in IHG closed trading 0.6 per cent lower at £47.05 on Tuesday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Watches of Switzerland has recorded a robust three months of sales thanks to substantial demand from domestic customers in Britain and the US.

The luxury retailer saw sales of both watches and jewellery nearly double in the 13 weeks to the start of August compared to the same time in 2020 when it was severely hit by store closures.

Shares in the firm rose by 3.3 per cent to £10.58 on Tuesday as it revealed online sales also continued to grow despite British outlets being open throughout the three-month period, though at a more moderate rate of 15.9 per cent.

Good times: The luxury retailer saw sales of watches climb by 97.1% to more than £250m whilst luxury jewellery purchases grew by 98.9% to £20.1m

Its total first-quarter revenues jumped 101.9 per cent to £297.5million at constant currency levels, but they were also 45.8 per cent higher on a two-year basis.

Sales of luxury watches continued to represent the overwhelming bulk of purchases by consumers, climbing by 97.1 per cent to more than £250million whilst luxury jewellery sales shot up 98.9 per cent to £20.1million.

The FTSE 250 group said the impressive performance strengthened its existing full-year guidance, which revenues expected to be between £1.05billion and £1.1billion, a rise of 16 per cent to 21 per cent on the previous year.

The company's chief executive Brian Duffy told the Press Association that customers have opted to treat themselves, helping sales at the business to soar.

He said: 'In the UK and US there is accumulated disposable income and we are an attractive category in that sense. We call our categories "rational indulgences".

'Buying a beautiful luxury watch, you can feel confident that it's going to preserve value, it's going to last forever, it's a family heirloom.

'So, therefore, in these circumstances, when people have money to spend, our category is high up in their priority list. So, definitely, we've benefited from that.'

Watches of Switzerland CEO Brian Duffy said: 'Buying a beautiful luxury watch, you can feel confident that it's going to preserve value, it's going to last forever, it's a family heirloom'

'There is a willingness for people to trade up and indulge a bit more, maybe buying gold when they were thinking of buying a mix of gold and steel,' he said.

Revenues grew at a fast pace in the group's biggest market, the UK, where it has recently opened two boutique establishments selling just OMEGA and Breitling wares in Edinburgh, as well as a TAG Heuer store in Manchester.

But compared to two years ago, sales have expanded more rapidly in the US, where it said footfall in its Las Vegas and New York has quickly recovered, and its eight new mono-brand boutiques are 'performing strongly.'

It is planning to open more Watches of Switzerland outlets in Cincinnati, Ohio, the New Jersey-based shopping and entertainment centre, American Dream, and in the London district of Battersea.

Mr Duffy still pointed out that the pandemic did affect the company - hitting it for £100million - but said it had suffered less of an impact than other high street businesses even as tourism levels continued to remain severely weak.

He remarked. 'A big part of our business is where we can't get enough product to meet demand - Rolex in particular.

'So, the fact that we weren't selling products in the airports and to tourists meant more clients domestically and we were able to take advantage of that.

'It sounds very clever to have pivoted the business to the domestic market, but to be honest, the demand was there.'

Forced to keep its stores shut for lockdown for most of the period, the group's UK retail arm sank to a £39million loss in the first half.

However, in June - when shops were able to re-open - Flutter's revenue equated to around 80 per cent of levels seen in the same month of 2019 with the firm labeling it 'encouraging.'

With a strong performance in the US, the Dublin-based group also saw its global total revenues surge over the period.

Impact: Paddy Power and Betfair owner Flutter Entertainment saw revenue from its UK-based stores drop by 47% in the first six months of this year

Across all global operations, Flutter said it raked in raked in more than £3billion in revenue in the first half of 2021, marking a 99 per cent increase from the same point a year ago.

The revenue growth was largely driven by a 40 per cent rise in average monthly players.

The company's overall pre-tax profits surged from £24million to £77million, representing a 221 per cent increase.

Shares in FTSE 100-listed Flutter have risen sharply this morning and were up 7.5 per cent - or 965p - to 13,905.00p at 9.45am. A year ago the group's share price was 11,650.00p.

Flutter's merger with The Stars Group in May last year has been a being a key factor in driving growth and enabling the company to rapidly expand in the US.

The group said its FanDuel product captured 45 per cent of the online sportsbook market share.

The group recorded a loss of 50.4p per share in a statement this morning, down from 18.1p per share at the beginning of last year.

While the betting group's net debt fell by 7 per cent in the six months to the end of June, it remains at nearly £2.7billion.

Group boss Peter Jackson said the firm's financials 'exceeded' expectations.

He added: 'In the US, we remain the number one online sports betting operator by some distance thanks to the quality of our products and the extensive reach of the FanDuel brand.

'The customer economics we are seeing in the US bode very well for the future.

'In the UK and Ireland, integration is progressing well with our three brands benefiting from shared learnings across product and operations.'

Popular: FanDuel has helped Flutter rake in more customers and cash in the last few months

Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group, said: 'Flutter Entertainment PLC's interim results today paint an extremely positive picture for the company.

'The business grew substantially during this period, with 30 per cent revenue growth primarily driven by a 40 per cent increase in average monthly players.'

'The only negative factor remains the sizeable level of net debt which is around £2.682billion and continues to weigh on the businesses’ ability to pay dividends.'

He added: 'The company has also continued its commitment to safer gambling during this period as it boosted investment in resources and technology to optimise its controls.

'The company has already reported a solid start to the second half of the year. With further expansion across critical markets expected, the next six months look positive for the business and its stakeholders.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vodafone will start charging customers roaming fees again with consumers facing paying £2-a-day to use their monthly allowance in Europe.

The network joins EE in re-introducing the charges after the UK left the EU.

Customers will have to start paying from January 2022 although some will be able to cut the cost to £1-a-day by paying for a multi-day pass.

Mobile firms were banned from charging customers extra fees to use their UK allowance of minutes, texts and data in Europe while the UK was still part of the EU.

Vodafone will start charging customers roaming fees with consumers paying out £2 a day

However, now the post-Brexit transition is over, these rules no longer apply.

Vodafone's new £2-a-day flat fee will apply to any customers who sign up to a new contract or renew their existing one on or after 11 August 2021, unless they opt for one of its '4 Xtra' tariffs, which include roaming.

The new charge will not come into force until 6 January and customers can continue to roam for free, subject to a fair usage policy of 25GB per month, until then.

The fair usage policy sets a limit on how much customers can use without being charged extra fees.

If you are an existing Vodafone customer, you will not affected by these charges straight away, but will be when you renew your contract or change plans.

Consumers will also have the option of buying longer 'roaming passes' letting them use their home allowance in Europe.

For example, an eight-day pass will cost £8 while a 15-day pass will cost £15.

A Vodafone spokesperson said: 'We are changing the number of plans that include roaming in our Europe Zone as standard.

'Roaming, in Europe and beyond, will still be included at no extra cost in selected plans, and new roaming passes at £1 per day will be introduced.

'Existing customers will not be impacted by these changes while they remain on their current price plan, and roaming in the Republic of Ireland will still be included for all customers.

Now the post-Brexit transition is over, mobile networks can charge for roaming abroad again

'Fewer than half of our customers roamed beyond the Republic of Ireland in 2019.

'Rather than have all of our customers affected by including the additional costs of roaming into all of our tariffs, customers will be able to choose a plan that comes with roaming included, or purchase an additional roaming pass.'

'Our ambition is to ensure customers don't ever experience "bill shock" when roaming with Vodafone, because all of our plans and passes will have clear usage caps.'

EE also previously revealed it will charge new customers, and those upgrading from July 7, a £2 daily fee from January 2022.

Though it does not include existing customers, anyone who upgrades and renews their contract from the same date will also have to pay.

O2 also revealed customers will be charged £3.50 for every gigabyte used over 25GB - but this means any usage up until this amount will be under their normal plan and not charged extra.

However, Three has not yet announced any plans to change its policy, although it has reduced its fair cap usage from 20GB to 12GB.

This means customers using more than this will be charged.

Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at Uswitch, said: 'Any reintroduction of roaming charges means that consumers are paying a fee to use data and minutes they have already paid for.

'In the aftermath of Brexit, the UK’s biggest mobile providers all said that they had no immediate plans to change their charging models for consumers roaming within the EU.

'It’s disappointing for consumers to see that the situation looks to be shifting, with a risk that roaming at no additional cost could soon be a distant memory for UK residents.

'When it comes to travelling, don’t leave it till the last minute to check the roaming charges for your destination, and always use hotel and cafe Wi-Fi when on holiday where possible.'

Customers are urged to be careful how much data they use when travelling abroad.

Two bereaved daughters received sums of £42,000 and £71,000 because their mothers were underpaid state pension for more than a decade before dying in their 90s.

The payouts are all thanks to the intrepid work of investment and pensions editor Tanya Jefferies and our pensions agony uncle Sir Steve Webb.

They join deputy editor Lee Boyce and Georgie Frost to talk about these latest cases, and what it means in terms of inheritance tax and care fees – could you, a family member or friend have been caught up in the scandal?

We also talk about pensions in more details – do you know what yours is invested in and what it's worth?

It will matter even more than usual if the Chancellor gets his way and taps into our retirement pots and parcel it out to fast-growing businesses, transport projects, real estate and carbon-friendly investments.

We also discuss the new green savings bonds from NS&I: how long is the term, what's the rate and just how green are they?

There’s just one problem: your home is on the market and you aren’t even getting any offers. Perhaps you are in a property coldspot.

As property watchers will tell you, the house price index-driven view of a national housing market is something of an illusion. In reality, there are lots of different local property markets and they don’t all blow hot and cold at the same time.

At the moment, while some areas are running hot, others are cold – and it’s not as simple as city vs village, or urban vs rural. Even within London, there are some areas with high demand and others just a few miles away where it is tough to sell.

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Adrian Lowery and Simon Lambert look at how to take the temperature of your local property market and how that can help you buy or sell.

They discuss what next for house prices – and whether they can possible keep rising at such a robust pace from here, or if we could see more stability and an end to Britain’s casino property market.

Also on this week’s show: how to invest in companies that will help improve the environment, the FCA’s warning on thrill-seeking young investors and the best Isa investments of all time.

And finally, the electric car grant has been cut and will be axed for all cars costing more than £35,000.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Chancellor’s coronavirus rescue plan for the British economy has been bold and big, but one important part of the workforce feels somewhat hard done by.

A chunk of the self-employed have been excluded from Rishi Sunak’s support in a way that employees have not.

More than 9million employees are having 80 per cent of their wages up to £2,500 a month paid by the taxpayer under the furlough scheme, with no limits barring high earners from help.

In contrast, anyone who is self-employed and has made more than £50,000 in recent years gets no help whatsoever.

Those hit by the £50,000 cap are not the limited company directors who can pay themselves in dividends, they are sole traders paying national insurance and income tax in full on their earnings.

At a time when the government is throwing hundreds of billions of pounds at the coronavirus crash to support people and boost the chances of recovery, is it fair to exclude this group of the self-employed?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert, Georgie Frost and Tanya Jefferies look at how this has happened and whether there is any hope left for those affected that things might change.

Tanya also updates listeners on her ground-breaking investigations into widows underpaid state pension, which have seen her win tens of thousands of pounds back for those who got less than they should have.

Simon reveals the best and worst performing funds of the year so far and tries to tackle the question of whether the US stock market can just keep on trucking.

On this week's podcast we look at how the mortgage squeeze compares to what happened after the financial crisis, how this will affect those who want to buy and those who need to remortgage.

Storm clouds: With lenders pulling deals for first-time buyers, what could it do to the rest of the property market?

Will the crunch last and send house prices down? Or has Britain's property market got the kind of Terminator characteristics that will see it claw its way back up from coronavirus?

Also, this week, as inflation nosedives we look at how savers can now beat the cost of living – are they really better off?

And finally, while the nation is supposedly feeling the punch from the economic effects of coronavirus, there are some strange spending patterns going on.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former Olympic athlete Matt Gotrel says he struggled to make ends meet after winning gold as a rower for Team GB in Rio, 2016.

Gotrel, 32, told Donna Ferguson he ended up teaching schoolboys how to row just to earn enough money to pay for food.

After getting a job as an engineer, he then became a professional sailor, enabling him to return to competitive sport and compete in last year's America's Cup.

He was awarded an MBE for services to rowing in 2017 and is an ambassador for MyClubGroup.co.uk – an organisation which helps grassroots sports clubs improve their finances.

Golden boys: Matt Gotrel (circled) with his team-mates at the Rio Olympics in 2016

Would you like to be in Japan competing in the Olympics?

Yes. The Olympics are the pinnacle of sport. Each time I watch it, I get goosebumps. I would be lying to myself if I pretended I didn't want to be there competing.

At the same time, I feel like I drew a line under what I achieved in Rio 2016 and it was a good time for me to leave rowing. But competing in the Olympics is special and to me it always will be.

Why do you think the rowers performed so poorly in Japan?

It's been a tough year with Covid. A lot of our rowers have been training alone in their garages. Other European nations were still able to train as a group while we were all locked down.

It's been hard to watch some of the performances, but to say they did poorly is harsh – a lot of the time, these events come down to very small margins. Fourth place could easily have been a medal on another occasion and some of our medals could have been different colours.

Having said that, you can't deny that it hasn't been our best showing ever. There have been a lot of changes in British rowing with head coach Jurgen Grobler leaving and new coaches coming in. There's been a lot of transition for the team, but hopefully they'll come back stronger.

What did your parents teach you about money?

That it doesn't grow on trees and that you need to work hard for it. My parents worked long hours, running their own jewellery business. Money wasn't tight, but they were frugal. For example, I was always into sports, but I never had the best gear. They would always buy my stuff second-hand.

I'm not frugal myself – I like spending, rather than saving – but I am quite sensible with money and like to plan ahead.

Matt said: 'Competing in the Olympics is special and to me it always will be' after winning gold

Have you ever struggled to make ends meet?

Yes. The worst time was probably in 2017, after I had won Olympic gold in the Men's Eight rowing event at Rio.

I decided to retire and not go back to rowing. There was a period where I had no real idea what I was going to do for a living or where my income was going to come from.

That was a tough time. I ended up freeloading a little bit – I moved in with my girlfriend and didn't contribute towards the cost of our accommodation. I was coaching local schoolboys at a rowing club, just so I could earn enough to eat and pay for food.

After about three months, I'd had enough. I still didn't know what I wanted to do – but it got to the point that I felt I had to get a job and pay my own way. I fell back on my engineering degree and went to Rolls-Royce to work as an engineer.

That wasn't a job I consciously wanted to do, or a route I would have gone down if I hadn't been having these financial issues.

It was all a bit of a comedown after Rio. I felt a bit lost. Everything in my life had been leading up to that gold medal in Rio. Then, after that moment, it was hard to figure out what my purpose was, what I was going to do with my life. It took a while to adjust and come to terms with that.

How did you turn your fortunes around?

An old sailing contact got in touch and asked if I'd like to go sailing again as part of a professional team. I had sailed as a kid, but then started rowing at Loughborough University.

So, after I'd worked at Rolls-Royce for a year, I was able to go and be an athlete again. I think being fit and having the discipline of a rower helped me succeed as a sailor.

Being part of a team, aiming for one goal, is what I am used to. It felt natural to be back doing sport again. It's the environment where I am happiest.

My finances improved when I joined the sailing team. Like Formula 1 and cycling, you get big sponsors in the professional world of sailing, whereas rowing is an amateur sport.

As a rower, the maximum grant you can get is £28,000 a year tax-free and even that is based on your performance. As a sailor, you can earn a six-figure sum.

Have you ever been paid silly money?

Yes, because I do quite a lot of motivational talks. I can earn up to £2,000 for a half-hour speech. I talk about my journey and the things I've learned. I also talk about goal setting.

How, as an athlete, you have to just look one step ahead and focus on the job you have to do the next day, rather than the deadline you have in a month's time.

What was the best year of your financial life?

The last tax year ending April 5. I was sailing in the 36th America's Cup for Ineos Team UK. I'd rather not say how much I earned, but it was more than I made when I was rowing.

The most expensive thing you ever bought for fun?

An artwork for £2,000. I'd describe it as an abstract seascape with blues and greens and bits of wood. I have no idea who the artist is – my wife and I just liked it.

What is your biggest money mistake?

Racking up debt on a couple of credit cards after Rio. I ran up about £4,000 and it took me a couple of years to clear it.

The best money decision you have made?

Taking the advice of a financial adviser. While I was a rower, I had quite a lot of disposable income because I hardly spent anything. I trained for six hours every day, even at weekends, and lived in cheap shared accommodation with five other rowers.

Since all I did for years was train, eat and sleep, there was no time to spend.

The adviser helped me start a pension at age 24 and invest through an Isa. By the time I was 29, my Isa had increased in value by about 20 per cent.

That formed my share of the deposit my wife and I put down on our first home in Cheltenham, which we bought for £225,000 in 2017.

We now live in a four-bedroom house, just outside Cheltenham, which we bought just before the pandemic.

What is the one luxury you treat yourself to?

Going skiing. I wasn't allowed to ski when I was rowing because of the injury threat. So I missed out on about seven winters. Now, I try to go once a year if I can afford it. My favourite place is Morzine in France. It typically costs £2,000 including flights.

If you were Chancellor, what would you do?

I would introduce an incentive to homeowners to encourage them to sell to first-time buyers, not buy-to-let landlords. I'd give the seller a one per cent stamp duty cut on their next property purchase if they did that.

Do you donate money to charity?

Yes, I do sporadically. And I always play the National Lottery because I've been on the receiving end of its funding. They support some great causes and do amazing work for sport in our country – from grassroots to Olympic level.

What is your number one financial priority?

To look after my family. My wife recently gave birth to our daughter, Lara. I want to make sure I can always provide for them both.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The global shortage of chips used in vehicles means manufacturers are unable to produce enough cars to meet demand - and drip-feed of deliveries means registrations are falling way behind the 10-year average

New car registrations in Britain fell a third annually in July and is down more than a fifth on the decade average for the month as the ongoing global semiconductor chip shortage continues to strangle the motor industry.

Official figures released today show that 123,296 new passenger vehicles were bought in the UK last month, which is 29.5 per cent fewer than a year ago and the lowest volume of registrations in July for 23 years.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the size of the decline has been artificially inflated due to a huge surge in vehicle sales in July 2020 - the first month motor dealers were allowed to reopen their doors to the public following the initial national Covid-19 lockdown.

However, sales were still 22.3 per cent down on the 10-year average for the seventh month of the year, despite there being plenty of demand for brand new cars.

Industry bosses have blamed the decline in registrations on both the global chip shortage and lower factory outputs as a result of the 'pingdemic'.

But while the logjam of deliveries caused by the worldwide lack of semiconductors is without questions causing huge delays for customers waiting on the arrival of new motors, the argument for a shortage of staff is only true of British built vehicles.

The stats show that the decline in registrations was predominantly driven by shrinking deliveries to large fleets which, at 61,140 units, was more than a quarter (28.7 per cent) down on the average recorded over the past decade.

Private registrations declined by a lesser extent, falling by 10.7 per cent to 59,841 new cars, though with the shortage of chips predicted to run into 2022, these figures could fall off even further for the remaining five months of the year.

As a result, the latest SMMT outlook has been revised downward and now forecasts registrations to reach around 1.82 million units in 2021.

This is still some 11.7 per cent up on 2020, but down from the 1.86 million forecast in April, and a massive 21.8 per cent off the average new car market figures dating back to 2010.

Official figures released this morning show that 123,296 new passenger vehicles were bought in the UK last month, which is 29.5% fewer than a year ago and the lowest volume of registrations in July for 23 years

The stats show that the decline in registrations was predominantly driven by shrinking deliveries to large fleets

Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: 'The automotive sector continues to battle against shortages of semiconductors and staff, which is throttling our ability to translate a strengthening economic outlook into a full recovery.

'The next few weeks will see changes to self-isolation policies which will hopefully help those companies across the industry dealing with staff absences, but the semiconductor shortage is likely to remain an issue until at least the rest of the year.

'As a result, we have downgraded the market outlook slightly for 2021.'

Richard Peberdy, UK head of automotive at KPMG, said the volumes in car registrations published today are not 'reflective of the real demand picture'.

He explained: 'When you dive deeper into the data it is clear that supply chain challenges have supressed production and extended carmakers' delivery times. Quite simply, fewer cars are getting onto forecourts.'

Richard Peberdy, UK head of automotive at KPMG, said the volumes in car registrations published today are not 'reflective of the real demand picture'

Ian Plummer, commercial director at Auto Trader echoed Mr Peberdy's comment.

'It would be easy to misinterpret these results as a drop in consumer demand for new cars, but our data shows that that couldn't be further from the truth.

'In fact, 1.4 million people viewed a new car on Auto Trader in July, which is up six per cent compared to last year's post lockdown July sales burst and more than double 2019 levels.

'With such strong demand, we're clearly in the grips of a 'seller's market' at the moment, although the potential lost sales make the supply constraints all the more frustrating for car brands and retailers alike while they're unable to reap all the benefits of this bounce back.'

As reported last month by This is Money, the knock-on effect of limited new car deliveries has forced many impatient drivers to scour the second-hand market for their replacement motors.

Plummer says Auto Trader found that three quarters of car buyers are prepared to buy a used car if their brand-new choice wasn't available - though this huge surge in demand has pushed used car prices up a record 14.1 per cent year-on-year. He said this is 'a trend which we may begin to see in the new car market too'.

The drip-feed of deliveries of new models is now starting to impact on sales volumes per model, with the Volkswagen Polo the most-bought new car in July, ahead of the Toyota Yaris and Kia Sportage.

The Vauxhall Corsa - the best-selling car so far this year - didn't make it into the top 10, while the most popular model for the last 12 years - Ford's Fiesta - languished down in ninth spot, showing just how volatile the standings have become under the constraints of supply issues.

The VW Polo supermini was the best-selling new car of July, with just over 3,000 registrations

The Vauxhall Corsa remains the nation's most-bought new car in 2021, though Ford's Fiesta has closed the gap in July with its rival not featuring in the top 10 most-registered models

SMMT also confirmed that the chip shortage is beginning to have a toll on the new van market, which posted its first decline since December 2020 as July registrations fell 15 per cent due to a lack of new model supply.

Jim Holder, editorial director of magazine and website What Car?, said: 'The appetite for car buying is clearly there, particularly as people reward themselves after lockdown.

'But the challenge is for manufacturers and retailers to manage customer expectations and to build pipelines in the meantime, while supply is limited.

'Ultimately, the supply issues will lift – but only those who have invested in servicing customer expectations will be in a position to reap the rewards as they do so.

Electric car sales remain on upward trajectory

The recent bumper growth in plug-in vehicles continued in July, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounting for 9 per cent of registrations, while plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) reached 8 per cent of market share.

With a combined 21,039 registrations of BEV and PHEV cars, it means there are more new vehicles being sold with plugs attached than diesels, with 15,592 sales of conventional and mild-hybrid oil burners in July.

SMMT now estimates that BEVs will account for 9.5 per cent of registrations by year end, while PHEVs are forecast to comprise 6.5 per cent of the market, collectively totalling around 290,000 units by the end of the year.

Mr Hawes described the rising sales of electrified vehicles as a 'bright spot' in the statistics and a reflection of consumers responding in ever greater numbers to 'new technologies, driven by increased product choice, fiscal and financial incentives and an enjoyable driving experience'.

SMMT estimates BEVs will account for 9.5% of registrations by year end and PHEVs will comprise 6.5% of the market, collectively totalling around 290,000 units by the close of 2021

KMPG says the increase in sales is a direct result of more companies offering salary sacrifice schemes to their staff for these vehicles, often making the choice as affordable as petrol or diesel, which is a major tipping point for the battery electric vehicle sector.

However, it warned that the rapid rate of development of EVs could mean today's plug-in cars suffer above average depreciation as motorists look to versions with longer ranges and shorter charge times.

'Interestingly, demand for electric vehicles may drive a bigger shift towards leasing and subscription models in the medium term versus outright ownership,' Peberdy explained.

'The technology is advancing quickly, with increasingly efficient and longer range vehicles set to roll off production lines soon.

'This risks a faster depreciation of today's models for consumers. Customers may want greater visibility and assurance over resale values and the total cost of ownership.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Frontier Developments is another highly successful video games company. The group was floated on the stock market in 2013, since when it has grown by leaps and bounds, moving from developing titles for third parties to publishing games in its own right.

Publishing can be tricky. If games flop, losses can be ruinous, but Frontier has proved its mettle, attracting millions of players across the world with games such as Jurassic World Evolution, Planet Zoo and Elite Dangerous.

Like Sumo, Frontier is run by its founder, David Braben. Now 57, Braben created his first game while studying Natural Sciences at Cambridge University 39 years ago.

Popular: Frontier has attracted millions of players across the world with games such as Jurassic World Evolution, Planet Zoo and Elite Dangerous

Frontier is still based in Cambridge and Braben remains enthused by the industry to this day, believing that games are a creative force, a way to bring people together across the globe and a means of delivering robust returns for shareholders.

One of those shareholders is Tencent. The Chinese group has an 8.6 per cent holding in Frontier and a seat on the board. Braben sees Tencent as a supportive investor that gives Frontier access to the Chinese market. Others may wonder whether Tencent's intentions go further. Perhaps they do – or perhaps they will in time.

For now, however, an imminent takeover seems unlikely. Tencent has its hands full with Sumo Group, while Braben owns 33 per cent of Frontier and has huge ambitions for the business.

Even so this may be a good opportunity to buy shares.

A recent trading statement caused consternation. Discussing the year to May 31, 2021, Frontier admitted that a newly released sequel to Elite Dangerous – Elite Dangerous: Odyssey – had had teething problems. The group also revealed that a new Formula 1 management game would be released later than expected, following Covid-related difficulties.

Market reaction was unforgiving. The shares slipped from £32.50 to today's price of £25.00. Yet Frontier's long-term prospects remain compelling.

The group is working to resolve issues around the new Elite game. Braben even apologised publicly to customers, and sales should bounce back over time. The Formula 1 game is likely to do extremely well too once it launches and there is a rich pipeline of new games expected over the next few years.

Analysts are optimistic about Frontier, forecasting a 20 per cent increase in sales to £91million for the 12 months to May 2021, rising to £143million in the current year. Profits of nearly £20million are expected for the year just gone, soaring to £33million in the year to May 2022.

Braben is highly focused on growth, so there are no dividends at the moment but payments may emerge over time, as Frontier has a healthy balance sheet and makes plenty of money.

Midas verdict: Gaming has become a multi-billion pound industry and Frontier Developments is a leader in the field, with international renown and reach. Recent glitches are being fixed, the group still has millions of loyal fans and Braben is committed to success. At £25.00, these shares should rise, with or without Tencent's help.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tough lockdown restrictions helped orders at food delivery giant Deliveroo double in the first half of the year.

Hungry customers who were unable to visit restaurants and pubs for much of the period ordered 148.8 million meals through the firm's app compared to 74.5 million during the same time last year.

Gross transaction value (GTV) also doubled from £1.7billion to £3.38billion as demand continued to remain strong even when curbs on eating out were loosened.

However, the London-based firm still made a massive pre-tax loss of £104.8million and has yet to make a profit since being set up by former investment banker Will Shu in 2013.

Lockdown boost: Hungry customers who were unable to visit restaurants and pubs for much of the period ordered 148.8 million meals through Deliveroo's app

Both the group's British Isles and international markets performed exceptionally well, with GTV in the former region up by over 200 per cent on their 2019 levels and 110 per cent higher than last year.

The newly-listed company also said it now has the largest number of active food merchants among food delivery businesses in the UK after adding around 10,000 new sites in the second quarter alone.

It recently expanded its partnership with the supermarket Waitrose and announced a tie-up with Sainsbury's, taking the number of grocery sites from which it delivers to around 4,600.

The American-born founder said: 'We have reported strong performance in the first half of the year and continued to make good progress in executing our strategy. As a result, I believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the huge opportunity ahead.

'We are seeing strong growth and engagement across our marketplace as lockdowns continue to ease. Demand has been high amongst consumers.'

Expansion: During the first half of the year, Deliveroo launched a tie-up with the supermarket Sainsbury's and expanded its partnership with Waitrose

But though the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated its orders, Deliveroo said the lockdown bounce is likely to ease off in the second half of the year.

The group's shares closed trading 6.1 per cent lower at £3.41 on Wednesday after rising significantly yesterday following the announcement that its German rival Delivery Hero had purchased a small stake in the online firm.

They flopped disastrously when they were listed on the London Stock Exchange earlier this year due to investor concerns about staff working conditions and the company's high losses.

It had hoped to sell shares for 390p each when it listed, but within just a couple of weeks, the share price hit a low of 225p. Since then, it has recovered much of that ground but still lags behind the initial optimism.

Troubles: Deliveroo made a pre-tax loss of £104.8million in the first half of 2021 and has yet to make a profit since being set up by former investment banker Will Shu eight years ago

Adam Vettese, an analyst at online investment firm eToro, warned that investors would 'eventually' want to see critics' concerns about the treatment of employees and profitability addressed.

'If Deliveroo can't do that, then it may find it a struggle to attract investors' cash, regardless of whether its numbers impress or not,' he remarked.

Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes Deliveroo's reliance on a 'gig economy model' makes it additionally vulnerable.

She said: 'So far, it's shaken off attempts to change the self-employed status of its riders in the UK but has pulled out of Spain due to legal changes requiring food delivery platforms to hire staff and not pay them as independent contractors.

'It could face further difficulties expanding globally if legislators elsewhere look again at workers' rights in the sector.'

Streeter added that Deliveroo's 'longer-term outlook depends on how demand holds up in a post-pandemic world, and if that road to profitability looks any clearer.'

The company's results come a day after it announced that Amazon's Vice President of Global Supply Chain, Devesh Mishra, has been appointed its next chief product and technology officer.

Deliveroo is already hiring another 400 people for new high-skilled technology jobs such as software engineers and data scientists to help strengthen its platform.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former pensions minister, Lord Myners, calls Vectura's decision to back the bid from Marlboro tobacco giant Philip Morris a 'garage sale' and one that stinks.

At Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, chief executive, Sarah Woolnough, says it's an outrage.

So do more than 20 other public health bodies, including the Royal College of Physicians, which have written to the board demanding it reject the deal, claiming that it is absurd that Philip Morris can make more money from providing treatments to the people they made ill in the first place.

Kicking the habit?: Should investors believe Philip Morris's stated ambition that it wants to buy Vectura as part of its switch away from tobacco

They also warn that Vectura's research capabilities and recruitment would be damaged by the association with big tobacco.

Even for the silly season of mid-August, emotional responses being provoked by Bruno Angelici's move to back the £1.1billion bid Philip Morris International over that from Carlyle, the private equity fund, are quite something to behold.

In the coming weeks, Vectura's investors will have to decide whether Angelici and his fellow directors are right to be selling out at 165p a share – a 10p premium to the rival Carlyle offer – or to reject the bid.

What should they do? Should they listen to the outraged medics who argue that handing over Vectura's inhalers business – devices created to deliver drugs for illnesses caused by cigarettes – would constitute nothing short of blasphemy? Or should they believe Philip Morris's stated ambition that it wants to buy Vectura as part of its switch away from tobacco, helping it with its long-term plan to be a wellness company. Is that credible? It's certainly a contrarian view and maybe not such a foolish one.

Randeep Somel, portfolio manager at M&G Investments, put the point well when he compared what Philip Morris aims to do by switching from tobacco to inhalers to how big oil has invested in renewables, as BP has done with solar and wind.

Like big oil, the tobacco giants have the capital to invest in new and healthier areas. It's also good business, as these companies know that regulations can only get stricter and they will have to find new areas of growth or wither away.

Shareholders have an alternative: reject the bid and allow Vectura to exist as an independent company. Such a route would be in line with the pressure being placed on asset managers – most recently from the PM and the Chancellor – to back the UK's long-term potential as part of an 'investment big bang' to boost growth and drive recovery.

Vectura has all the right credentials: founded by University of Bath students, it was a spin-out which then floated on AIM, and then graduated to the FTSE 250 Index as business grew fast in the respiratory disease market.

But if you dig a little deeper into Vectura's corporate history, you will see that lately it has not had the easiest of rides. It has gone through at least three mutations of its business model as its big pharma customers have switched from respiratory diseases into more lucrative areas of healthcare such as oncology.

Two years ago, Peel Hunt analyst Amy Walker described it as 'a cash stream in search of growth opportunities' and earmarked the company as a 'strategic takeover' with a target price of 122p on the stock.

Paradoxically, investors might take the view that despite the bizarre ethical situation, Vectura will help Philip Morris withdraw from its nasty addiction.

Great news for Tolkien fans. Middle-earth is moving back to the other side of the Earth, back to where Lord Of The Rings was first conceived, in rural Britain.

It's not yet known where in the UK the new series – which is set more than a 1,000 years before the books – is to be filmed. But wherever they are located, the sets are bound to become a massive tourist attraction as they have been in New Zealand.

On the move: Middle-earth is moving back to the other side of the Earth, back to where Lord Of The Rings was first conceived, in rural Britain

The move by Amazon to produce its next Lord Of The Rings TV series in the UK will bring a much-needed boost to the creative industries which have been so savaged by the pandemic. And it could be rather a nice boost too – Amazon is said to have spent $465m on the first series, which is due to be shown on Prime next September.

While Amazon is too politic to say so directly, industry sources suggest that Jacinda Ardern's tough, zero Covid policy has made filming impossible on several levels, despite the most generous grants.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@London's public markets remain red hot after a multi-billion-pound food business said it will list in the capital.

Olam Food Ingredients is looking to go public early next year in what will be one of the biggest floats in recent times.

The company will raise around £2billion from the float and immediately earn a place in the FTSE100.

Appetite: Olam Food Ingredients is looking to go public early next year in what will be one of the biggest floats in recent times

The decision by Olam is a big win for London as the City looks to attract more world-class companies post Brexit.

The London Stock Exchange had its strongest first half for listings in 2021 since 2014, but faces growing competition from the likes of Amsterdam.

The stock exchange is also under threat from private equity predators, snapping up companies whose valuations have been depressed during the pandemic.

As a result, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is trying to encourage a 'Big Bang 2.0' in the City and so far this year technology giants Deliveroo and Darktrace have come to market.

The float will also give London a much needed boost in the food and beverage space as Cadbury's, United Biscuits and Northern Foods have all been sold off over the past ten years.

Based in Singapore, Olam Food Ingredients works with some of the world's best-known food and drinks brands. It has 15,000 employee, operates more than 100 manufacturing plants, and sells cocoa, coffee, dairy, nuts and spice ingredients.

Anantharaman Shekhar, chief executive, said: 'The primary listing on the stock exchange will give us access to London's large and diverse investor base, with its deep and liquid capital markets, and enable us to benefit from its strong understanding of and research coverage across the food and beverage sector.'

In 2020 Olam posted revenues of £6.6billion and profits of £435m. It is majority owned by Temasek Holdings, Singapore's state-backed investment company, which holds a 53.2 per cent stake, with 15 per cent also held by Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation. It has appointed Citigroup, Credit Suisse, HSBC, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to work on the IPO.

Olam Food Ingredients was created in early 2020 after it de-merged from commodities giant Olam International.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nationwide is on a mission to lure in new current account customers, offering cash bribes of up to £125 to potential switchers.

Britain's biggest building society will pay £125 to existing members who switch their current account, while completely new customers will receive £100 for switching.

For switchers to be deemed a member and qualify for the more generous switching bribe, they will need to either hold a savings account or residential mortgage with Nationwide.

Members must use Nationwide’s Internet Bank to switch a current account they hold with another provider to an existing account they already hold with the Society or open a new account to switch to using Nationwide’s website, Internet Bank or Mobile Banking App.

Switches must be made using the Current Account Switch Service (CASS) and a minimum of two active direct debits must be set up on the new account.

For those who already have a Nationwide current account, they can still benefit, but they'll have to switch a current account over from another provider.

Tom Riley, director of banking and savings at Nationwide, said: 'We always look to reward our members' loyalty with exclusive products and services.

'This is why our new switching incentive offers a higher level of reward for existing members compared to those who are new to the society.

'We believe our mutual difference is the reason that the society continues to be one of the main winners of the Current Account Switch Service as people look for a provider that will not only offer a compelling account, but also one that has a strong focus on reward member loyalty.'

What's behind the cash incentive?

Nationwide has gained 590,255 more current account switchers than it has lost since the start of 2014 when the CASS began, according to analysis by MoneyComms.

This is more than any other current account provider. Santander, the next most successful provider, made a net gain of 323,483 during that time.

But, in the final six months of last year Nationwide lost 7,382 more customers in switches than it gained. For the first time since the CASS began, it recorded customer losses over consecutive three month periods.

Although it regained some ground in the first three months of this year, recording 1,474 switches, the society was still a long way short of both Starling Bank and Virgin Money, which made net gains in excess of 17,000.

Nationwide may therefore be hoping that its new cash incentive will enable it to return to its winning ways, particularly given the lack of competitive switching offers across the market as a whole.

Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts said: 'The switching offer from Nationwide is notable, especially as many current account providers pulled their own offers over the past few months.

'It could be timed to entice customers when there is little incentive to move elsewhere.'

What perks are other banks offering?

Cash bribes have been a rarity for current account switchers over the past year, and those that do appear are often short lived.

HSBC is currently dangling a £140 cash carrot in a bid to lure in new current account customers, albeit only until this Thursday.

Similarly, Virgin Money is offering joiners a £150 Virgin Experience Days gift card allowing its customers to choose between thousands of experiences from spa days and short breaks to sky diving.

Cash carrot: HSBC is offering current account switchers an £140 cash bribe until 19 August

Nationwide has not said when the incentive will expire, and its simple cash offer may make it more appealing to some than Virgin's voucher offering.

The offer applies to any one of Nationwide's three main current accounts. This includes its FlexDirect account, which pays 2 per cent interest on balances up to £1,500 and has a fee-free overdraft for the first 12 months, as long as customers pay £1,000 each month into the account.

Those unable to meet the £1,000 monthly requirement can opt for Nationwide's FlexAccount, which allows them to bank online and in branch for no fee.

For those seeking a more comprehensive package, the FlexPlus account includes worldwide family travel insurance, mobile phone insurance, UK and European breakdown cover and no transaction fees for using a debit card abroad – albeit for a fee of £13 per month.

However, whilst the cash bribe and choice of accounts might tempt many people to switch to Nationwide, there are other factors that experts say are also important to consider.

Starling Bank is rated as the number one provider for service levels, according to the latest annual survey by the consumer group, Which?

These include customer service, overdraft limits, interest rates, cashback, saving perks and an array of other niche benefits such as cinema tickets.

Starling Bank, for example, doesn't offer incentives to switchers, instead relying on the strength of its customer service and its app.

'Switching current accounts has many advantages, whether it be to acquire a perk or even to save money from a more cost effective overdraft tariff or to gain a better level of service,' said Springall.

'Customers may be better off picking an account with a package of benefits instead of choosing an account for its upfront perk, however. Incentives are only worthwhile if consumers make good use of them.'

Rudd, 74, has been dubbed The Man Who Sold Britain after flogging several major companies to overseas bidders. Meggitt is the latest – its board has agreed to an 800p-pershare offer from Parker Hannifin.

It faces a rival 900p offer from Transdigm, another US company. Rudd told The Sunday Times that if a suitor were to try to win the race for Meggitt on price alone, ministers would need to step in.

Adventurer said he wouldn't appear on reality TV today in 'age of social media'

Ben Fogle has revealed that he doesn't have 'tough enough skin' to take part in a reality show in the 'age of social media' after appearing on Castaway which kickstarted his rise to fame two decades ago.

The New Lives in the Wild presenter, 47, recalled his experience on the BBC reality show which saw him spend a year in Scotland battling the elements.

Speaking to The Express, he revealed that he wouldn't appear in a reality show today, adding: 'Would I do it today? Probably not. In 2021, I don't think I would want to appear on a reality TV show in the age of social media.'

'I don't think I have a tough enough skin to endure it.'

Ben Fogle has revealed that he doesn't have 'tough enough skin' to handle taking on another reality show in the age of social media after appearing on Castaway which kickstarted his rise to fame two decades ago.

Ben Fogle attend the "Survival Of The Species" photocall as part of the MIPCOM 2018 on October 15, 2018 in Cannes, France.

The adventurer had been working at Condé Nast for a year when the BBC announced the first reality show which Ben then applied to be a part of.

'It was very different to reality shows now, it was for a whole year and it had an innocence about it,' he explained. 'It was pre-social media and a much easier time to be a reality show contestant than it is today.'

After appearing on the show, which was his TV debut, Ben recalled how he suffered a breakdown.

'Back then, yes, I had a small wobble after I came off, but that was pretty short lived,' he explained.

He went on to admit that he would've still participated in the show if he knew of his struggles that would follow his experience - adding that he is 'pretty robust' - but said he wouldn't encourage his children to ' go out of their way to humiliate themselves on TV.'

It comes weeks after Ben told how he was 'bursting with pride' and hoped his children would gain ‘resilience and resourcefulness’ as they set off on a week-long trip to explore the Inner Hebrides.

The New Lives in the Wild presenter waved off his two children Ludovic, 11 and Iona, 10, who he shares with his wife Marina, at Euston station in London in July.

Alongside a sweet snap he posted on Instagram of the siblings with their backpacks on Monday, he penned: ‘I am bursting with pride as Ludo and Iona head off on their first big island adventure together to the Inner Hebrides.

‘When I was eight years old, I went on a trip to the island of Eigg (a visit that would change my life) and now these two are off with their adventure club and some friends on their own island expedition.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A dramatic turn of events during Sunday's Love Island has put four couples at risk of being dumped from the villa, including rocky Jake Cornish and Liberty Poole.

The islanders were sat enjoying an evening of romantic dinner dates when Toby Aromolaran received a text explaining that each pair must vote for two couples they consider the 'least compatible' - and submit their decision by text.

Following intense deliberations, it was revealed to the public which four couples are at risk of being dumped as a result of the tough vote.

Alongside Jake and Liberty, Teddy Soares and Faye Winters, Brett Staniland and Priya Gopaldas and Mary Bedford and Aaron Simpson face being dumped from the villa in a public vote.

The couples' fates not lying in the hands of the public and are therefore safe are Liam Reardon and Millie Court, Tyler Cruickshank and Kaz Kamwi and Toby and partner Chloe Burrows.

The islanders all appeared in agreement that following Jake and Liberty's 'rocky' week, their compatibility was starting to look doubtful.

And in an exclusive clip from Monday night's episode, things look like they are going downhill for Priya and Brett, after she confides in the girls that she finds him 'boring.'

'When he holds my hand, it feels like my dad holding my hand!' she admits to Kaz and Liberty.

She doesn't stop there, and after the girls advise her to 'friendzone' him, she reveals that she's 'got the ick.'

Elsewhere on Sunday night, Jake and Liberty faced yet another obstacle in their relationship - which resulted in Jake walking out of the villa.

Jake, 24, who confessed to Lib, 21, that he loved her, found out from Toby that the girls were doubting the sincerity of his feelings.

Toby told Jake that people were thinking his 'I love you' revelation was a 'cop out' to avoid the rocky week him and Liberty had just faced.

'I need to get out of this place!': Frustrated Jake stormed out of the villa on Sunday night after the girls doubted his feelings for Liberty

Growing increasingly frustrated, Jake snapped: 'I need to get out of this place.'

The water engineer stuck to his word and, despite a concerned Toby following him, he sat on a wall outside the villa to collect his thoughts.

The couple have been together since day one of this year's series, and have even made it official.

However Liberty had her doubts after it was revealed Jake wasn't sexually attracted to her in the movie night challenge, and continued to act icy towards her in the Villa.

The girls had earlier voiced their concerns about Jake's feelings to a smitten Liberty, who was delighted to tell the girls about her conversation with her beau in which he'd revealed he loved her.

Chloe Burrows responded to her frankly: 'You're going to hate me. Do you not think he's telling you what you want to hear?'

In the conversation with her pals, Liberty looked round at all of them to ask: 'Is that what you all think?'

To which Faye Winter tentatively replied: 'I don’t know baby.'

Supporting her friend: Faye told Jake in an honest chat that it was the 'worst' time he could tell her Liberty loved her

Liberty seemed a little confused, and asked for advice from her friends: 'Do you think I’m being an idiot?'

Chloe told the beauty: 'I don’t think he would say something if he didn’t mean it but I also think is it convenient that he said it this evening after all of this?'

Chloe and Faye were later pulled for a chat by Jake, who revealed to Toby and Teddy that he wanted to know 'who the f**k' had questioned his feelings for Liberty.

In an honest yet calm chat, Faye told him: 'Tonight was the worst time to tell her you loved her,' to which he replied, 'I totally understand.'

Once again, Jake and Liberty managed to iron out their issues.

Referring to his confession of love, Jake gushed to his girlfriend: 'I've been waiting to say those words for a long time.'

A more relieved-looking Liberty said: 'I trust you to believe that you meant it.'

It comes after Amy's mother Sue revealed how she found it difficult to even leave the house because of the constant questions from strangers about her daughter after her appearance on the hit ITV2 show in 2019.

During that summer's series, Amy's dramatic split from professional dancer Curtis Pritchard left her so devastated that she quit the show.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Sue, opened up about watching her daughter get dumped on the show, revealing that she wanted to 'get on the next plane and drag her out herself.'

'I didn't even feel that I could walk down the road. People were coming up to me and asking, ''How's Amy, is she OK?''', she said.

Fashion: Amy wowed in the fun blue and white floral ensemble

Candid: It comes after Amy's mother Sue revealed what it was like to watch her daughter have her heartbroken on national television (pictured: Amy with Sue and her grandmother)

The show demands that couple's share a bed with one another, and viewers speculated that Amy and her then half-boyfriend Curtis may have done more than cuddle, though the pair have both denied it.

When asked about watching her daughter be intimate on-screen, Sue said: 'At the end of the day, it's a TV show, and that's what it's there for. You kind of expect it.'

But their romance was short-lived when a stint in rival villa Casa Amor prompted Curtis to dump Amy, later coupling up Maura Higgins - who he dated for seven months.

Sue said that the producers of the ITV show kept in contact with her as her daughter's break up was playing out on screen, and that she would tell them to pass on the message that 'she can come home'.

After five weeks Amy walked out of the villa - a move that Sue believes was the best thing for her daughter's mental health.

Amy had therapy provided by ITV, and in an appearance on the Thank You Next podcast says that she explored feeling 'ugly' and a like 'failure' in her sessions since leaving the villa.

Amy also discussed how anxiety left her unable to enjoy her time after leaving the show, as people would constantly tell her that her new life 'wouldn't last'.

She said: 'Everyone said to me, from literally the day I got home, ''Well yeah, make the most of it because like it'll be over soon, yeah you gotta really milk it. Cos you've only got a year,'' and they said that really gleefully.

'They're like ''Yeah because obviously it's not gonna last forever, is it? So... you know you gotta make the most of it. Amy, are you making the most of it though because, you know, are you actually earning money?'''
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Picture it. Having settled for a staycation this summer, you’re finally contemplating a long-awaited trip to Europe. A New Year weekend away, a spring break or a skiing holiday.

Not so fast. While baffling traffic-light systems and quarantines will, hopefully, be history (or at least less complicated), Covid tests are likely to remain a requirement.

And now beleagured British travellers must face up to another source of expense and stress: the return of the roaming charge incurred when they use their mobile phones abroad.

Call costs: Beleagured British travellers must face up to another source of expense and stress: the return of the roaming charge incurred when they use their mobile phones abroad

When the charges were outlawed in the EU in 2017, travellers breathed an enormous collective sigh of relief.

So the move by two grasping telecoms companies, at a time when weary Britons are looking forward to new horizons again makes the heart sink.

It is an appalling backward step to the bad old days when unwary travellers would return home to shock mobile bills often running into thousands of pounds — sometimes more than the price of their holiday.

Maybe they’d used Google Maps to find their way around an unfamiliar city, oblivious to the data-hungry programme running in the background. Or downloaded a TV programme or a film. Or perhaps a games-addicted teenager on a family holiday was unable to go without their daily fix.

Whatever the cause, roaming was a recipe for truly terrifying tariffs.

Following that EU ruling in 2017, telecoms companies could no longer slap on exorbitant costs and were permitted only to charge customers using their mobile phones in another EU country the same as in the UK.

Brexit put an end to this arrangement, but all the big mobile operators denied they had any plans to exploit it. Now these reassurances turn out to be nothing more than cynical hot air.

To widespread fury, Vodafone has just announced that it intends to follow the lead of EE and resume roaming charges from January.

Vodaphone’s UK boss, Ahmed Essam, says the decision ensures ‘moving towards a fairer way to charge for roaming in Europe’.

He is fooling no one. This is not about ‘fairness’ at all.

Mobile phone giants are desperate to recoup the lucrative income stream they lost when roaming charges were scrapped. Too bad that it comes at the expense of their own customers.

The so-called justifications are flimsy, to say the least.

Vodafone, for example, puts forward two arguments, neither of them convincing.

First, it claims most of its customers are not regular roamers and don’t often use their phones abroad.

Therefore, they are being forced to pay for a service they don’t use, in order to subsidise the minority who do — at a loss to the company, it claims.

But if Vodafone is serious about this ‘cross-subsidy’ argument, then it has a duty to slash bills for the majority who do not roam. That won’t happen any time soon.

Second, the company pleads it needs huge sums for investment to improve provision to rural areas, ensure new security requirements and the roll-out of 5G.

Vodafone is a FTSE 100 company which made profits of £3.8 billion in the year to the end of March.

Admittedly, even for a business of this stature, the sums involved in the future telecoms network are huge. But it should not be financing its investment programme by gouging its own customers.

Anger: Vodafone and EE are bringing back roaming charges for people who use their mobile phones abroad

Higher phone bills are probably not much of a worry for chief executive Nick Read, who made £3.7 million in pay and incentives last year.

Rival network EE, the offshoot of former state-telecoms company BT, also claims it needs to bring back roaming fees to ‘support investment in our UK-based customer service and leading UK network’.

Again, it is true that BT and its infrastructure division Openreach have a huge investment programme on their hands. Yet this is cutting little ice with EE customers.

‘Nothing more than another cash grab,’ wrote one disgusted user on an EE online forum. ‘The fact you cannot roam anywhere in the world without getting robbed by your mobile carrier in 2021 is just poor.’

Another customer accused BT — which paid a hefty £12.5 billion to buy EE in 2016 — of using roaming fees as an easy way to recoup the money it spent on the takeover.

‘Wow. EE really know how to get their customers to hate them. It’s greed, plain and simple and I despise them for this,’ wrote a third.

These are not sentiments BT’s current boss Philip Jansen, a respected City figure, will be happy to hear.

Under his leadership the company made £1.8 billion profit last year, despite tough conditions. But the harsh truth is he inherited a very flawed business. Previous managements squandered billions of pounds buying football TV rights, overpaying for 3G licences and other follies.

Were it not for serial past incompetence, BT would be in a better financial position, and perhaps its customers would not be picking up the tab.

Similarly, critics point to a string of strategic errors over the past decade at Vodafone under previous bosses, including selling off the Japanese arm and then the U.S. business just before data use soared.

There have been controversies over its low tax bills in the UK and a £4.6 million fine in 2016 by regulator Ofcom uncovered mis-selling, inaccurate billing and poor complaints handling.

At present, EE proposes to charge a flat £2 a day fee for roaming. Vodafone will offer passes costing £1 a day and says the most anyone should end up paying is £2 a day.

Both companies are imposing the charges on new customers and those upgrading from January.

The upbeat Mr Essam claims ‘there will be no unexpectedly high bills’ because it will all be made clear in advance. ‘Everything will be easy to understand,’ he promises.

Even if we stretch credulity and accept this is the case, bringing back charges after promising the opposite is a disgraceful betrayal of trust.

The amounts proposed may not seem exorbitant, although £2 a day would still add up to £112 for a family of four on a two-week holiday.

But we shouldn’t be deceived. This is likely to be merely a toe in the water.

If telecoms companies get away with these charges, roaming bills will soon be pushing into the stratosphere once again.

Other big networks such as O2, Three, and Virgin say they have no plans to follow down this path — but that’s what Vodafone and EE said, too... right up until they reneged on that promise.

Ofcom, the regulator, should intervene before this spreads much further.

Whatever their commercial rationale, these companies made apparent promises they had no intention of keeping — and they should be made to pay for that, not their customers.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@If you want to give your finances a fresh start this year, the best and most important place to start is to try to clear any debt.

If you have a hefty balance sat on an old credit card, you will likely be clocking up interest of at eye-watering levels of 19-25 per cent.

A balance transfer card with a 0 per cent interest deal attached is a great tool if used correctly focus your repayments on clearing your balance, rather than covering interest.

The number of interest-free balance transfer deals on offer however has fallen to record lows as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and promotional terms are shortening as banks tighten lending. But the top deals currently waive interest for up to 28 months.

Interest freeze: An extended 0 per cent interest term can help borrowers clear their debts quicker

Those with short to medium-term debts can use such offers to finally get out of the red, while those with much more to repay can look to these cards to provide a lower cost alternative to their existing debts.

But beware: there are caveats to consider and barriers to overcome when applying for such cards (see box) below.

Many balance transfer cards also come with a 0 per cent period for new purchases as well.

Avoid the balance transfer credit card traps

The crucial thing to remember is that card companies aren't providing cheap credit as a favour.

They want you to not clear debts during the 0 per cent period and spend more on the card, which makes them money.

Avoiding falling into this trap is the key to balance transfer success.

Remember, you are trying to repay your debts, not build up more. So think hard before buying anything else with credit.

Work out how much you need to repay each month in order to clear the debt in time and set up a direct debit.

Beware, pay late or spend beyond your limit and you could have the 0 per cent promotion whipped away.

This is Money has compiled a selection of the best deals currently available in the balance transfer market.

THE SMALL PRINT: READ THIS BEFORE YOU APPLY Being approved for a balance transfer card is by no means guaranteed. In theory, those with the best credit ratings are the most likely to be approved for a card as they will have a history of paying off debt on time and have a stable income. It is more probable that those with poor credit ratings will be rejected. Those who are refused should bear in mind that applying for a number of other balance transfer cards in a short space of time will worsen their credit rating. Many card providers will not allow you to transfer balances from another of its own products, so you should identify the best deal for you outside of your existing providers before making an application. Some providers meanwhile may only accept your application if you already hold a current account with them. There are other restrictions you will also have to satisfy, such as having a minimum level of income (generally £10,000- £20,000 ). And to take advantage of introductory 0 per cent offers, you may have to transfer your balance within a specified time-frame. Most credit card providers increase handling fees after the first 60 or 90 days.

Completely 'free' balance transfer deals

For those confident they can pay off their credit card debts in a shorter time frame getting a balance transfer card with a lower handling fee, but lower interest-free period, can limit the extra charges on your debt.

Competition is tight though and there are a handful offering no handling fees at all with 0 per cent promotions just over two years.

Market leaders:

NatWest's Balance Transfer credit card offers 20 months interest-free with no fees, and comes with 0 per cent on purchases for the first three months.

However, balances must be transferred within the first three months of having the card and the 20-month clock starts ticking from the moment the card is issued. It comes with an APR of 19.9 per cent, and is only open to existing NatWest customers.

Santander's Everyday credit card offers 18 months 0 per cent interest with no handling fees, plus it has one advantage over rivals, it doesn't restrict the fee-free transfers to the first 60 or 90 days.

You can transfer a balance from another card free from handling fees for the duration of its 0 per cent interest offer - which lasts 18 months. You also get 3 months free purchases. The standard interest rate is 18.9 per cent.

Best low rate balance transfer credit cards

People who have racked up substantial credit card debt which is unlikely to be paid off within two years or who prefer to sidestep teaser rates can plump for cards which offer lower rates of interest.

Interest rates on these deals have jumped in recent months, however there are still some decent no-frills deals to be found.

Remember depending on how high your debts are you could also consider consolidating debts into a loan, particularly with borrowing rates at record lows at the moment.

If you choose a low rate credit card, you can currently find deals offering rates of 9.9 APR per cent.

Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland all offer cards with an APR of 9.9 per cent offering no-fee balance transfers if you shift your debts to them within the first 90 days.

Remember these deals are reserved for those with tip-top credit ratings and even if you are accepted you could be offered a higher interest rate of 16.9 APR per cent. Try using an eligibility checking tool first before you apply to see what your chances of being accepted are.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@I asked Virgin Media for a cheaper landline, TV, broadband and mobile phone deal in February.

I’d been paying £80 per month and was told this could be reduced to £64. But when the contract came through it was for £97 per month.

Instead, I used a switching website to move to TalkTalk — but my Virgin wall socket was incompatible, leaving me with no phone or broadband, so I cancelled the contract.

Nightmare switch: A reader, who was told her phone, TV and broadband bill would be reduced by £16 per month found herself paying £17 per month more after using a switching website

I am 87 and had no phone. A friend organised a temporary landline so I could talk to someone.

But TalkTalk would not cancel my contract as I had an outstanding bill. I paid the bill online and the following day an email arrived saying: ‘Welcome back to TalkTalk.’

Eventually I managed to cancel, but I seem to have lost the phone number I have had for 50 years.

Virgin then offered me a contract at £64 per month, but again, it came through at £97 and there will be a £65 installation fee.

Tony Hazell replies: I’ve had to take some details out of your letter, but the gist is that you were in a right old muddle.

This is hardly surprising: switching phone and broadband suppliers is fraught with pitfalls, not least losing your phone number even when you specify you want to keep it.

TalkTalk now accepts you could not have had a service if you did not have a connection or a socket. It has refunded everything you paid, waived the contract breakage fee and sent £40 as a goodwill gesture.

Virgin has credited £114 to your account and given you a cheaper contract, at less than £60 per month. But you have had to accept a new landline number. To keep a number, a port request must be sent, and something went wrong here.

Thankfully, everything else was resolved. But, at 87, surely you have the right to a decent deal without these shenanigans?

HMRC pinched £3,384.46 from my pension!

I took my pension tax-free lump sum three years ago and now draw £450 per month from it.

Two years ago, in July, I took an additional £10,000 lump sum, on which I paid £1,996 tax. On April 27 this year I did the same, but HMRC has taken £3,384.46!

My pension adviser and pension company say they cannot help me.

J. C., Stourbridge.

Tony Hazell replies: I was extremely surprised neither your financial adviser nor pension company seemed aware of the trap you’ve fallen into, as it has been well-publicised in the trade financial Press and Money Mail. Perhaps they don’t read the papers.

Basically, this problem arose because you took the money at the start of the tax year. HMRC has assumed your income for April will be maintained throughout the year and taxed you accordingly.

The good news is that you can request a repayment using the HMRC form P55. This can be submitted online or by post.

I spoke to HMRC and someone agreed to contact you. After this you both decided it would be simplest to reimburse you on your next pension withdrawal.

You should be owed around £1,400, but this may vary depending on how much you withdraw.

You may also want to ask your pension adviser what they are doing to earn their money.

Straight to the point Vueling owes me £229 for return flights between Cardiff and Palma that were cancelled during the pandemic. I have tried to contact the airline to no avail. W. T., via email. I, too, had to chase Vueling repeatedly for a response. But a spokesman has assured me you have been refunded and it is investigating the reason for the delay. *** My wife accidentally filled up her car with the wrong fuel. I am a member of the RAC, so called to ask for advice and was put through to a firm called Fuel Doctor. Someone came out to drain the tank, but I had to pay £274.99, even though its website says its prices start from £120. F. D., Fife. After I contacted the RAC, a spokesman ran a price check and says you would have saved only £50 by contacting Fuel Doctor directly. They added that you would have missed out on extra services, such as a free tow.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fleetwood Mac singer and keyboardist Christine McVie has become the fourth member of the legendary rock band to sell their back catalogue.

The Lancashire-born musician, 78, has sold her rights to future royalties from 115 songs to music IP investment company Hipgnosis, which also bought the back catalogue of the band's guitarist Lindsey Buckingham earlier this year.

Back in January, drummer Mick Fleetwood sold his publishing rights to music giant BMG, while fellow singer Stevie Nicks earned an estimated $80million to $100million from selling an 80 per cent share of her back catalogue in late 2020.

Songstress: McVie joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970 and has been behind some of the group's biggest-selling hits, including Don't Stop and You Make Loving Fun and Little Lies

It means bassist John McVie, Christine's former husband, is the only longtime member of the group to have not sold his publishing rights, though he has written few of the band's songs.

Hipgnosis co-founder Merck Mercuriadis said Christine McVie 'is one of the greatest songwriters of all time, having guided Fleetwood Mac to almost 150 million albums sold and making them one of the best-selling bands of all time globally.'

After a spell with blues band Chicken Shack, McVie joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970 and has been behind some of the group's biggest-selling hits, including Don't Stop, You Make Loving Fun and Little Lies.

The first two hits appeared on the Rumours album, one of the most famous music albums in history with over 45 million copies sold worldwide, while the latter appeared on Tango on the Night, which has sold 15 million copies.

McVie has also won two Grammy Awards, an Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 along with the rest of her bandmates.

The same year, she began a long hiatus from the band and lived - largely out of the limelight - in a small village in Kent before rejoining the group in 2014 for its On with the Show tour.

Dreams: Music fans have bought more than 150 million of Fleetwood's albums since its founding in 1967 by Mick Fleetwood (far right) and Peter Green, who died in July 2020

Mercuriadis, a former Elton John manager who co-founded Hipgnosis with Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers, noted that of the 16 songs on the band's Greatest Hits album, McVie - born Christine Perfect - had composed half of them.

He added: 'It's wonderful for us to welcome Christine to the Hipgnosis Family and particularly wonderful to reunite her once again at Hipgnosis with Lindsey Buckingham.'

Music fans have bought more than 150 million of Fleetwood Mac's albums since its founding in 1967 by Mick Fleetwood and Peter Green, who died in July 2020.

McVie's future husband John joined the band a few weeks after its first concert.

Fleetwood Mac's other major hits have included Go Your Own Way, Dreams, Tusk and The Chain. The latter has become well known in the UK for being the theme tune to television coverage of Formula One racing.

Song buyers: Nile Rodgers (left) and Merck Mercuriadis (right) are the founders of Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which owns the rights to songs by artists such as Shakira and Debbie Harry

McVie expressed elation with the sale, stating that she was 'thrilled that you all regard my songs worthy of merit. I'd like to thank you all for your faith in me, and I'll do all I can to continue this new relationship and help in any way I can!'

Hipgnosis did not reveal how much it spent purchasing McVie's rights, but the firm has raised over £1billion to buy the back catalogues of major artists such as Debbie Harry, Shakira, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

The large number of back catalogues acquired in recent years has been compared to a music gold rush, as investors spend ample sums grabbing the rights to music royalties that they hope will provide a stable long-term source of income thanks to streaming.

It can also be a way for musicians to earn one last big payday. Bob Dylan scored an estimated $300million when he sold his back catalogue of 600 songs, including Blowin' in the Wind and Knockin' on Heaven's Door, to Universal Music Group.

Dolly Parton and Ozzy Osbourne are considering selling their back catalogues, while Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher has said he could sell his for as much as £200million and use some of that money to buy a superyacht.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As investment funds dived in the first three months of 2020, FP Argonaut Absolute Return managed to deliver a 23 per cent return to investors.

Absolute return funds are meant to do what they say on the tin and make money for investors in the bad times as well as the good, but many have been left disappointed over the years.

This time round, the Argonaut fund pulled the trick off and then some in the first quarter of the year when it became the top-performing fund.

On this episode of the Investing Show, we speak to manager Barry Norris to ask him how the fund not only weathered the storm but turned a big profit – and what he is investing in now.

As an absolute return fund manager, he is free to invest in almost anything he likes and can go both long and short of companies - backing those he things will do well and selling those he thinks will suffer.

This is definitely a 'don't try this at home' school of investing and it is often the case that absolute return funds carry high fees and relatively low returns.

Argonaut Absolute Return certainly has a high ongoing charges figure, compared to a standard investment fund, of 2.26 per cent.

It is up 21 per cent year-to-date and has returned 30 per cent over one year, 46 per cent over three years, but just 15.1 per cent over five years.

Those figures compare to sector averages of - 3.9 per cent year-to-date and -1.2 per cent, -0.6 per cent and 2.7 per cent over one, three and five years, respectively.

Barry explains how he thinks the recovery will unfold, what shape it will be and why he decided to buy shares in Zoom last November. He also discusses why an investor would consider buying into an absolute return fund after the market has crashed and its protective cloak may no longer feel necessary.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Studies show that dividends paid out and reinvested are the key to long-term stock market total returns, but should you invest for income, growth or a mix of the two?

‘It’s not just about high yield, it’s about owning companies with dividends that we think can steadily grow into the future’, says Troy Income & Growth co-manager Hugo Ure.

This style of investing can deliver both a decent and solid income and companies that can see their share price rise over time, he argues.

Troy Income and Growth predominantly invests in UK companies and currently yields 3.2 per cent – below the market’s 4 per cent – but has grown its annual payout by 5 per cent on average over the past five years.

On this episode of the Investing Show, Hugo discusses how he looks for the best income and growth opportunities, how to avoid value traps when weighing up high yield stocks and some of the companies he thinks can produce robust and growing dividends in years to come.

Among the trust’s top ten holdings are some familiar big gun names, including Unilever, Lloyds and Shell, but Hugo also talks us through some of the lesser-known names, such as Sabre Insurance, which insurers non-standard drivers and operates in a niche in which it can continue to grow.

Troy Income and Growth trust has ongoing charges of 0.91 per cent and a total return of 43.7 per cent over the past five years, well ahead of the AIC’s average UK Equity Income trust’s 33.2 per cent, but only just in front of Vanguard’s UK All Share index tracker’s 42.95 per cent.

The year has begun with talk that the Bank of England could be about to cut interest rates. Is this really likely to happen at the start of 2020 and what would be the benefit? Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter discuss the prospect.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Do you care where you invest, or are you just worried about making money?

For many investors, the latter tends to be more of a concern than ethically targeted investing.

But what about if caring about where you invest could make you more money?

That could potentially be the case for those who back impact investing, a concept that is still niche but gathering a head of steam in the investment world.

It is the next step on from socially responsible and ethical investing and involves investing in companies and ventures with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.

But what does that mean to the ordinary investor? Tim Crockford, of the recently-launched Hermes Impact Opportunities fund, joined us on the Investing Show to explain.

He outlines how the fund looks for businesses that can contribute and benefit to eight key themes, ranging from water, to energy transition, education and future mobility.

Impact investing backs companies and organisations shaping our future, which could range from water sustainability, to health and electric car infrastructure

These are the themes that are likely to define the next 20, 30 or 50 years and so impact investing is essentially an investment in the future.

And as these are major issues for the world and individual countries, it is possible for investors to benefit from the companies that governments expect to step in and move us towards elements such as electric cars and charging, improving health and wellbeing and transforming the energy system to a low carbon one.

US shares are trading at expensive valuations, almost all assets have had a good run in recent years and even that eternal laggard the UK stock market has hit a series of record highs - shaking off the struggles of earlier this year,

This means that investors need to become more selective if they want good returns in the months and years ahead, says Tom Becket, chief investment officer of Psigma Investment Management,

On this episode of the Investing Show, Tom joins Simon Lambert, of This is Money and Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, to explain why he believes investors need to divide their thinking into short and long-term opportunities - and gives us three examples of where he believes those may lie.

In the short-term, Tom says that oil and gold mining firms may offer a chance for profit, with firms having trimmed their costs and become more efficient but their shares have lagged behind the commodity.

In the long-term, he sees India as having the potential to deliver good returns and explains what he learned from a recent visit there - and why funds with managers with good contacts on the ground there are the best option.

The online retailer is owned by the billionaire Barclay family, whose interests include The Telegraph newspapers and Yodel.

Very has benefited from the boom in online shopping and it is understood advisers have been hired to look into a float.

The company's most recent results to the year ending June 2020 show revenue up 2.9 per cent, to £2billion, with a profit of £48million, against a £185million loss the previous year.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Just when you thought that you could book to go back in the water.

As if sorting a holiday, ensuring the country you want to go to is okay for long enough to get there, or dodging quarantine roulette wasn't enough, now car hire inflation is biting.

In a sign of the inflationary times, the cost of renting a car has rocketed to about three times the price of last year and it's being blamed on the semiconductor shortage.

How can a lack of computer chips drive up costs so substantially at the car hire desk? And what on earth has this got to do with the price of a bag of crisps?

On this week's podcast, Georgie Frost, Grace Gausden and Simon Lambert look at holidays and inflation and the points where supply and demand are intersecting to create very odd scenarios, plus Simon expands on his crisp-based inflation explanation.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Home buyers are engaged in a last minute race to beat the stamp duty deadline – with some facing a potential double false economy.

House prices have bounced 10 per cent over the past year meaning that the £15,000 maximum saving of a year ago on a £500,000 home would now come on a property that potentially costs £50,000 more.

That has led to claims of a false economy, but it would be doubly so for any buyer who then missed the deadline too and ended up with an extra £12,500 tax bill as they only get the tapered bit of the stamp duty holiday not the whole thing.

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Lee Boyce and Simon Lambert look at the last minute stamp duty rush and what might happen next to the property market, with Simon outlining that it’s not just a tax cut driving the pandemic boom.

At the other end of the property ladder, the team look at how to make sure you don’t end up paying off a mortgage in retirement and what you can do if you are approaching your pension years or in them with a home loan still to clear.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The Budget this week was notable for two things: Firstly, The Chancellor decided to delay settling the coronavirus bill to another day and, secondly, the true scale of the women's underpaid state pension scandal was laid bare at £3billion.

The collossal short-changing of married women on their state pensions was uncovered by This is Money columnist Steve Webb and journalist Tanya Jefferies just over a year ago.

Their investigations, campaigning and tenacity has paid off and now women affected should get what they are owed - to the tune of an astonishing £3billion, according to Budget documents.

Tanya joins Georgie Frost, Lee Boyce and Simon Lambert to explain the issue on this week's podcast, as the team also trawl through the Budget to explain what it means for people.

One day Britain might have to try to balance the books and pay the bill for the coronavirus rescue, but that day didn't arrive with the Budget.

The Chancellor Rishi Sunak openly indulged in some stealth taxation by freezing personal allowances and income tax thresholds in the future and said corporation tax would rise, but kept the cash flowing to aid economic recovery.

Furlough was extended, there will be an encore at the stamp duty holiday party, the business investment of Eat Out to Help Out was launched, and a new 5% deposit mortgage scheme has been launched (without being called Help-to-anything, so that's something at least).

The self-employed also got some more help, with new entrepreneurs getting assistance, but bizarrely those who previously earned more than £50,000 as sole traders and paid lots of tax are still left out in the cold.

The tax burden is set to rise but this was no austerity Budget and Britain's debt and deficit are scarily big.

So will Rishi's third Budget in a year be what Britain's economy needs to achieve escape velocity as lockdown eases (and hopefully never comes back)?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In case you hadn’t noticed, Bitcoin went on bit of a tear recently. And as the price of the leading cryptocurrency soared again, so did the number of stories written about it.

Bitcoin is an interesting tale, a welcome diversion in a Covid-bound world, and the circus around cryptocurrency is the gift that keeps on giving for journalists.

But the vast majority of those column inches focus on two things: bitcoin’s price and should you invest?

A question that’s not so much asked is what should you do if you’ve reaped handsome profits on bitcoin or another cryptocurrency?

Should you cash in those gains or – to combine a couple of crypto phrases - hodl on the basis that it really could go to the moon?

(Where that moon is and when it’s been reached is as yet undefined.)

On this week’s podcast, we dive into the story of a This is Money reader and listener who told us about what it’s really been like to hold bitcoin long-term and how although he’s not quite got Lamborghini money, he did buy a Skoda and pay off some of his mortgage.

Georgie Frost, Lee Boyce and Simon Lambert also look at the rival cryptocurrencies to bitcoin and Argo Blockchain, the small UK listed company that’s come from nowhere to place among investors top recent share buys.

On a more pedestrian note, the team also discuss inflation-beating savings accounts and where they can be found – spoiler alert, don’t get too excited – and property guardians: would you live in an empty building for cheap rent?

Does that mean the inevitable return of the car, or with the Government promising billions to create a new era for cycling and walking, is there a brighter and greener future for mobility?

Meanwhile, the car industry has been rocked by Covid-19, with job losses aplenty and sales grinding to a halt.

Registrations sank 89 per cent to the record-lowest May since 1952, but despite that, sales of electric vehicles were up 22 per cent – and the Tesla Model 3 was the best seller.

Could it be time to head to a showroom to haggle a bargain, will there be yet another scrappage scheme and why has Fiat launched a pay-as-you-go model of ownership?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An army of enforcers will start knocking on the doors of thousands of vulnerable pensioners from next month demanding they pay £159 for their previously free TV licence – or face the ultimate threat of jail.

Masquerading as 'customer care' personnel, they are on a mission to track down more than a quarter of a million over-75s who have yet to pay for their TV licence.

Once they get their foot in the door, they will order pensioners to pay up. Failure to pay the bill could lead to prosecution, a £1,000 fine and prison if payment is not forthcoming.

These looming doorstep attacks follow the scrapping of the free TV licence for over-75s by the BBC last August.

Many pensioners, who haven't paid for their TV licence, will be contacted by debt enforcers

Despite the fact that nine out of ten of the four million pensioners have already paid for a licence, 260,000 are standing firm. Many of them are vulnerable, live alone and are surviving on incomes of less than £180 a week.

Some are furious that their right to a free licence has been taken away without any proper consultation while others simply cannot afford to pay.

By law, a licence is required to watch any TV live on any channel.

Retired bookmaker Colin James, 82, from Wolverhampton, is furious that he has been asked to pay for his TV licence.

On Friday, he told The Mail on Sunday: 'The BBC is giving us a load of old codswallop about how it needs our money – while frittering away a fortune on obscene salaries that those who fund it can only ever dream of.'

He added: 'Having paid for a TV licence my whole life with the promise of it being free in old age, the BBC has suddenly changed the goal posts. Does it have a magic switch to turn my TV off? It can bully all it wants, it can send round the heavies, but I'm not paying.'

The total amount the BBC could potentially receive from the 260,000 targeted victims adds up to just over £40million.

This is equivalent to the cost of 52 BBC presenters currently earning more than £150,000 a year – plus the salaries of as many as 100 'senior leaders'.

Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is the highest paid – earning £1.36million a year, and this is after a £390,000 pay cut.

The BBC already enjoys annual revenue of more than £3.5billion from TV licences. Further income from media sales tops this up to almost £5billion.

The decision to start knocking on the doors of pensioners follows a series of 'please act now before your licence is cancelled' and 'gentle reminder' letters sent out in recent weeks. But the letters also forewarn of enforcement officers arriving if they fail to pay.

Threat: TV Licensing's letter warning debt collectors will be called in if the fee is not paid

Retired 82-year-old printer Johnnie Carslake, from Norfolk, says: 'The BBC can take me to court – and get me thrown into jail. I am making a stand and refuse to pay the fee. We had a legal deal for a free licence that the BBC has now broken.'

Jan Shortt, general secretary of campaign group National Pensioners Convention, points out that it is not just a broken promise leading many people to refuse to pay. Some 60,000 pensioners, she says, do not have the cash.

Shortt warns: 'Many people have a hard decision to make this year – whether they turn on their heating or pay for a TV licence. For many vulnerable people, the television provides comfort and company.

'We estimate at least 60,000 are surviving on perhaps £180 a week or less and are just above the threshold that would allow them to claim Pension Credit – and be eligible for a free TV licence.

'With soaring heating bills and rising council taxes, people will be forced to decide if they can still afford this basic luxury or must forgo their TV to keep their home warm.'

She adds: 'We would never encourage people to break the law, but we can fully understand the decision made by those that are refusing to pay. We respect the stance they are taking.'

An estimated 1.5million households are eligible for a free TV licence because they receive Pension Credit – but only about 800,000 people have applied.

Costly: Many pensioners will not be able to afford the TV licence, experts have said

If you are above State pension age and earn less than £173.75 a week as a single person, or £265.20 a week as a couple, then Pension Credit will top your income up to these levels.

Terry Clohosy, a retired tool maker from Essex, only received a free TV licence for six months before the BBC decided to take it away from him.

The married 77-year-old says: 'I have been getting a letter every month for the last year demanding I pay up. Then this month I received a letter adopting a more softly-softly approach.

'That was until the end of the letter when it stated that if it had not heard from me by August, "your address will be passed on to Romford Enforcement Division for investigation".

'It is disgraceful behaviour. If my mother – who died a few years ago in her 90s – had received such a letter, she would have been reduced to tears.'

The Mail on Sunday visited the swanky £1billion renovated offices of Broadcasting House in Central London last September, armed with hundreds of readers' letters complaining about the scrapping of the free over-75s licence.

We asked the BBC for a meeting with the new £525,000-a-year Director-General Tim Davie so we could hand over the correspondence.

We also wanted to make it clear that there was a growing rebellion among many pensioners refusing to pay – and that it could end up with the BBC spending vast sums of money on debt collectors to collect the fees. Our request was ignored.

The BBC is cloaking its attack on pensioners with phrases such as 'customer care visits' and is promising that there will be no 'record of interview' – meaning there will not be a prosecution if someone initially fails to pay the fee.

It also claims it will use 'members of staff who are specially trained in assisting older customers' to visit pensioners.

But the fact remains that a failure to toe the line and hand over the £159 will ultimately end in prosecution. Incidentally, no one is obliged to let the debt collectors into their homes.

On Friday, the BBC told The Mail on Sunday: 'Now that the transition period is over, our focus is to continue to support everyone to become correctly licensed.

'We appreciate some of the small group who have not yet made arrangements may have concerns about being able to pay, which is why we have written to them and will shortly be undertaking customer care visits, carried out by specially trained staff.

'There are a range of payment options to help with this, including options to spread the cost.'

Investec raised the rate on its Online Flexi Saver this week to 0.58 per cent on a minimum £5,000 investment, while Paragon Bank’s new Limited Edition Easy Access pays 0.46 per cent on £1 or more.

There are also providers paying up to 0.6 per cent, but these accounts often come with a catch.

Savings rates on easy-access accounts have crept up to 0.6 per cent for the first time in nine months

Some include a bonus which makes the rate look better. This usually lasts for a year before disappearing to leave you earning as little as 0.1 per cent unless you move your money.

Others restrict how often you can take money out and charge savers if they exceed their limit.

But they can offer a better deal for savers with cash they don’t need to access urgently.

Money is still pouring in to easy-access accounts, while the amount in current accounts also soars.

Savers have £943.8billion sitting in easy-access accounts, according to the Bank of England’s figures.

The average rate earned is 0.1 per cent. There is also £242billion in current accounts earning no interest.

Meanwhile, the amount in fixed-rate bonds has fallen by nearly 10 per cent to £150billion. Skipton Building Society’s Triple Access Saver pays 0.6 per cent.

But you are limited to three withdrawals a year and you have to keep a minimum of £5,000 in the account. If you make further withdrawals, you must close the account. It is available online, through its branches, by post and you can open it over the phone if you have a working email address.

Coventry BS’s new LimitedAccess Saver (Online) pays 0.55 per cent but you can make six free withdrawals a year. You can make more but there is a charge equal to the amount of 50 days interest — or 75p per £1,000. The society runs a similar account through its branches, paying 0.5 per cent.

Skipton Building Society’s Triple Access Saver pays 0.6 per cent. But you are limited to three withdrawals a year and you have to keep a minimum of £5,000 in the account

Accounts with bonuses paying 0.5 per cent or 0.6 per cent include online deals from Cynergy Bank, Leeds BS, Saga, Tesco Bank and Marcus by Goldman Sachs. There are no withdrawal restrictions on these.

Cynergy Bank raised its Online Savings rate to 0.6 per cent last week. It includes a 0.3 percentage point bonus payable for one year.

After this, the rate falls to 0.3 per cent. Tesco’s new Internet Saver at 0.5 per cent includes a bigger 0.4 point bonus for 12 months.

Leeds BA Limited Online Access account pays 0.5 per cent but only until August 31 next year.

If you don’t want to have to worry about moving your money when the bonus runs out, the best value comes from Marcus by Goldman Sachs.

The bonus is 0.1 per cent for a year and means your rate will only drop to 0.4 per cent after.

Ministers were yesterday under pressure to pay compensation to Football Index victims following claims the Government-backed regulator failed to protect customers.

The betting website, which styled itself as a 'stock market for footballers', went bust in March leaving fans with £90 million of open bets.

The Gambling Commission was accused of being 'asleep at the wheel' after it admitted the collapse followed a ten-month probe. Its actions are being investigated by an independent review expected to report next month.

Football Index customers have hired lawyers and want the Government to compensate them.

Matt Zarb-Cousin, director of Clean Up Gambling who supports the victims, said: 'If the inquiry finds the commission culpable, then unless Football Index users are compensated by the Government they will have been treated as collateral damage.'

Andrew Rhodes, boss of the Gambling Commission, said that it could not be blamed for the collapse as 'being regulated does not prevent a company going into administration.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@An increasing number of Britons used buy now, pay later schemes during the pandemic as people turned to online shopping during successive lockdowns, a new report shows.

One third of adults have now used a buy now, pay later product, according to the consumer group, Which? and two in five of those have done so in the last year.

The BNPL sector allows shoppers to pay for goods in interest-free instalments or after purchasing an item, often using informal credit agreements.

The Which? report included extensive in-depth profiling of typical users of buy now, pay later providers such as Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy.

The value of spending made through these payment methods, more than tripled between January and December last year.

There are concerns people are being offered a false sense of security about their financial situation due to lax affordability and credit checks conducted by BNPL firms.

More than a quarter of those who have used BNPL credit in the last 12 months doubt they would be able to cover an unexpected expense of about £500.

And while four in five BNPL shoppers have never missed a repayment, shoppers using smaller BNPL firms are more likely to have fallen behind, according to the research.

Almost a third of those who have used a smaller BNPL provider have missed a payment. Familiar names in the area include Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy.

'BNPL has become a popular form of short term credit and can be a cost effective alternative to expensive overdraft and credit cards if used sensibly,' said Andrew Hagger personal finance expert at Moneycomms.

'Like any form of credit there will be people who fail to repay on time, not because they deliberately set out to do so, but due to a change in their personal circumstances.'

Which? estimates that a third of the UK adult population have used a buy now, pay later product.

Which? also found that some people are using BNPL to access credit at stressful and challenging times in their lives and may be experiencing harmful consequences as a result.

Those aged 39 or younger were more likely to report having missed a BNPL repayment, while three quarters of those who had missed a payment had experienced a challenging life event in the last 12 months.

Missing a credit repayment or bill increases the odds of using BNPL by 38 per cent, whilst experiencing a major life event - such as getting married, having a baby, moving home or being made redundant - increases the odds by 35 per cent.

It was also shown that those with dependent children are 71 per cent more likely to have used a BNPL product.

Which? found that BNPL was not limited to younger age groups or those with lower incomes.

Missing a credit repayment or bill or experiencing a major life event increases the odds of using buy now, pay later by around a third.

Those with household income of between £10,000 and £50,000 were 50 per cent more likely to use a BNPL product than those with a household income of less than £10,000.

'Our research challenges the stereotype of buy now, pay later as a product used by Gen-Z and millennials and shows it is also popular with more affluent consumers, people with families and those who are facing financially challenging times,' said Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?.

'Our findings raise concerns that buy now, pay later users might not be fully aware of the financial commitment they are signing up to - putting them at risk of accumulating a big debt.'

What are the risks of BNPL?

Regular BNPL shoppers are at risk of spending beyond their means, which could result in financial difficulties in the future if not managed effectively.

'If you use it frequently, there's the danger that you'll lose track of the total amount you've borrowed across a range of retailers and the cumulative monthly repayments could put your finances under pressure,' said Hagger.

'Ask yourself if you really need the product before clicking the buy now button? Leave it a day - sleep on it and if you're still sure the next day then go ahead, but try to avoid impulse purchases without checking you can afford it.

'Also question whether you are 100 per cent sure you will be able to repay without incurring any missed payment fees?'

What needs to be done to better protect people?

Experts believe BNPL firms should be more transparent about the risks of using their services and provide upfront information about late fees and what people can expect if they miss a payment.

'All fees should be made very clear before the person signs up for their BNPL together with a warning of how a missed payment could have serious consequences for your longer term finances and the ability to obtain credit,' said Hagger.

'There should also be rigorous affordability checks and all borrowing requests should be subject to a credit search - this would flag up those who are taking out multiple BNPL deals and possibly facing financial pressure down the line.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Vectura's board faced criticism after it backed a takeover offer from the maker of Marlboro cigarettes.

The decision sparked outrage among the UK's medical chiefs and physicians who were shocked that the inhaler maker, which helps people with respiratory problems, could succumb to US tobacco giant, Philip Morris International (PMI).

City grandee Lord Myners last night also condemned the deal, branding it a 'garage sale' and saying the bid saga 'stank'.

Appalled: City grandee Lord Myners, a former chairman at Marks & Spencer, branded the Vectura deal a 'garage sale', saying the bid saga 'stank'

Vectura's board accepted the offer on financial grounds as it values the firm at £1.02billion. This is more than a bid of £958million from US private equity firm Carlyle.

Myners is a former chairman at Marks & Spencer who saved the company from falling into the hands of Philip Green.

He said the chairman and directors of Vectura should never have engaged with either of the takeover offers.

'The board should have rejected the first offers, instead they put their head in the noose. Boards in this country lack stomach to produce better long term value.

It is a fact of life now, any UK cash offer [at a premium] above 30 per cent and the investment banks tell the board to accept. Game over.'

He added: 'It doesn't happen in other countries. It's like a garage sale. We are selling off our scientific leadership. It's a tragedy and the Government just watches as all our scientific knowledge is bought up.'

Founded in 1997 by students from the University of Bath, Vectura is one of the UK's leading science companies.

Philip Morris wants to get its hands on the firm to transform itself into a 'health and wellness' firm. Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said they were 'extremely shocked and concerned'.

She added: 'PMI makes billions from making addictive products that can cause and exacerbate lung diseases. It's totally absurd that they could make more money from providing treatments to the very people they have made ill in the first place.'

Vectura shareholders will vote on the deal on August 24.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@We've all been there. It's late at night on a 'smart' motorway with relatively little traffic. No visible sign of any problem. But approaching the next overhead gantry, you notice the speed limit is showing 40 mph.

So you slow down, fearing trouble ahead. Yet for mile after mile there's nothing. No accident. No roadworks. No incident. Other drivers are becoming frustrated and beginning to put their foot down.

Soon, massive juggernauts are trundling inches from your rear bumper or overtaking at speed as you stick to the 40 mph limit. Yet it feels increasingly unsafe to do so.

Safety concerns: 'Smart' motorways constantly monitor traffic and automatically reduce speed limits to avoid localised jams and shut down lanes in the event of an accident

It is truly scary. I have been in that situation more than once. Motoring organisations the AA and RAC are aware of it, too. It's just one of their list of concerns about so-called 'smart' motorways.

RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: 'Smart motorway signage is not always being switched off after incidents have been cleared, resulting in some drivers sticking to previous 40 mph limits, while others are rocketing past at 70 mph. Drivers need to be able to trust the motorway signs.'

Anyone who has been on the M4 motorway in recent years will also know the frustration at the seemingly never-ending 50 mph speed limit — policed by average-speed cameras — as it is upgraded to 'smart' motorway status.

The AA and RAC say aspects of digital motorways are simply 'not so smart'.

Delays: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is still sitting on several key evaluation reports on smart motorway safety

MPs on the Commons Transport Committee have even delayed their report into smart motorway safety until early autumn because key evidence from unpublished Highways England safety evaluation reports is still sitting with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.

So what exactly are smart motorways and why are they causing concern?

Transport ministers want cost-effective ways to increase road capacity — getting more vehicles flowing more freely and safely on the same amount of road.

Their high-tech solution was the 'smart' motorway — constantly monitoring traffic and automatically reducing speed limits to avoid localised jams and shut down lanes in the event of an accident.

Overhead gantries and large roadside information signs warn of queues, speed limits, closed lanes and diversions.

To ensure compliance, advanced speed cameras with number-plate recognition police the system with the threat of fines and penalty points on the licence.

An early version with variable speed limits started on the M25 in 1995, with a pilot smart motorway on the M42 in 2006.

The programme accelerated from 2014 with the first All Lane Running (with no hard shoulder and variable speed limits).

However, the decision to take over the hard shoulder at peak times or remove it altogether has become a controversial element that has been blamed for a number of fatalities.

AA president Edmund King said: 'The danger of breaking down in a live lane comes when you can't get to a refuge area. Some 38 per cent of breakdowns occur in a live lane on a smart motorway.'

A section of the M3 smart motorway near Camberley in Surrey. The motorways have no hard shoulder for emergencies, and use technology to close off lanes

The long distances between these areas is 'a fundamental flaw' in 'smart' motorway design, he says.

Only after pressure from the AA did the Government pledge to place the refuges no more than one mile apart, but the existing network still has them spaced 1.5 miles apart.

Average spacing is 1.2 miles — or 72 seconds at 60 mph — which is a challenge if your car has given up the ghost.

Highways England says it will 'continue to consider' retrofitting extra emergency areas on existing smart motorways where they are more than one mile apart, with a decision to be made by April next year.

One catalyst for change was the death in 2018 of Nargis Begum, 62, from Sheffield, who was killed after her car broke down on a section of the M1 with no hard shoulder.

All you need to know There are three different types of smart motorway: Controlled motorways have three or more lanes, variable speed limits and a hard shoulder for emergency use only.

Dynamic hard shoulder (DHS) motorways have variable speed limits and a hard shoulder that can be opened up to traffic at busy times when overhead signs tell you that it is allowed.

All Lane Running motorways have variable speed limits, no hard shoulder and an emergency refuge area roughly every 1.5 miles or every mile. Overhead signs show a red X if a lane is closed — and you now face a fine and penalty points if you ignore it.

Hearings heard that 16 minutes elapsed between her Nissan breaking down and the crash near Woodall services. It took a further six minutes before warning signs were activated.

In February this year, the coroner said Highways England should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for potential manslaughter charges, though the government-owned company denied having committed any offence.

Mr King said: 'In the pre-inquest hearing into the M1 fatality of Mrs Begum, the coroner was informed that between seven and eight staff in the regional control centre would watch over 450 CCTV cameras for the Yorkshire and North East region, of which 287 CCTV cameras specifically overlook the 'smart' motorway sections. This means staff are looking across more than 55 cameras each.'

That is changing, says Highways England, which is committed by September 2022 to retrofitting radar Stationary Vehicle Detection (SVD) systems to all existing All Lane Running motorway. Every new smart motorway will have radar SVD technology in place upon opening.

By September of next year, Highways England says it will also upgrade its enforcement cameras to automatically detect vehicles passing illegally under a red X or entering the lane beyond one, where drivers face fines and penalty points.

Although smart motorways are designed to reduce congestion, a third of drivers don't use the inside lane because they are worried about breakdowns ahead, and so capacity is reduced.

Public confidence in using smart motorways is at an all-time low, says the AA, with its own polling showing more than half (56 per cent) of drivers saying the smart motorways project should be scrapped and the hard shoulder reinstated.

The AA wants the Government to convert all motorways to 'controlled' motorways (with a hard shoulder and overhead gantries), where it says the fatality rate is 'significantly lower'.

Highways England says: 'We recognise that fears have continued to be raised about smart motorways and, in particular, the impact that removing the hard shoulder has on driver safety. So we are taking action, and also accelerating measures to help road users feel safer on them.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anthony Scaramucci is best known for his brief but memorable role as President Trump's director of communications, but he has also had a much longer and equally as colourful career in the investment industry.

'The Mooch', as he became known during his 11-day stint at the White House, worked at Goldman Sachs in the 1980s and 1990s, but then went on to found Oscar Capital Management and later the investment firm SkyBridge Capital.

In a new interview, Scaramucci fondly remembers his investment in a tequila brand: 'I think I was 15 to one on that investment. We put it in the HBO show Entourage, it caught fire, and then we sold it to the French spirits company Bernard, I think it was called. That was an incredible investment.'

But with the benefit of hindsight and significantly more humility, Scaramucci also now recalls at the height of his 'investment arrogance' one of his worst investments to date among a 'series of losers' that all investors will suffer.

Anthony Scaramucci reveals his worst investment came during his time at Goldman Sachs at the 'height of [his] investment arrogance'

'I was 27, and for some reason, I decided that I knew more about biotechnology than biotechnology people or scientists or medical doctors. I obviously know everything.

'And so, I had the worst thing that can happen to you, I bought these call options on a biotech company. And they exploded to the upside,' he told Interactive Investor's Family Money show.

That meant that Scaramucci was initially well up on his investment, but then disaster struck.

He said: 'So that fortified me with great confidence about what a genius I was. And so, I doubled down, as this company was moving from phase two to phase three approval for the FDA [US drugs regulator] and they didn't get the approval.

Unfortunately, I didn't even understand – this is how arrogant and stupid I was – how the leverage worked in my personal account

'I had all these call options that were levered in my account. Unfortunately, I didn't even understand – this is how arrogant and stupid I was – how the leverage worked in my personal account.

'And so, the margin desk called me at Goldman Sachs and told me: 'You're in the hole by $50,000.' And let me tell you something, at that time in my life, we're at $150,000 of school debt. I really couldn't afford it.

'I went to go see my boss… and I explained to him what I did. And he looked at me and said, 'Man, you are as stupid as stupid could be. And hopefully you learned your lesson that the markets know more than you do.'

Whether Scaramucci has learned the importance of specialist knowledge remains to be seen.

Earlier this year, at the peak of the crypto rally, Scaramucci's firm SkyBridge, a fund of hedge funds, announced it had started a bitcoin fund.

'Bitcoin is better at being gold than gold is at being gold,' he said at the time. 'It's easier to store, it's harder to steal, it's more portable, and so therefore, it's become the ledger or the storage of the future in terms of the storage of value.'

Since then the bitcoin price has tumbled from about $60,000 to as low as just under $30,000, although it has since bounced back to the $45,000 mark.

Scaramucci has developed an uncharacteristic self-awareness of both his investments and his time on Trump's presidential campaign and later in the White House.

'Donald Trump was not even choice number one or two. But when he called to recruit me, that's where the ego kicked in. And, you know, you do a lot of regrettable things based on your ego,' he told Gabby Logan on ii's podcast.

'Being fired from the White House was a huge disappointment. It turned out to be a blessing – I didn't know that at the time. But it was a huge disappointment.'

Donald Trump... when he called to recruit me, that's where the ego kicked in

The Mooch was forced out of the White House after calling a reporter to give a profanity-laced rant against his own colleagues.

His main lesson from this ill-fated experience has been one of both humility and toughness: 'I'm more humble. I think it's made me more psychologically minded. I think I have a lot more empathy for people that go through things.

He added: 'When I got blown out of the White House, a lot of people would have rolled on something like that, but I got up like a crash dummy and just dusted myself off and went back to work.

'It was a week after I got fired. I was walking with him [his son AJ] in Santa Monica, on the promenade, and he's like: 'Dad, jeez, are you OK?' And I'm like: 'Yeah, not only am I OK, watch what I do with this thing.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The City's top lobby group is working on a secret project to help London win more business and overtake New York as a financial centre.

TheCityUK, which lobbies on behalf of a swathe of City giants, is drawing up recommendations for Government to boost the 'competitiveness' of London as a place to do business after Brexit, according to sources close to the plans.

The new strategy, which could be published as early as next month, will make a series of proposals on crucial issues including trade policy, regulation and investment into the UK.

A source involved in the ambitious project said: 'It's ultimately about why firms should base themselves in London.'

Writing on the wall: A report by New Financial said the US 'is the world's top financial centre by a wide margin' based on financial data such as the number of companies being floated

It is understood that TheCityUK is consulting with a number of trade bodies including UK Finance, which represents the banking industry.

The move comes as New York powers ahead as the world's biggest financial hub. London lost the top spot in a ranking of global financial centres in 2018, with New York moving ahead, according to thinktank Z/Yen.

A report by New Financial said the US 'is the world's top financial centre by a wide margin' based on financial data such as the number of companies being floated.

Firms have raised $84billion (£60.5billion) in the US on the New York and Nasdaq exchanges this year to mid-July, compared with $12.7billion in the UK, according to consultancy EY.

The report concluded that the UK is 'by far the largest' financial centre in Europe, but warned that rivals in Asia are 'catching up fast'.

The report added: 'It is too early to capture the impact of Brexit on international financial activity but the UK's lead in key sectors such as foreign equity trading and foreign bank assets will already have been dented.'

A separate report has warned that London's position as a top City for financial services is being 'challenged' by Asia.

The UK struck a trade deal last year with the EU after Brexit, although this excluded the services sector, which represents about 80 per cent of the British economy.

Some British policymakers are concerned that the UK is losing certain types of business to New York and parts of the EU.

London last month reclaimed its title as Europe's top share trading hub after briefly losing its crown to Amsterdam following Brexit. The boost came after London opened its doors to trading in Swiss shares when it ditched an EU-wide ban on Swiss stock trading.

A boom in amateur share trading by people spending extra time at home because of Covid-19 has also buoyed British markets.

Policymakers are concerned that Britain could lose out to New York and China unless reforms to the City are quickly adopted.

The Government has commissioned sweeping reviews of the City to modernise the stock exchange and attract more fast-growing technology companies and entrepreneurs.

A review led by former Worldpay boss Ron Kalifa found that the US Nasdaq exchange attracts 40 per cent of companies going public, compared with just 5 per cent in the UK.

There is also mounting concern that Europe is planning to take some of the trading of complicated financial contracts away from London and shift it to Paris or Frankfurt.

A report in May said that £2.3trillion of monthly trading in these contracts has left the UK and gone to New York and cities in the EU.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Technology is constantly being used to spy on us. It monitors how we drive, tracks our energy usage and even counts how many times we visit the gym.

But this can be good news. The information collected by 'smart' devices has the potential to substantially reduce annual household bills.

So-called 'snooper-tech' not only ensures our homes are energy efficient, but can reward us for keeping fit, driving sensibly and controlling our spending.

Cash watch: Technology that spies on you can be used to save you money

According to Alex Gunz, manager of investment fund Future Trends Equity at asset manager Heptagon Capital, such gadgets are now commonplace in British homes.

'Most consumers now reluctantly accept that they'll have to give up a bit of personal information in exchange for potential cost savings,' he says.

It's a trend he expects to continue with companies using this data to learn more about their customers and improve their products.

He adds: 'An increasing number of items in the home, whether it's the fridge or the lights, will in time be controlled remotely by a master device such as a mobile phone.'

Here are some key areas where snooper-tech can save you cash.

1. Car insurance

Agreeing to have a 'black box' installed in your car that reports back on your driving behaviour can help cut your motor insurance premiums.

These devices are fitted under the bonnet – or even stuck to the inside of the windscreen – and record everything you do behind the wheel.

This can include how far you're travelling, what time of day or night you're on the road, whether you stick to the speed limit, and if you are an erratic driver.

Crispin Moger, chief executive of insurance company Marmalade, says the devices are helping people understand how they can improve their driving skills. He says: 'With our black box insurance, customers can earn a safe driving discount on renewal of their policy of up to 25 per cent – on top of any standard no claims discount.'

2. Energy bills

Smart thermostats can give you better control over your heating – and energy bills, according to Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown.

'Some thermostats use geolocation technology to spot if you've left home and remind you to turn the heating off,' she says. 'Others track your heating use and then heat your home accordingly.'

Smart meters show how you're burning through energy – and what needs to change to reduce your usage.

'The reality is these meters have had teething problems and earlier versions just weren't smart enough,' adds Coles. 'Yet newer versions promise to live up to their smart billing.'

Octopus Energy says: 'By combining a smart energy tariff, a smart meter and smart home products, homeowners can save substantial amounts of money on their energy bills by setting appliances – such as an electric car home charger – to run at greener and cheaper times.'

3. Life insurance

Your smartwatch or fitness tracker can now do a lot more than simply count your steps or show your latest text messages.

Some insurance companies are incentivising customers with attractive offers for wearing one, according to Jo Thornhill, money expert at comparison website MoneySupermarket.

'The information from trackers gives providers an indication of how well the customer takes care of themselves,' she explains.

For example, Vitality Insurance rewards active customers through lower increases in annual premiums on private healthcare policies or life cover.

It also introduced an Apple Watch benefit in 2016. Customers can buy the watch for a low upfront price with monthly repayments spread over three years.

But the repayments are reduced if the customer records significant activity on the watch, demonstrating a resolve to stay fit.

IT SAVES ME HUNDREDS A YEAR Neil Kinson, 52, embraced 'snooper-tech' after buying an electric car – and is now saving himself hundreds of pounds every year. The married father of two, who works in the software industry, began focusing on energy consumption after trading in his diesel Land Rover Discovery for a Jaguar I-Pace. His deal with Octopus Energy included getting an Ohme smart charger and access to a cheap overnight tariff. 'When I pull on to the drive, I plug the car in and the charger switches on during the cheapest energy period,' he says. 'I was spending £2,250 a year on diesel, but now the equivalent electricity costs are around £250.' The move inspired him to explore other smart tech at home in Wokingham, Berkshire, where he lives with Helen, 48, and children, Emma, 16, and 13-year-old James. He uses virtual assistant Alexa to switch the lights off in rooms that are not being used. He adds: 'The dishwasher has a timer so we set it after dinner to come on in the cheapest energy period. It's the same with the tumble dryer.'

4. In the kitchen

Some washing machines can be set to operate when energy tariffs are at their lowest, according to Craig Melson, head of digital devices, environment and sustainability, at trade association techUK.

He adds: 'Smart fridges can minimise food waste by alerting users to expiry dates and automatically order replenishments when items can be purchased at a competitive price.'

Sensors in these appliances can also detect and diagnose faults. Melson says: 'As well as the obvious safety benefits, householders will be able to tackle issues early before a fault results in an expensive repair or replacement.'

5. Leaking pipes

Technology can warn you of hidden dangers in the house. For example, a LeakBot sensor will constantly monitor for any pipe leaks – and then send an alert to the homeowner's smartphone if one is detected.

This device, which costs around £150, is clipped near your stopcock. Insurer Hiscox is among the first to offer a free LeakBot to those who take out its buildings insurance.

Finally, a smart power strip or smart plug can prevent household items left on standby – a television for example – quietly adding to energy bills.

Says Hargreaves' Coles: 'We know items left on standby and chargers that remain plugged in act like vampires, consuming energy while we sleep.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A judge on the Irish version of television show Dragon's Den has launched a CBD brand Pureis, which has managed to hook two household names as ambassadors.

Lady Chanelle McCoy stepped away from her family business – Galway-based Chanelle Pharma – and joined forces with business partner Caroline Glynn to launch the brand.

CBD has become a growing industry in the last decade. Essentially, it is the second most prevalent of the active ingredients of marijuana.

Irish Dragon Den star Chanelle McCoy claims she's launched the first clinically safe CBD food supplement and says she's proud to set a benchmark for compliance

Depending on who you ask, it has health benefits - but the jury is out, and while the industry is in its infancy, there are varying degrees of quality products to buy in Britain.

It can now be found in a range of items, from cans of drink to drops, gummies to oral sprays.

Caroline has serious credentials. She has worked with Chanelle in the pharmaceutical industry for 11 years and holds a degree in pharmacology and a masters in biomedical science.

Her aim is to make CBD products mainstream, while at the same time ensuring that her products meet regulatory standards.

As such, she claims that Pureis is the first CBD company in the world to receive a Validated Novel Food Application from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Food Standards Agency UK (FSA).

It took 18 months and £1.5million in investment to complete a full suite of clinical studies in the UK and Irish market to meet and satisfy the EFSA and FSA UK.

Chanelle says: 'From the beginning of this journey, it was vital to us that we brought products to market which were backed by clinical studies.

'This enabled us to give our customers the necessary reassurance that they are receiving, high quality, full certified CBD products.

'Novel Food Approval is a positive step in the right direction for breaking the stigma around CBD in the market.

'Only through industry taking the lead can this stigma be addressed. We are proud to be setting a benchmark for compliance.'

The Pureis products, which include capsules and oral sprays, are now stocked in over 1,000 retailers including many pharmacies, Boots and Holland & Barrett.

Chanelle says its best-seller is a 560ml spearmint oil product. 'You take under the tongue. We've had good feedback so far and it retails for £50.'

Lady Chanelle McCoy (left) joined forces with business partner Caroline Glynn (right) to launch Pureis CBD products.

For those who feel £50 is too steep for an initial outlay there are some entry level price points.

Chanelle says: 'There are currently 11 products in the range. For £10 you can try the capsules for seven days before you make a bigger financial commitment.'

Accessing safe CBD

The business partners say they started researching the market back in 2015 when they heard about people struggling to access CBD.

Some consumers even went so far as to purchase the products from abroad where countries had regulated its use.

This prompted the duo to set up Chanelle McCoy Health – an R&D-led pharmaceutical company to make it more accessible in the UK and Ireland.

CBD products must meet certain standards to be legally bought and sold in the UK.

However, she says there are still many CBD products on the high street that aren't properly authorised.

CBD products must also not contain more than 0.2 per cent THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) – a psychoactive compound in cannabis.

There's plans to expand the Pureis brand into the European and US market as well

Chanelle says that Pureis is one of the few products on the market that guarantees zero per cent THC, meaning it does not cause a 'high' and is not addictive.

We have gone one step further on phase two efficacy studies to prove it clinically works and not just from anecdotal evidence Lady Chanelle McCoy, co-founder, Pureis Lady Chanelle McCoy, co-founder, Pureis

The pair say the purpose of the Novel Food application, announced by The UK Food Standards Agency in February 2020, was to ensure safety by way of clinical studies and compliance within the CBD industry so that consumers could have access to safe CBD and purchase products with confidence

Chanelle points out that prior to the classification, the vagueness of the law gave way to an unregulated sector with issues of quality assurance, plant contamination and illegal levels of THC.

She adds: 'Due to its unique production method, the product has high levels of CBD with no intra batch variability, no toxins or pollutants, no terpenes, no heavy metals, no pesticides, and no insecticides.'

The Pureis products range in price but some supplements can be bought at an entry level of £10 to try out before making a major financial commitment

Challenges of promoting Pureis

Besides meeting regulatory standards, other challenges for the business has included the stigma surrounding CBD products and the advertising restrictions.

Chanelle says: 'There's a lot of people that haven't tried it. Around 55 per cent of the products have illegal levels of THC. The fundamental problem with the market is that people want to try the products but they get disillusioned over CBD.'

Chanelle says that they're currently running a trial on the products to establish their effectiveness with sleep

People are also concerned about the efficacy of CBD products.

Chanelle says she and her business partner studied CBD's effectiveness when it came to difficulties with sleep, arthritis, anxiety and menopause.

They are currently running a clinical trial on Pureis' effectiveness with sleep. She says: 'We have gone one step further on phase two efficacy studies to prove it clinically works and not just from anecdotal evidence.'

In spite of all the efforts to make the product clinically safe there are restrictions on advertising.

But Chanelle and the Pureis team have got around that by getting the product promoted by celebrity ambassadors which include former England rugby captain turned royalty, Mike Tindall and singer and television personality Martine McCutcheon.

Tindall, who is married to the queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall and had a son born in March this year endorsed the Pureis product a few months ago saying it helped him nod off.

According to reports he takes 560mg oil at night and 20mg capsules in the morning. He tweeted: 'So go be onboard, good sleep, positive times ahead!!!'

McCutcheon, meanwhile, has claimed it has helped with her CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) and fibromyalgia saying on Instagram: 'I wasn't sure about using CBD, then a few months ago I tried Pureis and it really helped me with my aches and pains and my general well-being.'

Chanelle says she and her husband, jockey AP McCoy, take the product too.

She says: 'I take the oil at night and on my way to London now I've taken the low dose spray. It does not take the edge off. You know you're never going to be sleepy so it's great for general coping.'

The next step

While Chanelle, like the other Dragons on the popular show, is renowned for grilling candidates on their business acumen and figures, she's keeping Pureis' performance under wraps for now.

What she is willing to reveal, however, is that the business is now profitable after 18 months and that it's grown its turnover by 100 per cent month on month.

Lady Chanelle McCoy says she and husband, jockey AP McCoy, take the product too

She adds: 'We've put a lot of money in, which we have paid for.

'We have no debt and are looking to bring in more investment into the business towards the end of the year. We are talking to pharmaceutical companies that have expressed an interest and to individuals.'

The bigger plan for Chanelle and her business partner is for Pureis to venture into the medicine and cosmetics space.

Chanell says: 'We have a very exciting RND pipeline and different products like CBD tampons, but we want to put the clinical data behind it. We want the trust.'

Geographical expansion is on the cards too with ambitions to enter the European and American market.

Chanelle says: 'We are in poll position to be the first to get a European license to launch CBD food supplements. We expect to get the license in the second quarter of next year.'

With regards to the US there is still a few hurdles to overcome. For instance, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) haven't yet regulated CBD food supplements.

Chanelle explains: 'If you pick up a [CBD product] box it will say "CBD supplement" and not "food" and it won't give you instructions to take it orally as it's illegal to do that. This is even though they have legalised marijuana.'

But she says they're in positive discussions with the FDA.

While the market for CBD products is a saturated one, Chanelle believes there is still lots of potential.

But she feels the only way to be truly successful in this industry is to comply with regulatory guidelines.

She says: 'There's 750 brands in the UK and four of us are on the Government approved list. So that just tells you how uncompliant other brands are. Get on the list and then you have huge potential.'

Her advice to budding entrepreneurs? 'Do what you love, watch your cash and have a good strategic plan. Stick to it, but make sure you can adapt as well.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@BHP, the world's biggest miner, has confirmed it is in talks to sell its oil business in a move that would mark its exit from the fossil fuels industry.

London and Sidney-listed BHP Group said it is in discussions to merge its oil and gas assets with those of Australia's Woodside Petroleum, potentially in exchange for shares.

The move would mark the latest step in the mining giant’s shift away from fossil fuels, having already sold some coal assets, to focus solely on its other mining operations.

BHP is a producer of iron ore, copper, petroleum, coal, nickel and potash

It comes as BHP and other large mining companies have been facing calls from shareholders and environmental pressure groups to reduce their exposure to fossil fuels.

BHP recently sold its stake in a joint venture which operated two coking coal mines, while it also offloaded its shale oil and gas fields in the US to BP for $10.5billion in 2018.

Chief executive Mike Henry has previously said the group will expand further into commodities which can be used for low-carbon power generation and look further towards higher quality raw materials.

'While discussions between the parties are currently progressing, no agreement has been reached on any such transaction,' BHP said today, adding that it was evaluating a number of options.

The group is a producer of iron ore, copper, petroleum, coal (both metallurgical and energy), nickel and potash. But analysts said iron ore and copper are 'the materials that really count'.

'Shareholder pressure is clearly building to sell or demerge the assets, but Mr Henry and the board have a tricky balancing act if they are to strike the right balance between shareholder satisfaction and shareholder value,' said AJ Bell investment director, Russ Mould.

'Management may simply feel that the pressure to act is too great and the alternatives – loss of value, loss of reputation and, in extremis, even loss of license to operate – are much bigger risks than missing out on any oil price recovery, especially as the oil and gas’ assets contribution to overall profitability is relative modest in the grand scheme of things (at least for the moment),' he added.

The potential sale comes as in the first half, BHP wrote down the value of its oil and gas assets by $1.6billion.

Tomorrow's results will reveal if there have been any further reassessments.

Analysts at Bernstein have estimated that the BHP division could be valued at around $13billion, or £9.4billion.

BHP shares were down 1.8 per cent to £22.80 just after London market close.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Having 'a good listener' reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease and slows down the rate at which the brain ages, a study suggests.

Adults who said they had someone they could talk to scored better in cognition assessments than those who did not have a confidant.

Participants with a friend or family member they could count on also had brains that were four years younger than their counterparts.

It's thought that deep and meaningful conversations keep the brain active, preventing the build-up of harmful deposits that cause Alzheimer's.

Age is the number one risk factor for the disease but loneliness and a lack of mental stimulation in old age speeds up the condition.

New York University scientists looked at the brain cognitive function of more than 2,100 volunteers with an average age of 63.

They said that, although Alzheimer's typically occurs in the elderly, the results apply to middle-aged and younger adults.

Having a 'good listener' among your friends and family can help prevent Alzheimer's and slow down the rate at which the brain ages by up to four years, according to researchers

The researchers used MRI scans to measure brain volume - with lower numbers pointing to worse cognitive function and greater risk of Alzheimer's.

The results were published in the online journal JAMA Network Open.

People who scored best also said they had 'someone available most of all of the time whom you can count on to listen to you when you need to talk.'

Lead researcher Dr Joel Salinas, a neurologist at NYU, said people should view the results as an opportunity to reach out and keep in touch with loved ones.

WHAT IS DEMENTIA? THE KILLER DISEASE THAT ROBS SUFFERERS OF THEIR MEMORIES A GLOBAL CONCERN Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a range of progressive neurological disorders (those affecting the brain) which impact memory, thinking and behaviour. There are many different types of dementia, of which Alzheimer's disease is the most common. Some people may have a combination of types of dementia. Regardless of which type is diagnosed, each person will experience their dementia in their own unique way. Dementia is a global concern but it is most often seen in wealthier countries, where people are likely to live into very old age. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED? The Alzheimer's Society reports there are more than 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK today, of which more than 500,000 have Alzheimer's. It is estimated that the number of people living with dementia in the UK by 2025 will rise to over 1 million. In the US, it's estimated there are 5.5 million Alzheimer's sufferers. A similar percentage rise is expected in the coming years. As a person's age increases, so does the risk of them developing dementia. Rates of diagnosis are improving but many people with dementia are thought to still be undiagnosed. IS THERE A CURE? Currently there is no cure for dementia. But new drugs can slow down its progression and the earlier it is spotted the more effective treatments are. Source: Alzheimer's Society Advertisement

'This study adds to growing evidence that people can take steps, either for themselves or the people they care about most, to increase the odds they'll slow down cognitive aging or prevent the development of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease — something that is all the more important given that we still don't have a cure for the disease.

'While there is still a lot that we don't understand about the specific biological pathways between psychosocial factors like listener availability and brain health, this study gives clues about concrete, biological reasons why we should all seek good listeners and become better listeners ourselves.'

Amyloid plaques start to form as the walls of the blood vessels in the brain start to stiffen and lose their ability to get rid of toxins.

Some patients have weaker blood vessel walls - possibly due to their genes - and gradually, the toxins build up.

They create deposits called plaques which damage the surrounding cells and cause Alzheimer's Disease, the most common form of dementia.

An estimated 850,000 people in Britain have dementia and one in three of us will develop the illness during our lifetime.

But drug companies have failed to find a cure despite millions being invested in research over the past few decades.

Without a 'good listener', brain function can start to decline in adults during their 40s and 50s to the point where their brains are four years 'older' than those with a good listener to hand, the study found.

Dr Salinas added: 'These four years can be incredibly precious. Too often we think about how to protect our brain health when we're much older, after we've already lost a lot of time decades before to build and sustain brain-healthy habits.

'But today, right now, you can ask yourself if you truly have someone available to listen to you in a supportive way, and ask your loved ones the same.

'Taking that simple action sets the process in motion for you to ultimately have better odds of long-term brain health and the best quality of life you can have.'

The research recommends that doctors should look at the social history of patients to see if they people around them they can talk to.

As well as ageing the brain, the lack of such support can also lead to isolation and depression.

Salinas said: 'Loneliness is one of the many symptoms of depression, and has other health implications for patients.

'These kinds of questions about a person's social relationships and feelings of loneliness can tell you a lot about a patient's broader social circumstances, their future health, and how they're really doing outside of the clinic.'

To look at brain function, the volunteers - part of a long term health study in the US - were assessed on the kind of contact they had with others and whether it included such factors as listening but also good advice, love and affection and emotional support.

The study added: 'While there is still a lot that we don't understand about the specific biological pathways between psychosocial factors like listener availability and brain health, this study gives clues about concrete, biological reasons why we should all seek good listeners and become better listeners ourselves.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Things turned nasty on The Voice Australia on Monday night.

A furious Rita Ora confronted Keith Urban after she was blocked from recruiting contestant Chantel Cofie onto her team.

Each coach has two 'blocks' they can secretly use during the auditions this year, which means they're able to block another coach from getting a singer they want.

'You're dead to me': Furious Rita Ora, 30, (pictured) blasted Keith Urban, 53, on The Voice for 'blocking' her during Monday night's episode

Chantel, 23, had all four coaches impressed as she sang her original song 2020, inspired by the death of George Floyd and the injustices black people face daily.

However, as the coaches started pitching for the artist to join their teams, the Let Me Love You singer was blocked from potentially getting her on Team Rita.

'I'm p***ed,' Rita shouted. 'In the words of Boy George last season, you're dead to me,' she said, trying to figure out who blocked her.

'Whoa, they're strong words,' fellow coach Guy Sebastian replied, before asking: 'Who did the block?'

'It was you wasn't it?' Rita asked Keith, who began grinning.

'You blocked me didn't you?' she once again asked as he smile grew.

'I knew it! You blocked me!'

Not impressed! 'I'm p***ed,' Rita shouted. 'In the words of Boy George last season, you're dead to me.'

Not happy: 'It was you wasn't it?' Rita asked Keith, who began grinning

'Listen I am angry, but that doesn't dispute that that was one of the best auditions I've ever seen,' Rita then told the singer.

'You need someone that will kill for you, and I did,' added Rita.

Keith then attempt to woo Chantel over over his team, before she decided to go with Guy Sebastian.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The world's most powerful activist investor has secretly built a stake in energy giant SSE in a move that could lead to a £20billion takeover bid for the FTSE100-listed company.

City sources said Elliott Management, which has been dubbed a 'corporate raider' for buying shares and forcing change at large companies, has recently bought a large shareholding in SSE which supplies around five million Britons with energy to their homes.

It's not clear how large Elliott's shareholding in SSE is and why it has taken the position in the London-listed group.

However, some City sources said that if the company's management team fails to engage with the activist hedge fund it may launch a confrontational campaign to force a shake up at the blue-chip power and broadband provider.

Under the microscope: It's not clear how large Elliott's shareholding in SSE is

Elliott Management, founded by Wall Street hedge fund manager Paul Singer, specialises in buying shareholdings in big listed corporations and then agitating for change to boost the company's share price.

If Elliott, which is also known as Elliott Advisers, does reveal its position in SSE this would be the second time in 2021 it has targeted a FTSE100 giant.

Earlier this year it emerged Elliott had become a shareholder in GlaxoSmithKline and has made a series of controversial demands to the pharmaceutical giant's board.

Those demands include appointing new directors and attempting to force through a process that would determine whether Dame Emma Walmsley should hold on to her job as chief executive of the company when it spins off its consumer division.

Effectively, Dame Emma would have to reapply for her own job.

Elliott also called for GlaxoSmithKline to run a sale process of its consumer health division – which includes brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol paracetamol – ahead of a demerger of the unit into a separately listed company next year.

Some City sources speculated Elliott's move on SSE may eventually lead to a multi-billion bid for all or some of the energy group.

Many of Elliott's previous activist investments and campaigns have led to significant corporate activity. For example, three years ago Elliott bought a huge shareholding in Whitbread, the operator of Premier Inn, and pushed for the company to sell its Costa Coffee chain.

Four months later Coca-Cola agreed to buy Costa Coffee from Whitbread for £3.9billion.

And last year AstraZeneca paid $39billion for American drugs group Alexion Pharmaceuticals after Elliott repeatedly pushed for the US-listed company to sell itself to a potential buyer.

If Elliott's move on SSE does trigger corporate activity City sources speculated the FTSE100- listed firm could be of interest to a European power giant, such as France's EDF or Spain's Iberdrola, which paid £11.6 billion for Scottish Power in 2007.

Elliott was founded by Paul Singer, a Republican donor, in 1977 with $1.3million from friends and family. His personal wealth is estimated to be around $4.3billion.

Since then, Singer has grown the business into the world's largest hedge fund group with over $30billion under management.

As well as investing in blue chip businesses and taking on established management teams Elliott runs a wide range of equity and debt investment strategies that have led to an investment in AC Milan, the Italian Serie A football club.

Elliot's other strategies include buying up sovereign bonds of struggling countries, such as Peru and Argentina, on the cheap and pursuing full payment through the courts. This has drawn criticism from commentators for its aggressive approach in pushing for change.

SSE and Elliott both declined to comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@HSBC is dangling a £140 cash carrot in a bid to lure in new current account customers.

The banking giant is offering the cash bribe to those who switch to its Advance account using the Current Account Switch Service and taking with them at least two direct debits or standing orders.

New customers can also apply through MoneySuperMarket without the need to use CASS, although anyone tempted will need to act fast, as the offer ends on Thursday 19 August.

Cash carrot: HSBC's cash offer ends on 19 August 2021 and could be tempted for Tesco current account customers, who will see accounts shut soon

HSBC lost 26,743 current account switchers compared to the 23,892 it gained during the first three months of 2021, according to official figures.

One obstacle switchers need to overcome is that they will need to pay in at least £1,750 each month or £10,500 every six months to be eligible.

Michelle Stevens, deputy editor at personal finance comparison site Finder, said: 'HSBC's switching bonus is certainly generous by current standards, but you should read the fine print carefully before deciding whether it is the right deal for you.

'In order to get the bonus, you need to pay £1,750 into the account each month, which is a significant amount of money.

'If you don't think you would be able to do this then it would probably be better to wait for a more accessible deal to come along.'

Those who switch to HSBC will also be able to open a regular savings account in which they can stash away £25-£250 each month and earn 1 per cent interest.

Although 1 per cent interest is not bad given that the average easy-access savings rate is 0.18 per cent, according to Moneyfacts, it is still possible to to better.

Stevens added: 'Even if you paid in the maximum amount allowed of £250 per month (£3,000 per year), you would only earn interest of around £16.'

Should you apply?

More than 7.3 million people have now switched their bank account since 2013, according to figures from the CASS.

There are often benefits and incentives to be reaped from switching as banks compete for current account customers and £140 is certainly eye-catching.

With 213,000 Tesco bank customers needing to find a new bank by 30 November this might be particularly tempting to them.

Over the course of the past year, from June 2020 to June 2021, a total of 646,569 switches were processed by the Current Account Switch Service

But whilst cash incentives can be a big draw, it is important to consider the other factors that make switching worthwhile.

Customer service, overdraft limits, interest rates, cashback, saving perks and other niche benefits such as cinema tickets are all factors that count for something.

Starling Bank, for example, which made a net gain of 17,769 switchers between January and March, according to the CASS figures, doesn't offer incentives to switchers, instead relying on the strength of its customer service and its app.

Virgin Money, which secured a net gain of 17,495 switchers during that period is currently offering joiners a £150 Virgin Experience Days gift card allowing its customers to choose between thousands of experiences from spa days and short breaks to sky diving.

Customers worried about dipping into their overdraft each month might be more tempted by switching to First Direct and benefiting from having the first £250 of any overdraft borrowing being interest free.

Andrew Hagger, founder and director pf personal finance website, MoneyComms said: 'Don't simply switch for the cash bribe - ask yourself if the account really suits the way you run your day to day banking - if you often go into overdraft for example, then there are cheaper deals to consider.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Scottish Mortgage has delivered big returns to investors by backing some of technology and the modern consumer world's biggest names.

But are the best days already past of the star firms, such as Amazon, Google and Tesla, that have helped deliver a 474 per cent return over ten years?

And is China's burgeoning technology scene good enough to warrant major backing?

On this episode of the Investing Show, Scottish Mortgage's co-manager Tom Slater, joins us to explain how the trust invests and why he believes 'the world's most exciting, interesting growth companies' have many more years of good times ahead.

And Slater says that investing for growth around the world is not just a case of backing US tech stars, with China also increasingly offering outstanding opportunities.

He says: 'Today some of the ideas, the technology and the strength of the businesses that are coming out of Beijing and the east coast of China are on a par if not better than their Silicon Valley counterparts.'

Slater explains that Scottish Mortgage's philosophy is to achieve 'long-term capital appreciation for shareholders' and to do that by investing in outstanding firms.

But the fund manager adds that there is another very important part to seeking out companies that fit the bill and also to the trust's own approach to investment.

He says that companies must have 'the most attractive long-term prospects' while Scottish Mortgage aims to be a 'very long term and patient shareholder'. This can mean volatility over the short term but the managers believe that is necessary for those long-term returns.

Slater adds: 'We don't think that we can predict the future, we don't have answer to what the world will look like, but can we find companies and entrepreneurs we think are shaping that future.'

Scottish Mortgage invests in some of the world's largest and most easily recognisable tech companies, counting Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix among its holdings, along with China's tech giants Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu.

One of the questions investors raise about these established tech stars is whether investors have already had the best returns they will offer.

Certainly Scottish Mortgage's recent record of outstanding growth has slowed, with an 8.6 per cent return in 2019 so far, compared to a 16 per cent global investment trust average.

But Slater points out that in business terms the current crop of tech giants are still relatively young companies.

Amazon's reputation for innovation has delivered new products such as Alexa

He says that Scottish Mortgage believes the best will have opportunities for a long time to come, adding, 'we don't think there's any reason why if a business model is underpinned by technology it should mean its longevity is any less than more traditional companies.'

As an example of this he cites the continuing opportunities for even a company as big as Amazon, ranging from online groceries and same and next day delivery in the US, to improving its digital shopfront and areas such as digital search and its web services division.

The key to this argues the fund manager is Amazon's commitment to experimentation and innovation at scale.

Among the other famous names in Scottish Mortgage's top ten holdings are two very different car companies: Tesla and Ferrari.

The attraction of electric and self-driving car pioneer Tesla to a trust like Scottish Mortgage is obvious, but why also hold an old-school sports and racing car company like Ferrari?

A name like Tesla is expected in the Scottish Mortgage portfolio but why does the trust hold Ferrari, a name more synonymous with the old school motoring world?

Slater says that firstly Ferrari makes some of the best cars in the world and secondly it is one of the most desirable brands. The Italian car maker, which listed on the stock market in 2015, intends to profit on both its cars and the iconic brand but knows it must tread carefully in doing so.

The fund manager says that Scottish Mortgage believes those in charge at Ferrari can successfully walk that tightrope and deliver growth for years to come.

A sizeable chunk of Scottish Mortgage's £7.5billion worth of investments is now in companies that are not listed on the stock market. This could worry some investors, as investing in unquoted companies at scale has sparked some controversy over the past year, with the high profile downfall of star fund manager Neil Woodford.

However, as an investment trust Scottish Mortgage cannot be forced to sell to meet withdrawals in the same way that an open-ended investment fund manager can. Meanwhile, Slater explains that the trust's private company holdings tend to be in very sizeable firms.

Investing in unquoted companies is important for Scottish Mortgage, argues Slater, as companies are choosing to stay private longer and firms are choosing to list much later in their life cycle.

He says it is not about buying very small companies or becoming venture capitalists but about investing in substantial companies that in other eras would be publicly listed, such as Tik Tok owner Bytedance.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investors are used to funds investing in specific countries and sectors, from mining, to property and technology, but mention one that invests in food and many will register some surprise.

Food is a little explored investment area. Yet, we all eat every day, and great businesses have emerged from growing, producing and selling it.

‘No one really knows much about the world of food, but it’s a vast area of change and if you are investing for opportunities then you want change’, says Henry Boucher, of the Sarasin Food and Agriculture Opportunities Fund.

On this episode of the Investing Show, Henry joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter to explain how from field to fork, and the consumer economy to climate change, there are fascinating changes taking place in the food chain and opportunities to invest.

How we produce food and what we eat is also increasingly coming under the spotlight, from the rise in veganism, to the desire to reduce food miles, encourage regenerative farming and cut fertiliser use.

Henry is keen to stress that the fund is not about investing solely in agriculture, but about backing companies that are involved in the entire food chain, from the materials and tools we use to grow food, to producing it, packaging it and ultimately selling it to the consumer.

He discusses why he holds companies that range from John Deere to Ocado – but avoids story stocks of the moment as Beyond Meat - and how investors can help with problems such as food security and trying to make agriculture more sustainable and reduce carbon emissions.

Henry has managed the Sarasin fund since its launch 11 years ago and he says that it looks at the ‘long-term slightly hidden trends’ in the world of food and how they can create a tailwind for companies over a long period time.

He says: ‘Those tailwinds include population growth, it includes things like urbanisation - as people move to the cities their diets change because they’ve got more access to supermarkets and things like that, and it includes just the rising standards of living across the world and the changes in our habits and in our health trends and concerns.’

He also explains why one of the key issues with food security and the need to feed more people is food waste, whether in production or consumption, and that technology can be a key to solving that.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The owner of the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn hotel chains swung back to profit in the first half of the year as loosening travel restrictions provided a much-need boost for the accommodation industry.

Intercontinental Hotels Group recorded an operating profit of $138million following a strong recovery in demand over the spring and summer months compared to the same time last year.

Its Holiday Inn Express brand saw the greatest increase in gross revenues, growing by around $700million to $2.7billion thanks to high demand in Greater China and the Americas.

Recovery: IHG's Holiday Inn Express brand saw the greatest increase in gross revenues, thanks to high demand in Greater China and the Americas

On a revenue per available room (RevPAR) basis - a standard measure used by the hospitality sector - the group's sales almost doubled in China and rose by more than a quarter in the Americas.

However, bookings in all regions remain significantly lower than their pre-pandemic levels due to tough international travel rules, with trade in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia continuing to be severely depressed.

Even as demand started to improve in May and June, IHG's total occupancy rates were 21 per cent down on the comparable period two years ago, while RevPAR was more than 40 per cent lower.

The firm has had to rely heavily on domestic excursions for their business, but even in high-performing markets like China and the Americas, tourists have not visited major cities in larger numbers.

This could be because they have wanted to avoid more crowded places where the risk of becoming infected by Covid-19 is higher.

Tourism-dependent companies in big cities like London, such as museums, theatres, and conference centres have also been forced to temporarily close their premises for much of the last year.

Quieter year: IHG's bookings in all regions remain significantly lower than their pre-pandemic levels due to tough international travel rules hitting demand, especially in big cities

They also rely heavily on foreign travellers, which combined with the imposition of travel restrictions, has caused a massive knock-on effect for the hotel sector.

Nonetheless, IHG's chief executive Keith Barr expressed optimism about the firm's results, commenting that the 'actions we have taken during the last 18 months position us well to exceed our pre-pandemic level of growth and profitability.'

He noted that nearly half of the company's hotels had seen RevPAR in July recover to their equivalent amount in 2019, and that there had been a resurgence in group activity and corporate bookings.

'While there is a risk of trading volatility in the balance of the year, and discretionary business trips, group bookings and international travel will take time to fully recover, we are confident in the strength of IHG's future prospects,' he added.

Resurgence: IHG chief executive Keith Barr said that nearly half of the company's hotels had seen RevPAR in July recover to their equivalent amount in 2019

IHG opened 132 hotels with 17,400 rooms and signed more than 200 during the reporting period and is planning to launch a new luxury brand in the coming weeks to complement its Six Senses, Regent and Kimpton brands.

Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at online trading platform AJ Bell, said this move by IHG 'suggests it reckons regular foreign travel might be dominated by wealthier holidaymakers in the future amid the extra costs and complexity of jetting overseas.

'InterContinental's model should, in theory, leave it well-positioned to rebound as the economy recovers, given it does not have lots of capital tied up in owning hotels.'

She warned, though, that this model 'does arguably give it less control over the pace of growth, with its hotel estate expanding much more slowly than that of rivals like Marriott and Hilton in the first half of the year.'

Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, further observed that IHG's Chinese market is looking more vulnerable following the reintroduction of Covid restrictions there in June to try and stem cases linked to the Delta variant.

'There’s no telling,' she adds, 'whether this will continue as variant concerns set in, but we’re mindful that China seems to be a few steps ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to the pandemic.

'If lockdowns ramp up through the rest of the summer, it could be a bleak forecast for other regions, which would chip away at IHG’s already precarious recovery.'

Shares in IHG closed trading 0.6 per cent lower at £47.05 on Tuesday.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Watches of Switzerland has recorded a robust three months of sales thanks to substantial demand from domestic customers in Britain and the US.

The luxury retailer saw sales of both watches and jewellery nearly double in the 13 weeks to the start of August compared to the same time in 2020 when it was severely hit by store closures.

Shares in the firm rose by 3.3 per cent to £10.58 on Tuesday as it revealed online sales also continued to grow despite British outlets being open throughout the three-month period, though at a more moderate rate of 15.9 per cent.

Good times: The luxury retailer saw sales of watches climb by 97.1% to more than £250m whilst luxury jewellery purchases grew by 98.9% to £20.1m

Its total first-quarter revenues jumped 101.9 per cent to £297.5million at constant currency levels, but they were also 45.8 per cent higher on a two-year basis.

Sales of luxury watches continued to represent the overwhelming bulk of purchases by consumers, climbing by 97.1 per cent to more than £250million whilst luxury jewellery sales shot up 98.9 per cent to £20.1million.

The FTSE 250 group said the impressive performance strengthened its existing full-year guidance, which revenues expected to be between £1.05billion and £1.1billion, a rise of 16 per cent to 21 per cent on the previous year.

The company's chief executive Brian Duffy told the Press Association that customers have opted to treat themselves, helping sales at the business to soar.

He said: 'In the UK and US there is accumulated disposable income and we are an attractive category in that sense. We call our categories "rational indulgences".

'Buying a beautiful luxury watch, you can feel confident that it's going to preserve value, it's going to last forever, it's a family heirloom.

'So, therefore, in these circumstances, when people have money to spend, our category is high up in their priority list. So, definitely, we've benefited from that.'

Watches of Switzerland CEO Brian Duffy said: 'Buying a beautiful luxury watch, you can feel confident that it's going to preserve value, it's going to last forever, it's a family heirloom'

'There is a willingness for people to trade up and indulge a bit more, maybe buying gold when they were thinking of buying a mix of gold and steel,' he said.

Revenues grew at a fast pace in the group's biggest market, the UK, where it has recently opened two boutique establishments selling just OMEGA and Breitling wares in Edinburgh, as well as a TAG Heuer store in Manchester.

But compared to two years ago, sales have expanded more rapidly in the US, where it said footfall in its Las Vegas and New York has quickly recovered, and its eight new mono-brand boutiques are 'performing strongly.'

It is planning to open more Watches of Switzerland outlets in Cincinnati, Ohio, the New Jersey-based shopping and entertainment centre, American Dream, and in the London district of Battersea.

Mr Duffy still pointed out that the pandemic did affect the company - hitting it for £100million - but said it had suffered less of an impact than other high street businesses even as tourism levels continued to remain severely weak.

He remarked. 'A big part of our business is where we can't get enough product to meet demand - Rolex in particular.

'So, the fact that we weren't selling products in the airports and to tourists meant more clients domestically and we were able to take advantage of that.

Forced to keep its stores shut for lockdown for most of the period, the group's UK retail arm sank to a £39million loss in the first half.

However, in June - when shops were able to re-open - Flutter's revenue equated to around 80 per cent of levels seen in the same month of 2019 with the firm labeling it 'encouraging.'

With a strong performance in the US, the Dublin-based group also saw its global total revenues surge over the period.

Impact: Paddy Power and Betfair owner Flutter Entertainment saw revenue from its UK-based stores drop by 47% in the first six months of this year

Across all global operations, Flutter said it raked in raked in more than £3billion in revenue in the first half of 2021, marking a 99 per cent increase from the same point a year ago.

The revenue growth was largely driven by a 40 per cent rise in average monthly players.

The company's overall pre-tax profits surged from £24million to £77million, representing a 221 per cent increase.

Shares in FTSE 100-listed Flutter have risen sharply this morning and were up 7.5 per cent - or 965p - to 13,905.00p at 9.45am. A year ago the group's share price was 11,650.00p.

Flutter's merger with The Stars Group in May last year has been a being a key factor in driving growth and enabling the company to rapidly expand in the US.

The group said its FanDuel product captured 45 per cent of the online sportsbook market share.

The group recorded a loss of 50.4p per share in a statement this morning, down from 18.1p per share at the beginning of last year.

While the betting group's net debt fell by 7 per cent in the six months to the end of June, it remains at nearly £2.7billion.

Group boss Peter Jackson said the firm's financials 'exceeded' expectations.

He added: 'In the US, we remain the number one online sports betting operator by some distance thanks to the quality of our products and the extensive reach of the FanDuel brand.

'The customer economics we are seeing in the US bode very well for the future.

'In the UK and Ireland, integration is progressing well with our three brands benefiting from shared learnings across product and operations.'

Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group, said: 'Flutter Entertainment PLC's interim results today paint an extremely positive picture for the company.

'The business grew substantially during this period, with 30 per cent revenue growth primarily driven by a 40 per cent increase in average monthly players.'

'The only negative factor remains the sizeable level of net debt which is around £2.682billion and continues to weigh on the businesses’ ability to pay dividends.'

He added: 'The company has also continued its commitment to safer gambling during this period as it boosted investment in resources and technology to optimise its controls.

'The company has already reported a solid start to the second half of the year. With further expansion across critical markets expected, the next six months look positive for the business and its stakeholders.'

The world’s leading crypto exchange platform listed on the US stock market this week and at one point hit a hefty $100billion valuation, before slipping back to $60billion.

That’s still a very big number, especially for a business that made $322million last year.

But Coinbase is profitable, its earnings are growing rapidly, it can cash in whether bitcoin and crypto prices rise or fall, and the cryptocurrency genie is well and truly out of the bottle.

So, could it prove to be a Facebook or Google of the crypto world?

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Tanya Jefferies and Simon Lambert look at the Coinbase float and what it means for the crypto and investing world.

They also discuss the Spac frenzy, how it’s leading to lucky dip investing for some but also more companies coming to market, and whether once you know what’s in a Spac it could ever be worth investing.

The army of traders playing with fire in the GameStop stock market frenzy this week have had their warning from a plenty of those who supposedly know best.

But it’s fun, they feel a common sense of purpose, they’re giving the big boys a bloody nose, and for now they’re winning. And so the game continues?

But should it have been allowed to get this far? Should the trading platforms have tried to nip this in the bud, should watchdogs have stepped in to protect small traders involved and other investors, or in a free market should we just let people get on with stuff – even if it’s punting call options on ramped up shares?

On this week’s podcast, Georgie Frost, Helen Crane and Simon Lambert discuss the Reddit-led rebellion, where small traders got together on the Wallstreetbets thread to take GameStop from a beaten-down and heavily-shorted stock to a cause celebre.

The bedroom traders piling in realised that by combining forces they could make the share price rise and beat the hedge funds at their own game, putting them in a short squeeze.

But is this really a rallying point for a financially disenfranchised generation still angry at the financial crisis and its after effects, or a get-rich-quick bandwagon that’s being jumped?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The global shortage of chips used in vehicles means manufacturers are unable to produce enough cars to meet demand - and drip-feed of deliveries means registrations are falling way behind the 10-year average

New car registrations in Britain fell a third annually in July and is down more than a fifth on the decade average for the month as the ongoing global semiconductor chip shortage continues to strangle the motor industry.

Official figures released today show that 123,296 new passenger vehicles were bought in the UK last month, which is 29.5 per cent fewer than a year ago and the lowest volume of registrations in July for 23 years.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the size of the decline has been artificially inflated due to a huge surge in vehicle sales in July 2020 - the first month motor dealers were allowed to reopen their doors to the public following the initial national Covid-19 lockdown.

However, sales were still 22.3 per cent down on the 10-year average for the seventh month of the year, despite there being plenty of demand for brand new cars.

Industry bosses have blamed the decline in registrations on both the global chip shortage and lower factory outputs as a result of the 'pingdemic'.

But while the logjam of deliveries caused by the worldwide lack of semiconductors is without questions causing huge delays for customers waiting on the arrival of new motors, the argument for a shortage of staff is only true of British built vehicles.

The stats show that the decline in registrations was predominantly driven by shrinking deliveries to large fleets which, at 61,140 units, was more than a quarter (28.7 per cent) down on the average recorded over the past decade.

Private registrations declined by a lesser extent, falling by 10.7 per cent to 59,841 new cars, though with the shortage of chips predicted to run into 2022, these figures could fall off even further for the remaining five months of the year.

As a result, the latest SMMT outlook has been revised downward and now forecasts registrations to reach around 1.82 million units in 2021.

This is still some 11.7 per cent up on 2020, but down from the 1.86 million forecast in April, and a massive 21.8 per cent off the average new car market figures dating back to 2010.

Official figures released this morning show that 123,296 new passenger vehicles were bought in the UK last month, which is 29.5% fewer than a year ago and the lowest volume of registrations in July for 23 years

The stats show that the decline in registrations was predominantly driven by shrinking deliveries to large fleets

Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: 'The automotive sector continues to battle against shortages of semiconductors and staff, which is throttling our ability to translate a strengthening economic outlook into a full recovery.

'The next few weeks will see changes to self-isolation policies which will hopefully help those companies across the industry dealing with staff absences, but the semiconductor shortage is likely to remain an issue until at least the rest of the year.

'As a result, we have downgraded the market outlook slightly for 2021.'

Richard Peberdy, UK head of automotive at KPMG, said the volumes in car registrations published today are not 'reflective of the real demand picture'.

He explained: 'When you dive deeper into the data it is clear that supply chain challenges have supressed production and extended carmakers' delivery times. Quite simply, fewer cars are getting onto forecourts.'

Richard Peberdy, UK head of automotive at KPMG, said the volumes in car registrations published today are not 'reflective of the real demand picture'

Ian Plummer, commercial director at Auto Trader echoed Mr Peberdy's comment.

'It would be easy to misinterpret these results as a drop in consumer demand for new cars, but our data shows that that couldn't be further from the truth.

'In fact, 1.4 million people viewed a new car on Auto Trader in July, which is up six per cent compared to last year's post lockdown July sales burst and more than double 2019 levels.

'With such strong demand, we're clearly in the grips of a 'seller's market' at the moment, although the potential lost sales make the supply constraints all the more frustrating for car brands and retailers alike while they're unable to reap all the benefits of this bounce back.'

As reported last month by This is Money, the knock-on effect of limited new car deliveries has forced many impatient drivers to scour the second-hand market for their replacement motors.

Plummer says Auto Trader found that three quarters of car buyers are prepared to buy a used car if their brand-new choice wasn't available - though this huge surge in demand has pushed used car prices up a record 14.1 per cent year-on-year. He said this is 'a trend which we may begin to see in the new car market too'.

The drip-feed of deliveries of new models is now starting to impact on sales volumes per model, with the Volkswagen Polo the most-bought new car in July, ahead of the Toyota Yaris and Kia Sportage.

The Vauxhall Corsa - the best-selling car so far this year - didn't make it into the top 10, while the most popular model for the last 12 years - Ford's Fiesta - languished down in ninth spot, showing just how volatile the standings have become under the constraints of supply issues.

The VW Polo supermini was the best-selling new car of July, with just over 3,000 registrations

The Vauxhall Corsa remains the nation's most-bought new car in 2021, though Ford's Fiesta has closed the gap in July with its rival not featuring in the top 10 most-registered models

SMMT also confirmed that the chip shortage is beginning to have a toll on the new van market, which posted its first decline since December 2020 as July registrations fell 15 per cent due to a lack of new model supply.

Jim Holder, editorial director of magazine and website What Car?, said: 'The appetite for car buying is clearly there, particularly as people reward themselves after lockdown.

'But the challenge is for manufacturers and retailers to manage customer expectations and to build pipelines in the meantime, while supply is limited.

'Ultimately, the supply issues will lift – but only those who have invested in servicing customer expectations will be in a position to reap the rewards as they do so.

Electric car sales remain on upward trajectory

The recent bumper growth in plug-in vehicles continued in July, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounting for 9 per cent of registrations, while plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) reached 8 per cent of market share.

With a combined 21,039 registrations of BEV and PHEV cars, it means there are more new vehicles being sold with plugs attached than diesels, with 15,592 sales of conventional and mild-hybrid oil burners in July.

SMMT now estimates that BEVs will account for 9.5 per cent of registrations by year end, while PHEVs are forecast to comprise 6.5 per cent of the market, collectively totalling around 290,000 units by the end of the year.

Mr Hawes described the rising sales of electrified vehicles as a 'bright spot' in the statistics and a reflection of consumers responding in ever greater numbers to 'new technologies, driven by increased product choice, fiscal and financial incentives and an enjoyable driving experience'.

SMMT estimates BEVs will account for 9.5% of registrations by year end and PHEVs will comprise 6.5% of the market, collectively totalling around 290,000 units by the close of 2021

KMPG says the increase in sales is a direct result of more companies offering salary sacrifice schemes to their staff for these vehicles, often making the choice as affordable as petrol or diesel, which is a major tipping point for the battery electric vehicle sector.

However, it warned that the rapid rate of development of EVs could mean today's plug-in cars suffer above average depreciation as motorists look to versions with longer ranges and shorter charge times.

'Interestingly, demand for electric vehicles may drive a bigger shift towards leasing and subscription models in the medium term versus outright ownership,' Peberdy explained.

'The technology is advancing quickly, with increasingly efficient and longer range vehicles set to roll off production lines soon.

'This risks a faster depreciation of today's models for consumers. Customers may want greater visibility and assurance over resale values and the total cost of ownership.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2018, my 80-year-old neighbour asked me to look at her utilities and telephone bills.

I discovered BT was charging her £30 per month for broadband. She has never owned a computer, tablet or iPhone. I contacted BT and eventually it stopped this charge.

Then, in March 2020, it started charging for broadband again. BT insists she ordered broadband that month. It says it's a fixed contract and she must continue paying until March 2022.

D. H., Letchworth, Herts.

One reader discovered their neighbour was being charged by BT for broadband even though she had never owned a computer, tablet or iPhone

Tony Hazell replies: BT assures me she has been using broadband, likely without realising it. I suspect others are in a similar situation.

She uses an old BT TV box to watch free channels, and views programmes that have already been shown via catch-up services.

She may not even know she is watching catch-up TV, as some TVs allow you to scroll backwards through the guide and click on the programme you want to watch.

Catch-up viewing can only be done via broadband. You were both surprised, as she tells you that when she clicks on certain channels she gets a message about upgrading her subscription. But this is another issue.

These channels will be part of BT's subscription packages. It is possible to hide them to avoid this irritation.

BT has agreed to put her on to a special deal. She will pay just £20.99 per month until March 2022, rather than £30.12.

Missing parcels with sentimental goods

My daughter split up with her long-term partner who, unknown to me, had been mentally abusive. She escaped to a friend's house with a few belongings.

When she returned with friends to get more items, her ex was obstructive, so she just grabbed what she could.

She later moved to a flat and arranged to have her favourite dresses, plus a quilt I'd made for her birthday four years previously, sent there via Parcelforce. But Parcelforce delivered the parcels to someone else.

It says that it checked the other address but did not get any reply. The firm won't release the name and address of the recipient due to confidentiality issues, so we can't investigate ourselves. We are heartbroken.

Name and address supplied.

Parcelforce lost one reader's treasured items and offered £500 compensation in return

Tony Hazell replies: Parcelforce says it has done all it can to locate the items but they have not been returned. The firm told you they had been 'disposed of', which sounds to me as if the recipient chose to sell them.

I asked Parcelforce why it had not involved the police when the recipient could or would not return the items. The firm refused to answer this and other questions.

You have been paid £500 compensation, but that is poor recompense for the loss of these items of sentimental value.

A spokesman said: 'We've apologised for any upset this has caused. We realise we cannot compensate for the sentimental value of these items, but we are giving a payment as a gesture of goodwill, as well as some flowers, in an effort to make amends.'

It feels as though Parcelforce decided it was simpler to write a cheque than to put extra effort into finding your lost treasures.

STRAIGHT TO THE POINT My Vodafone 'Pay as you go 1' tariff should provide unlimited minutes, texts and up to 50MB of data for 24 hours for £1 a day. But, after leaving my phone switched off for weeks, I was charged £12 for three days of light use. S. L., Atherstone, Warwicks. Tony Hazell replies: A Vodafone spokesman tried to reach you but hasn't heard back. Their best guess is that when you turned your phone back on, a large number of apps refreshed, taking you over the 50MB limit and resulting in extra charges. I paid £427 for tickets to Ladies Day at Aintree Race Course in April 2020. When it was cancelled due to Covid, I transferred tickets to the 2021 event but it was axed again. Racing Breaks won't refund me until it has collected funds owed by suppliers. K. C., Liverpool.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investment veteran Matthew Hudson set up MJ Hudson in 2010 as a one-man band that focused on helping fund managers to run their own businesses. Thousands of people in the financial services industry had been laid off during the financial crisis. Many were looking for new careers and Hudson's firm helped them on their way.

The company specialised in back room services like administrative, legal and regulatory support relating to so-called alternative investments, from private equity and venture capital to infrastructure and renewable energy.

Today, MJ Hudson has 300 staff, offices in the UK, Europe and America and 1,200 clients, from small start-ups to giants such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as pension funds, including Lloyds Bank and Marks & Spencer.

Smart move: Marks & Spencer pensions is one of MJ Hudson's 1,200 clients

The group listed on AIM on December 12, 2019, the day of the General Election. The shares were priced at 57p, fell to 38p when the coronavirus pandemic erupted and are now 50p.

The price reflects neither MJ Hudson's performance to date nor its prospects and the stock should rise both this year and beyond.

A lawyer by training, Hudson has spent 33 years advising businesses on alternative investments. Through that time, he has developed a wide network of contacts and an encyclopaedic knowledge of his field.

Hudson is also fiercely entrepreneurial and is determined to build MJ Hudson into a top provider of alternative investment services. The group is well on the way to achieving this ambition in Europe. There is some way to go in America but the seeds have been sown and the outlook is bright.

Hudson has not just expanded into new parts of the world over the past decade. He has also branched into new areas of the market.

From offering services such as legal and administration, Hudson began to offer advice, such as whether pension plans should invest in infrastructure funds and if so, which were the best ones to choose.

In recent years too, the group has developed an analytics division, helping customers to see how they compare with their peers in terms of performance and costs.

The subsidiary also helps fund managers and pension funds with environmental issues so they can assess whether the companies they invest in are as green and responsible as they make out.

This division alone has grown by around 80 per cent over the past year, after Hudson bought a Dutch specialist in the field two years ago. Based in Amsterdam, Spring Associates are so committed to their cause that the owners cycled for 19 hours – from Holland to the City of London – when they first came to meet Hudson.

Four more acquisitions have been completed since MJ Hudson floated and more deals are in the pipeline, all relating to existing areas of business.

The group's financial year ends on June 30 and brokers predict a 35 per cent increase in revenues to £27million, with profits soaring from £0.6million to £2.8million and further strong growth in 2022. Dividend payments are expected to start this year too, with 0.1p pencilled in for the current year, rising to 0.3p next.

Midas verdict: Alternative investments are a niche area of the financial markets but interest in them is growing and MJ Hudson provides a range of valuable services to participants in the sector. Matthew Hudson and his wife still own more than 27 per cent of the business so he is highly motivated to succeed. At 50p, the shares should deliver long-term rewards. Buy.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fund manager Chris Ford admits that there may come a day when the fund he set up and runs is redundant – though not for at least 20 or 30 years.

When Ford and co-manager Tim Day launched Sanlam Artificial Intelligence in 2017 it was the only fund focusing solely on AI.

At that time, most of us were just starting to see the impact in our lives of AI, which uses machine learning to simulate human intelligence.

Fast forward to today and the growing presence of AI in our everyday lives is apparent everywhere from healthcare to online shopping.

'Anyone who watches Netflix or buys a holiday online will have interacted with it,' says Ford.

Fast forward again another 25 years and Ford expects AI to have entered every corner of our lives.

'At that point, the fund may look like any other global equities fund, because AI will have been adopted by all companies around the world,' he says.

'However, the question is how that process will play out and which companies will have the competitive advantage.'

In his search for these winners, Ford looks for companies pushing the use of AI to its limit – what he calls his quest for 'the pointy end of the spear'.

To this end, he invests in a portfolio of 35 to 40 companies based all around the globe. Some are household names such as Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet.

Others are less familiar, such as Japanese robotics company Fanuc and US data storage firm Western Digital.

So far the strategy has paid off. In the four years since its launch, Sanlam Artificial Intelligence has seen yearly growth of 34, 13, 38 and 31 per cent respectively. Ford says he is more proud of the consistency he has offered investors than of the levels of returns the fund has generated.

He believes some of the most exciting uses of AI are in healthcare. 'One of the most extraordinary developments last year came from the AI system AlphaFold, which was developed by Alphabet's DeepMind,' he says. 'AlphaFold is attempting to understand how proteins fold in the body. This will help us to make sense of how diseases come about and form in the body, which will in turn enlighten us about how to treat or prevent them.'

Were this done by people in labs with pipettes, it would take years, Ford explains. But by using AI and machine learning, thousands of proteins can be analysed at once, speeding up the process.

The fund looks not just at the firms developing AI tools, but also those that show willingness and innovation in the way they adopt existing ones.

Ford believes that good use of AI is a strong marker of a company that is likely to succeed. 'For a company to use AI well, it tends to require an open-minded management team, a willingness to innovate and vision.'

UnitedHealth, based in Minnesota, is a good example. Ford says the healthcare firm is using careful curation of its data to slash bureaucracy, refine underwriting, and improve health outcomes for customers.

As a result, it is already worth $400billion and growing its market share. US loan company Upstart, which uses algorithms to measure creditworthiness, is another.

Unsurprisingly, Ford and Day use AI themselves to manage the fund. They employ an AI programme to identify all of the companies in a particular sector and to pick out the ones most likely to succeed.

For example, when they decided to invest in quantum computing, they used AI to search for information about every company in this area, all around the globe and in any language.

They then pinpoint the companies with strong balance sheets. Sanlam Artificial Intelligence Fund has annual charges of 0.52 per cent, and its stock market ID code is BYPF331.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Fund manager Alex Wright is confident he can extract further investment returns from the UK stock market over the coming months – despite the market wobble last week over fears of rising inflation.

He believes the UK market remains extremely attractive despite the strong gains of the past year, while company valuations, he says, are not overstretched.

'I'm still very excited about the market,' he says. 'It still has a long way to go and with two big risks gone away – namely Brexit and coronavirus as a result of the vaccination programme – I'm very much in positive mode.'

Wright is the lead manager of both investment trust Fidelity Special Values and fund Fidelity Special Situations, investment vehicles made famous in the 1990s and 2000s by Anthony Bolton – at the time considered one of the country's most brilliant fund managers.

Like Bolton (now retired), Wright's modus operandi is based around buying unloved stocks in the hope that their share prices will rebound at some stage in the future.

The two funds currently hold near identical stocks, but the stock market listed trust has performed significantly better than the fund over the past year because it has provided Wright with the tools to borrow cheap money and use it to increase exposure to a stock market poised for recovery.

The assets he has bought with these loans have soared in value.

So, in the past six months, Special Values has recorded overall returns of nearly 33 per cent, compared with 26 per cent for Special Situations.

The trust's borrowings account for 13 per cent of its total assets although it was higher at 20 per cent last autumn.

Special Values is invested across about 100 holdings with more than 80 per cent of its £1billion of assets exposed to the UK stock market.

The trust is banking on a strong housing market and a big pick-up in consumer spending in the coming months. It has holdings in a number of housebuilders, both in the UK and also in Ireland – the likes of Redrow and Vistry (UK) and Glenveagh and Cairn (Ireland).

'Housing supply remains low in both the UK and Ireland,' says Wright. 'Yet demand is being driven by the low cost of mortgage finance.

'That in turn is pushing up prices as evidenced by the recent data from Halifax showing average annual house price increases for the UK in excess of 8 per cent.

'Provided these increases don't get into the high teens, they shouldn't pose a problem.'

The trust also has a number of housing-related holdings: including Kingfisher (owner of DIY specialist B&Q), builder's merchant Grafton, consumer products specialist Norcros, and Forterra, the country's biggest brick manufacturer. In addition, it has a stake in estate agent LSL Property Services (owner of Your Move).

The other big 'sector' position is in financial stocks – the trust's two biggest holdings are in insurers Legal & General and Aviva while it also has stakes in Just and Phoenix. 'This is a trust set up to benefit from a recovery in the UK economy,' says Wright.

'Provided the vaccines can be tweaked to deal with any virus mutations that might come our way, I am confident there will be strong growth as the economy opens up.'

The trust's annual charges total 0.98 per cent and the stock market identification code is: BWXC7Y9. Income is paid twice a year and is equivalent to just below two per cent a year.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Young borrowers are unknowingly putting their financial futures at risk, with many unaware about the damaging implications of missing loan or credit card repayments.

More than half (54 per cent) of 16–24-year-olds were unaware that a missed credit payment can impact their score and negatively impact their chances of securing credit in the future, according to research by Compare The Market.

Almost half did not know that their credit score would be checked when applying for a credit card, and 45 per cent were unaware their credit history was also checked when securing mortgages or personal loans.

Some 54 per cent of 16-24 year olds are unaware that missed loan or mortgage payments can impact their credit score, according to Compare The Market

In the wider population, more than two thirds of people knew that credit scores were used to check eligibility for credit cards, and only 71 per cent were aware they were used for mortgages or personal loans.

The research described a lack of awareness among many young people about what specific actions impact credit scores, and found that many were unsure how to improve their rating.

'Credit scores are used by lenders to understand whether a borrower can afford a product and assess their ability to pay it back on time,' said James Padmore, head of money at Compare The Market.

'Certain actions can impact your credit score, either positively or negatively and our research shows that while young adults believe they have a handle on credit, there is a significant knowledge gap.

'Having a low credit score early on in life could unfortunately affect your ability to get a mortgage or a personal loan, for instance.'

More than half of young people did not realise a poor credit score could lead them to being ineligible for the most competitive deals, whether that be a mortgage, personal loan or credit card.

Nearly three-quarters did not realise that registering on the electoral roll could have an impact on their credit rating, while over two-thirds were unaware the length of their credit history could influence their score.

County Court Judgements, Individual Voluntary Agreements and bankruptcy, all of which stay on a credit report for six years, were only known to have a negative impact by 43 per cent of young people.

Be wary of Buy Now Pay Later schemes

Buy Now Pay Later schemes such as Klarna have become a popular form of credit, with five million people using these products during the pandemic, according to the FCA.

These schemes enable shoppers to delay or spread the cost of a purchase over a period of time rather than paying the entire cost in one single lump sum payment at the point of purchase.

Over half of Buy Now Pay Later users aged between 16 and 24 have missed at least one payment on these types of purchases in the last year.

Although most schemes run a soft credit search when a customer makes a payment – which won't show up on an individual's credit report – some products require a hard credit search.

This means if shoppers miss a payment or fail to pay back their debts in time, it could be marked on their credit report and impact their ability to apply for credit in the future.

How can people check their score?

A credit report not only details an overall credit score but also lists a person's credit accounts, such as bank accounts, credit cards, utilities and mortgages.

It will also display their repayment history, including late or missing payments.

Young people will need to see their report first before they can better understand where they can improve.

There are a number of ways to view your rating and history for free.

Experian and Equifax offer 30-day free trials of their service online, but you will need to remember to cancel before the end of the promotion to avoid subscription fees.

Ten tips to boost your rating 1) Register on the electoral roll at your current address 2) Use a credit card responsibly and always try to retain a good amount of available credit 3) Check your credit report regularly and ask for any errors to be corrected 4) Never withdraw cash from your credit card 5) Limit applications for new credit 6) If you have bad credit, stop applying for more credit 7) If you don't have a credit card, then get one - but just make sure you pay it off each month 8) Don't miss repayments 9) Let your credit history mature 10) Don't keep unused cards

Why is it important to improve your score?

Your credit score reflects how reliable you are with credit, and it affects your ability to borrow money.

Having a good credit score will improve your chances of securing a mortgage, credit card or loan in the future and will give you access to better deals.

'I would always recommend you keep tabs on your credit score especially if you are thinking about taking out a mortgage,' said Andrew Montlake, managing director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers.

'Lenders have more difficult credit scoring systems to pass if you only have a 5 per cent or 10 per cent deposit for example.

'It is important to make sure there are no errors on your report and act to improve your score where you can before you come to apply for a mortgage.'

How can you improve your score?

There are number of ways people can improve their score, including by registering on the electoral roll at their current address, using a credit card responsibly and ensuring they don't miss any repayments.

'Just a few small changes can make all the difference to ensure you're accepted for credit later on, such as registering on the electoral roll, not opening too many accounts at once and keeping your credit card balances 25 per cent under the limits,' said Padmore.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@What's happening?

We are beginning to look at life after the pandemic, or rather, more treatments for life after the pandemic.

The Medica Group is a computerised tomography (CT-imaging) and X-ray specialist, and is now seeing a recovery in its scanning business in diagnostic services.

Medica's business is concentrated primarily in the UK and Ireland, with some overseas activity in the US and Australia.

Recovery: Medica's business is concentrated primarily in the UK and Ireland, with some overseas activity in the US and Australia

Not unsurprisingly, the business was hit hard when the concentration was on Covid and other healthcare was put to one side. However, as the storm passes, those other areas are finally picking up.

Why does it matter?

As our leaders erratically bluster their way in the aftermath of the pandemic, the fast-growing list of delayed operations and procedures is now receiving greater attention.

So the group has seen a significant increase in its radiology reporting business. As a measure, 'elective' medical activity is now at 75 per cent of pre-Covid levels.

As the months go by, this pressure to tackle the backlog of medical treatments will grow and so Medica finds itself very well positioned to support and develop its operations here. This is something that no politician can be seen to duck. Its latest business report showed that margins have improved year on year.

With recent acquisitions in both the US and Ireland, the benefits of its increased earnings have yet to be fully reflected in the business figures.

What should I do?

Floated in 2017 at 135p, the shares rose to a peak in June 2017 of 231p.

However, they hit a low of 101p in March last year but have since risen to 172p. To me, this is a company in the right place at the right time. Add in some existing tried and tested products and this tells a good story. Medica has seen strong growth in Ireland, where the increase in scanning is putting pressure on radiology department capacity. Medica's ophthalmology screening contract has turned a strong performance in the first half.

Any suggestions?

Buying small companies is always riskier than larger ones, as they can often be illiquid, which in English means harder to trade. Therefore, the price can be erratic and it is sometimes difficult to find a buyer.

However, bearing that in mind, this looks like a good company to put away for a medium-term hold.

As an alternative you could take less risk by buying into the overall sector of healthcare innovation, via a tracker fund (ETF). One which would fit is the iShares Healthcare Innovation fund, which would allow you to spread your bets.

Capacity limits and a dearth of major films caused by distributors delaying their release meant the UK-based group that operates here and in the US saw ticket sales collapse and it record $515.2million in losses during the period.

Though it raised ticket prices and customers spent more money on average when visiting cinemas, the company, which reports in US dollars despite its UK stock market listing, still saw revenues decline by more than half to $292.8million.

But shares rose today as investors looked to a brighter future without lockdowns and were buoyed by its suggestion that it may split off all or part of its US arm and raise cash with a separate stock market listing for it.

Shush!: A Quiet Place: Part II starring Emily Blunt (right) was one of the most popular movies among the much smaller group of visitors to Cineworld outlets in the first half of the year

In the UK, where the company's cinemas were shut from January to mid-May, only 2.6 million people watched a film in one of Cineworld's establishments, about 7 million fewer than last year.

Its much larger US-based division and trade throughout the rest of the world displayed similar falls in attendance and box office receipts. In total, the firm's admissions plummeted by 70 per cent and retail revenue fell by over £120million.

Yet despite the lack of moviegoers, crowds flocked in big numbers to watch the horror movie A Quiet Place: Part II, Fast and Furious 9, monster film Godzilla vs. Kong, while children's movie Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway was popular in the UK.

Cineworld's losses were around two-thirds lower than the same time last year the coronavirus pandemic brought the motion picture industry to a virtual halt. Shares closed trading 3.9 per cent higher at 63.7p on Thursday.

Now that most capacity restrictions have been lifted, the FTSE 250 business also noted that demand is steadily reviving and is expecting several upcoming releases to provide a boost.

These include the James Bond film No Time to Die, four Marvel Studios productions including Eternals and Spider-Man: No Way Home, the long-awaited Top Gun sequel, and the fourth film of the Matrix franchise.

Cineworld is the world's second-largest cinema chain behind AMC Entertainment, which has been one of the most heavily-traded 'meme stocks' this year following a coordinated effort by traders on Reddit to hurt short sellers.

AMC’s share price has grown by over 1,500 per cent since the start of 2020, and it has taken advantage of this frantic market upswing to initiate numerous equity fundraisings that have helped it raise money and stave off bankruptcy.

Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency expert Begbies Traynor, said continued restrictions and a lack of willingness on the part of cinemagoers means that cinemas are lagging behind in the economic recovery and will have to start thinking of different ways to recover.

She added: 'Recently, it has felt as if Cineworld, and others in the sector, were pinning their hopes too tightly to the release of summer blockbuster films, but these are not for everyone.

'The pandemic has stalled the pipeline of many lower-budget films creating a dearth of range. Major blockbusters are not going to lure everyone; there is a huge customer base of dedicated regular filmgoers that flock to the cinema for the very films that have stalled in production at the moment.'

Hang onto your hats. Aston Martin has taken the top off its Valkyrie hypercar to launch its fastest ever open-topped model to give owners an experience that is as close to being a Formula One driver you can get.

The new Valkyrie Spider has been unveiled on Thursday evening among the super-rich at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in Monterey, California, and takes inspiration from the AMR21 machine used by Aston's official F1 team this season.

Powered by the same 1,155 horsepower petrol electric hybrid 6.5-litre V12 combination in the hard-top version, it accelerates from rest to 62mph in under three seconds up to a top speed of 217mph with the roof on, and 205mph with the roof off.

But it also blows the roof off the prices, too. Lucky buyers will pay a £1million premium for the privilege, with the Spider costing £3.5million compared to the £2.5million asking price for the hard-top version.

Going 205mp with the roof off: Aston Martin has revealed an open-top version of its Valkyrie hypercar - and the Spider will cost £1million more than its hard-top sibling

There is a limited run of 85 cars worldwide with deliveries of both left-hand and right-hand drive models scheduled to begin in the second half of next year.

However, you can put your money away now as Aston Martin says they have already been sold and are over-subscribed following 'unprecedented demand' for the supremely-fast open-top hypercar.

Aston Martin says the new Valkyrie Spider is the 'fastest, most extreme open top Aston Martin to date' and provides 'a thrilling next step in the progression of the Aston Martin Valkyrie bloodline'.

It says the combination of F1-inspired aerodynamics and performance with open roof driving 'epitomises true Formula One car experience, on the road'.

The removable roof panel offers the 'ultimate sensory immersion for driver and passenger' and an 'exhilarating Formula 1 experience on the road'.

Unveiling the car, the British maker - with its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire - told VIP guests in California: 'This a thrilling next-step in the progression of the Aston Martin Valkyrie bloodline.

Powered by the same 1,155 horsepower petrol electric hybrid 6.5-litre V12 combination in the hard-top version, it accelerates from rest to 62mph in under three seconds up to a top speed of 217mph with the roof on, and 205mph with the roof off. Listen to the incredible sound it makes in the video below

'It promises an even more intense experience.

'One shaped by the unbeatable sensory stimulus that comes with roof-off driving in one of the world's most extreme hypercars.

'One that delivers the most comparable experience to that of an F1 car, not limited to the track.'

It said the the Valkyire Spider has benefitted from unique engineering solutions born from the combined talents of Aston Martin and Red Bull Advanced Technologies (RBAT).

The firm said: 'While the Aston Martin Valkyrie's unique 1,155PS hybrid V12 powertrain remains unchanged, the Valkyrie Spider has received revisions to its carbon fibre structure, plus precise recalibration of both the active aerodynamic and active chassis systems.

There is a limited run of 85 Spiders (right) worldwide. However, you can put your money away now as Aston Martin says they have already been sold and are over-subscribed following 'unprecedented demand'

'This is all with an eye to maintaining optimal Valkyrie performance when driven in a roof-off condition'.

It said the key to the Valkyrie Spider's performance is the ultra-lightweight construction and high downforce aerodynamics package.

It explained: 'The upper body surfaces of the teardrop-shaped cockpit and lower tub contours follow the envelope of space available between the huge full-length Venturi tunnels that run either side of the cockpit floor.

'Drawing huge quantities of air beneath the car to feed the rear diffuser, these tunnels are the key to generating Aston Martin Valkyrie Spider's extraordinary levels of downforce, while keeping the upper body surfaces free from additional aerodynamic devices that would spoil the purity of the open-top styling.'

And it boasted bluntly: 'It's the fastest and most extreme open-top, road-legal Aston Martin ever built and is 'simulated to set impressive lap times, not normally achievable in a road-going car'.

Inside the driver has a near-central seating positioning, strapped down by a six-point safety harness to keep the occupants safely locked in place.

The stunning automotive specimen has been unveiled on Thursday evening among the super-rich at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in Monterey, California

A centre rear-view camera system and front- and rear-parking sensors aid the driver at both high and low speeds, with displays sitting just above the instrument panel.

The bespoke, removable lightweight roof comprises of a carbon fibre central panel, latching onto the tub at the rear and to the windscreen surround at the front. It also has a pair of polycarbonate roof windows, hinged on either side.

Aston Martin said: 'On opening the doors, the roof can simply be lifted off and stowed away. Modifications to the carbon fibre tub have been made to support the removable roof panels and the luxury open-top layout, as well as new doors. '

Front-hinged dihedral doors, unique to Valkyrie Spider (right), have been redesigned to tilt forwards and have a more butterfly-like look to them. We'd argue the vertical lifting doors on the hard-top model (left) are more dramatic

Front-hinged dihedral doors, unique to Valkyrie Spider, have been redesigned to tilt forwards.

Speaking at the unveiling, Aston Martin chief executive officer Tobias Moers said: 'The Aston Martin Valkyrie is the product of incredible innovation and technology, but above all it has always been about emotion. With the Valkyrie Spider we are taking that passion and emotion to the next level.

'The driving experience promises to be truly sensational. The sound of that 6.5-litre V12 engine revving to over 11,000rpm with the roof removed is something I cannot wait to hear.'

Red Bull Racing's chief technical officer Adrian Newey added: 'Right from the very beginning of the Aston Martin Valkyrie project we were driven by exacting targets that went way beyond any previous road car and the Valkyrie Spider brings that same ethos to the open cockpit hypercar category.

'What you see is a simple removable roof panel, but the challenge of remaining true to the Valkyrie concept was anything but. Maintaining aerodynamic performance with the roof removed was of paramount importance, likewise keeping any unavoidable weight gains to an absolute minimum whilst maximising enjoyment for the driver.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Those with energy efficient homes could soon borrow up to £12,000 more on their mortgage with one lender - as data reveals the number of green mortgages available has increased five-fold since April.

Data provided by broker Property Master for This is Money shows that the number of green mortgages, across both mainstream residential and buy-to-let, has increased from just 78 products in April to 400 now.

Green mortgages reward borrowers for having a good Energy Performance Certificate rating by lending them more money based on their income, cutting fees or giving them a better interest rate.

Go green: Green mortgages reward those whose homes are energy-efficient

In the latest move to incentivise buying greener homes or retro-fitting existing ones with green improvements, Monmouthshire Building Society is in the process of 'recalibrating' its affordability calculator so that those with EPC A or B rated homes can borrow more than those rated D, E, F or G.

The average EPC rating for homes on its books is a D.

Monmouthshire is currently testing out the new concept on two new-build sites in Wales, and told This is Money that those in the top two bands could borrow up to £12,000 more compared to those in more poorly-performing properties.

Most lenders use Government data on average energy bills to factor in a home's running costs, but this generic data doesn't always accurately reflect the real running costs of a home.

Owning a more efficient home costs less, and in theory leaves the owner-occupier with more disposable income which could be used on a higher mortgage repayment.

Some mortgage experts say this kind of approach to lending is long overdue.

'From a borrowing point of view, it is only right that a client who is buying a property that is going to cost them less to run each month should be rewarded when assessing affordability,' says Matt Coulson, director at broker Heron Financial.

'If they don't need to set aside as much of their earnings to pay utility bills, they should have more left for their repayments.'

Adaptations such as solar panels can improve the chance of getting an Energy Performance Certificate rating of C or above and potentially qualifying for a green mortgage

Most existing green mortgages require the borrower to find and apply for a specific 'green' product.

If Monmouthshire does roll out the new calculator across all its lending, it could be the first to factor in a low EPC rating no matter which product the customer has chosen.

Monmouthshire made the decision after being involved with Valuations And Lending Underwriting Energy Reduction or 'Valuer;' a group of property organisations including Rightmove and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors which are researching ways to link energy efficiency with mortgage lending.

Graham Sumsion, who is the lending operations manager at Monmouthshire Building Society, says: 'The problem we are coming up against is that energy-efficient new-build homes cost more to build, and therefore sell for more, which reduces the market for them as people can't get a big enough mortgage.

'But lenders could consider lending more against these homes, because the buyers' bills will be low.'

Property Master's data shows that the 400 green products are being offered by 19 lenders, taking in the majority of the high-street names.

However, their motives for doing so are not entirely altruistic, as policy changes are on the horizon which will put both individuals and businesses under pressure to lower their environmental impact.

Angus Stewart, chief executive of Property Master, says: 'Basically, what we are seeing here is lenders getting into position to meet the requirements of the Government's net zero policy, which involves a commitment for all domestic properties to achieve an EPC of a C or above by 2035.

'As part of this, mortgage lenders are being expected to ensure by the end of 2030 the average energy performance level of their domestic portfolios is at least EPC C.'

Is it enough to make homeowners go green?

Under pressure to balance their books, more lenders are likely to offer incentives to bring on board those with good EPC ratings.

That is good news for those that already own energy-efficient properties.

Borrowers are unlikely to choose 'green' properties just because they may access a slightly lower interest rate Mortgage broker Gerard Boon

But with the price of eco-friendly new builds, and the cost of retrofitting things like air source heat pumps, still very high, some experts struggle to believe that a slightly bigger mortgage or a marginally better interest rate will be enough to persuade homeowners to buy a greener home or take on significant renovations.

'I do not expect green mortgages and the incentives around them to have a significant impact on demand [for eco-friendly homes,' says Gerard Boon, mortgage broker at Boon Brokers.

'Borrowers are unlikely to choose 'green' properties just because they may access a slightly lower interest rate or a slightly higher affordability.'

However, it may have more of an impact when combined with other motivating factors such as cheaper bills and having no need for renovations.

What about those who can't afford to upgrade their home?

Ultimately, the supply of green homes is still quite limited, and there are concerns that those in older properties will be unfairly penalised if lenders continue to offer preferential treatment.

Katie Brain, mortgage expert at Defaqto, says: 'On the one hand this could mean that borrowers purchasing a low-energy home are able to borrow more, which may be attractive when property prices are high.

'But what about those who cannot afford the price of newer, lower energy properties? This could be seen to be penalising people.'

Incentives aside, the cost of purchasing a low-energy home will be too much for some. Prices are often higher than older properties and retrofitting can also be expensive

Monmouth says it is keen to help people with the cost of retrofitting their properties, by providing further advance loans secured on their homes at a favourable rate.

'We are especially keen to support our members buying homes on net-zero sites, but we also want to help existing homeowners to improve their properties,' says Sumsion.

'As part of the pilot we have gone out and looked at customers' homes and created a pathway for them to get their home to zero carbon.'

While this may help some people on their way to being more energy efficient, taking out a loan is still a big ask when the exact cost benefits are unclear.

Although it is growing quickly, the green mortgage sector is still in its infancy, and little information is available so far on the public's appetite for such products.

There may be a big push by the banks, but whether the average homeowner will bite remains to be seen.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Former pensions minister, Lord Myners, calls Vectura's decision to back the bid from Marlboro tobacco giant Philip Morris a 'garage sale' and one that stinks.

At Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, chief executive, Sarah Woolnough, says it's an outrage.

So do more than 20 other public health bodies, including the Royal College of Physicians, which have written to the board demanding it reject the deal, claiming that it is absurd that Philip Morris can make more money from providing treatments to the people they made ill in the first place.

Kicking the habit?: Should investors believe Philip Morris's stated ambition that it wants to buy Vectura as part of its switch away from tobacco

They also warn that Vectura's research capabilities and recruitment would be damaged by the association with big tobacco.

Even for the silly season of mid-August, emotional responses being provoked by Bruno Angelici's move to back the £1.1billion bid Philip Morris International over that from Carlyle, the private equity fund, are quite something to behold.

In the coming weeks, Vectura's investors will have to decide whether Angelici and his fellow directors are right to be selling out at 165p a share – a 10p premium to the rival Carlyle offer – or to reject the bid.

What should they do? Should they listen to the outraged medics who argue that handing over Vectura's inhalers business – devices created to deliver drugs for illnesses caused by cigarettes – would constitute nothing short of blasphemy? Or should they believe Philip Morris's stated ambition that it wants to buy Vectura as part of its switch away from tobacco, helping it with its long-term plan to be a wellness company. Is that credible? It's certainly a contrarian view and maybe not such a foolish one.

Randeep Somel, portfolio manager at M&G Investments, put the point well when he compared what Philip Morris aims to do by switching from tobacco to inhalers to how big oil has invested in renewables, as BP has done with solar and wind.

Like big oil, the tobacco giants have the capital to invest in new and healthier areas. It's also good business, as these companies know that regulations can only get stricter and they will have to find new areas of growth or wither away.

Shareholders have an alternative: reject the bid and allow Vectura to exist as an independent company. Such a route would be in line with the pressure being placed on asset managers – most recently from the PM and the Chancellor – to back the UK's long-term potential as part of an 'investment big bang' to boost growth and drive recovery.

Vectura has all the right credentials: founded by University of Bath students, it was a spin-out which then floated on AIM, and then graduated to the FTSE 250 Index as business grew fast in the respiratory disease market.

But if you dig a little deeper into Vectura's corporate history, you will see that lately it has not had the easiest of rides. It has gone through at least three mutations of its business model as its big pharma customers have switched from respiratory diseases into more lucrative areas of healthcare such as oncology.

Two years ago, Peel Hunt analyst Amy Walker described it as 'a cash stream in search of growth opportunities' and earmarked the company as a 'strategic takeover' with a target price of 122p on the stock.

Paradoxically, investors might take the view that despite the bizarre ethical situation, Vectura will help Philip Morris withdraw from its nasty addiction.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@London's public markets remain red hot after a multi-billion-pound food business said it will list in the capital.

Olam Food Ingredients is looking to go public early next year in what will be one of the biggest floats in recent times.

The company will raise around £2billion from the float and immediately earn a place in the FTSE100.

Appetite: Olam Food Ingredients is looking to go public early next year in what will be one of the biggest floats in recent times

The decision by Olam is a big win for London as the City looks to attract more world-class companies post Brexit.

The London Stock Exchange had its strongest first half for listings in 2021 since 2014, but faces growing competition from the likes of Amsterdam.

The stock exchange is also under threat from private equity predators, snapping up companies whose valuations have been depressed during the pandemic.

As a result, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is trying to encourage a 'Big Bang 2.0' in the City and so far this year technology giants Deliveroo and Darktrace have come to market.

The float will also give London a much needed boost in the food and beverage space as Cadbury's, United Biscuits and Northern Foods have all been sold off over the past ten years.

Based in Singapore, Olam Food Ingredients works with some of the world's best-known food and drinks brands. It has 15,000 employee, operates more than 100 manufacturing plants, and sells cocoa, coffee, dairy, nuts and spice ingredients.

Anantharaman Shekhar, chief executive, said: 'The primary listing on the stock exchange will give us access to London's large and diverse investor base, with its deep and liquid capital markets, and enable us to benefit from its strong understanding of and research coverage across the food and beverage sector.'

In 2020 Olam posted revenues of £6.6billion and profits of £435m. It is majority owned by Temasek Holdings, Singapore's state-backed investment company, which holds a 53.2 per cent stake, with 15 per cent also held by Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation. It has appointed Citigroup, Credit Suisse, HSBC, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to work on the IPO.

Olam Food Ingredients was created in early 2020 after it de-merged from commodities giant Olam International.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Just over a year ago, we took out a new mortgage to move home – fixing for five years at 1.4 per cent.

In historic terms, that was astonishingly cheap money.

Yet, if I wanted the same five-year fixed mortgage from the same bank today, the rate would be just 1.04 per cent - and if I wanted the lowest five-year fix on the market it would scrape in under the 1 per cent mark, with either HSBC or Nationwide.

Mortgage rates are so low that some could now lock in for five years at less than 1%

I knew back then that mortgage rates were likely to come down further, having witnessed them barely shift despite the coronavirus emergency base rate cuts, but I didn’t have the luxury of waiting. I needed to buy the house.

And, in all honesty, I didn’t think they’d fall quite this far within a year – particularly as last summer people were expecting the property market to tank rather than boom.

And yet boom it did. House prices have jumped and a temporary stamp duty cut added fuel to the fire.

Meanwhile, lockdown savings fortified some people’s finances, leading to less bad debts inflicted on banks than expected, and more firepower for those with itchy feet for moving home.

This has meant that 18 months into a global pandemic, we find ourselves in the odd position of banks and building societies that battened down the hatches now slamming into reverse.

The mortgage battle that was being contested before the pandemic and lockdowns struck is back on. And while small deposit borrowers aren’t yet fully feeling the love, those with hefty deposits or equity are being offered the cheapest rates ever.

Those cheap rates are a key ingredient in house prices at levels that are almost as expensive as they have ever been compared to wages.

The question being asked is how much lower rates can go? In this comprehensive look at why mortgage rates are falling and how low can they go, Helen Crane canvassed mortgage experts and brokers’ opinions on that.

Some reckoned the current cheapest 0.83 per cent two-year fix (with Halifax through selected brokers, or 0.87 per cent elsewhere) might already be near rock bottom, while others suggested we could be headed all the way down to 0.5 per cent.

The steady grinding down of mortgage rates to their current record lows has allowed house prices to remain almost as expensive as they have ever been compared to wages

Time will tell, but for now borrowers will be wondering whether to grab one of these cheap deals or bide their time.

Those moving home will have little choice on that – in almost all circumstances they have to take the rates on offer that fit their transaction timing – but remortgagers have a bit more flexibility.

Yet, with rates already so low, a few percentage points here or there often don’t make a huge difference.

Even in my case where rates have dropped a full 0.4 per cent, the saving proved to not be as much as I thought it could be.

The best five-year fixed rate we could get today is 0.99 per cent, and that would theoretically save us £72 per month, or £3,456 in total over the remaining four years.

This is nothing to be sniffed at, it’s always worth trying to save some money, and I’d rather we had that money than the bank, but it’s not enough to consider sucking up a roughly £16,000 early repayment charge and switching.

We are lucky to be more than a decade into home ownership and have never extended the term when we moved home or remortgaged, so despite the eye-watering size of our mortgage the rate difference is cushioned.

For those with longer terms, rate differences will be greater, and it might be worth considering switching, but check your early repayment charges, all other fees and compare rates properly first.

The real win is for those on standard variable rates, who are likely to have no early repayment charges, and could potential save substantial sums.

The question I ponder though is whether the next time I remortgage or move rates will be lower than the one I am on now?

To be honest, I hope not. Because alongside the steady grinding down of mortgage rates has come a burst of house price inflation that makes moving home more expensive, hampers the economy, and harms those hoping to own their home.

I’d gladly take higher mortgage rates and lower house price inflation.

The 36-year-old is preparing to release a new album in which every song will be named after a man in the music industry she says has previously taken advantage of her.

But The Mail on Sunday has learnt that at least one of the men – a senior figure in the music industry himself – is planning to openly challenge the singer's claims.

One friend of the individual confirmed that he would not be attempting to prevent Allen from releasing the song about him.

Lily Allen (above in July) is facing a bitter row with a man she accuses of sexual abuse. The 36-year-old is preparing to release a new album in which every song will be named after a man in the music industry she says has previously taken advantage of her

The Mail on Sunday has learnt that at least one of the men – a senior figure in the music industry himself – is planning to openly challenge the singer's claims. One friend of the individual confirmed that he would not be attempting to prevent Allen (above in 2014) from releasing the song about him

But the friend said he would be making evidence available which, he claimed, would cast doubt over claims he was in an abusive relationship with the singer.

'If Lily wants to make these allegations in her songs, she must be prepared for very serious claims to be challenged,' said the friend.

'There will be no legal move made to prevent the release of this particular track. But the person being accused of committing these acts is convinced they have the evidence to disprove the allegation. They are prepared to fight fire with fire.'

Ms Allen spoke in 2018 about being sexually assaulted and claimed that she woke up in bed with a record industry executive during a work trip.

She said: 'I woke up at 5am because I could feel someone next to me pressing their naked body against my back. I was naked, too.

'I moved away as quickly as possible and jumped out of the bed, full of alarm… I found my clothes quickly… and ran out of his room and into my own.'

Lily Allen recently revealed she is two years sober, has made her West End debut in the play 2:22 A Ghost Story, and is happily married again, to US actor David Harbour, 46. (Above together in June)

The mother-of-two has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in her life over the past few years following the collapse of her first marriage, and claims she was struggling with a hedonistic lifestyle that threatened her health and her career.

She recently revealed she is two years sober, has made her West End debut in the play 2:22 A Ghost Story, and is happily married again, to US actor David Harbour, 46.

Allen initially revealed she was self-funding her hotly awaited new music album, but she has now been signed to the BMG label, which will put out the release later this year.

She has previously alleged that sexual abuse is 'rife' in the music industry and too many people are still silent on the issue, despite the flourishing #MeToo movement.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A schoolboy spent more than a decade living off nothing more than white bread and Munch Bunch yoghurts before being diagnosed with a food phobia.

Ashton Fisher, 12, from Norfolk, would become scared and tearful if he was fed anything other than Warburtons sliced white bread and strawberry and banana Munch Bunch yoghurts.

In July he was diagnosed with an Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), which his civil servant mother Cara, 49, believes might have been triggered by having reflux as a baby.

Ashton Fisher, 12, from Norfolk, would become scared and tearful if he was fed anything other than Warburtons sliced white bread and strawberry and banana Munch Bunch yoghurts.

Parents Cara and James were worried about their son's lack of nutrients but said he wasn't able to eat anything else. Pictured, Ashton with his parents and brothers Oliver and Tom

After spending time with a psychologist, Aston has started to introduce more food into his diet, including sandwiches, roast dinners and McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. Pictured, Ashton eating a yoghurt (left) and a roast dinner after seeing the psychologist (right)

After spending time with a psychologist, Aston has started to introduce more food into his diet, including sandwiches, roast dinners and McDonald's Chicken McNuggets.

Cara, who is married to husband James, 52, said: 'We've been so worried about him as he doesn't get any of the nutrients he needs.

'But he physically hasn't been able to eat anything else as he'd have horrendous panic attacks.

'We've never had Christmas dinner as a family as Ashton couldn't stand the smell. It's been a living nightmare.

Over the years, the worried parents brought Ashton to his GP but they described him as a 'fussy' eater.

What is avoidant/ restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and how does it affect people? Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) ARFID is when someone avoids certain foods, limits how much they eat or does both. Beliefs about weight or body shape are not reasons why people develop ARFID. Possible reasons for ARFID include: negative feelings over the smell, taste or texture of certain foods

a response to a past experience with food that was upsetting, for example, choking or being sick after eating something

His aversion to food left Ashton feeling secluded as he wouldn't eat at school or at parties.

Cara and James tried to help him change his habits when he was younger but her wasn't mentally prepared and didn't want to change.

Cara said: 'He was referred to see a dietician which was a complete waste of time as we knew what he should be eating but he was scared to eat it. They just didn't understand and basically said he would grow out of it.

'Until recently, Ashton has been fine because he doesn't know any different. But his peers in secondary school have noticed he doesn't eat and it has become awkward for him. He doesn't want to be different.'

The family went to see selective eating disorder specialist Felix Economakis, who is a Psychologist who uses hypnotherapy, in July 2021. He diagnosed Ashton with ARFID.

Cara adds: 'Everything made sense when Felix told us about the condition. We always knew Ashton wasn't just a "fussy" eater. He used to freeze when we tried to give him something else to eat. His face would fill with fear.

'He gets through a loaf a day but he is now willing to have ham sandwiches after seeing Felix. He has also tried a roast dinner, Pringles and McDonald's chicken nuggets.

'Ashton looked so proud of himself for trying something new. It is still early days but things are looking good as Felix has given him the confidence to try new things. He now understands that the food isn't going to make him vomit.'

Cara is sharing her son's story to raise awareness of the condition.

She said: 'It isn't spoken about enough. It's a shame that you have to pay for the service but doctors aren't aware of ARFID. It is a psychological problem and the same as a phobia of spiders.

'Giving a person a plate of food other than their 'safe' food is like giving them a plate of maggots or fish eyes, it fills them with fear and they can't eat it. It's a shame that hypnotherapy sessions aren't available on the NHS.

'ARFID is very difficult for both the sufferer and parents, but I want others to know there help out there. This condition doesn't only affect children, adults suffer from this too and more help is needed.'

Felix said: 'My job is all about being able to put the client at ease once they feel understood, validated and listened to.

'Then it's about leading their focus towards a productive goal and defusing the resistance, obstacles, wrong information in the way.

'I anticipate the usual objections and so can pre-empt them.

'People's concerns fall into typical categories, for example, what if I gag or throw up or what if I don't like the taste of new food.

'By having answers prepared it's very easy to reassure them quickly by proving how gagging can be stopped or how to cope with new tastes.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In fall 2020, more than one million students left U.S. public school systems - with remote-only districts seeing the most substantial drops.

Remote-only districts saw a 42 percent higher enrollment decline, overall, compared to those offering in-person options, according to an analysis from Stanford University and the New York Times.

Kindergarten-aged students and those in rural areas were particularly likely to leave the public school system due to their districts opting for remote-only school.

The report demonstrates the importance of getting students back to school in person, even as the Indian 'Delta' variant drives surges.

Over one million students left U.S. public school systems in fall 2020, a new analysis finds. Pictured: Summer students in New York City, July 2021

Remote-only districts had a 42% lower enrollment decline than in-person districts and hybrid districts

Over the past year, researchers, educators, and parents alike have learned that remote learning is detrimental for K-12 students.

While keeping kids out of classrooms was a key mechanism for preventing COVID-19 spread - especially early in the pandemic - research has shown that Zoom school was bad news for both students' academic abilities and mental health.

The shift to remote impacted students in a way that worsened pre-existing divides. Students of color, low-income students, those in rural areas, and others with fewer resources were less able to weather the transition.

Despite these issues, many students did not go back to school in person during the fall 2020 semester.

In the fall of 2020, over half of U.S. public school students only had access to remote learning. Many of them stayed remote through the entire school year.

A new study shows that many of those students who didn't have access to in-person learning dropped out of the public school system entirely.

For the analysis, published online on August 7, researchers at the Stanford Graduate School of Education collaborated with Big Local News - a project of Stanford's Computational Journalism Lab - and the New York Times.

The researchers examined school enrollment across six years, from the 2015-2016 school year to the 2020-2021 year.

They used enrollment data from state and federal sources, paired with reopening information from Burbio - a data research platform that tracks districts' learning modes.

The analysis included a total of 875 districts representing about 35 percent of public school students.

Overall, the researchers found a sharp enrollment decline in fall 2020 compared to the previous year.

Nationwide, enrollment fell by two percent - a loss of 1.1 million students.

Kindergarten students in remote-only districts were more likely to leave the public school system than their older peers

'Public school enrollment typically increases from year to year, but it fell sharply in the fall of 2020,' said Thomas Dee, Stanford Graduate School of Education professor and one of the study's authors, in a news release.

'We found that districts that adopted remote-only schooling had significantly larger enrollment declines than those that offered face-to-face schooling.'

Specifically, the districts that offered face-to-face options saw a 2.6 decline in enrollment overall, while those that offered only remote saw a 3.7 percent enrollment decline.

That means a 42 percent higher enrollment decline for the remote-only districts.

The researchers also found a dramatic difference in kindergarten enrollment. They estimated that, overall, remote-only districts saw a ten percent enrollment decline in kindergarten students.

This decline was especially high in states where kindergarten is optional - many parents opted to skip the grade and enroll their students in first grade the following year.

Enrollment declines were also higher for remote-only districts in rural areas.

'So there's still a lot to be learned about this,' Dee said. 'For example, access to high-speed broadband and digital devices may influence how parents in rural communities judged the appeal of remote instruction.'

In addition, the researches found higher enrollment declines for remote-only districts serving more Hispanic students - and fewer black students.

The analysis indicates that many parents prefer in-person learning. Pictured: Students head to class on the first day of school in Anaheim, California, August 2021

The researchers note that some parents may have taken their children out of public school because they wanted an in-person option - while others may have been in the opposite situation, wanting virtual-only and not finding that provided.

But overall, the study indicates that many parents prefer in-person learning - to the point of taking their kids out of schools if remote is the only learning mode available.

The findings support many districts' decisions to return to in-person learning in fall 2021, even as the Delta variant drives Covid surges across the U.S.

Still, last year's enrollment drop could have long-term implications for the districts that lost students.

Many students who skipped or delayed kindergarten last year will now be entering schools, Dee said. This will lead teachers to have bigger classes with a mix of ages.

Other, older children may have to navigate the impacts of catching up on coursework.

'These results also suggest an imminent fiscal challenge to public schools if student enrollment doesn't rebound,' Dee said. 'My best guess is that many of these students aren't returning.'

'As parents confront the uncertainty of the coming year and what their local public schools will offer, they may view their new accommodations as a safe harbor.'

Jake, 24, who confessed to Lib, 21, that he loved her during Friday's episode, found out from Toby Aromolaran that the girls were doubting the sincerity of his feelings.

Toby told Jake that people were thinking his 'I love you' revelation was a 'cop out' to avoid the rocky week him and Liberty had just faced.

'I need to get out of this place!': Frustrated Jake stormed out of the villa on Sunday night after the girls doubted his feelings for Liberty

Growing increasingly frustrated, Jake snapped: 'I need to get out of this place.'

The water engineer stuck to his word and, despite a concerned Toby following him, he sat on a wall outside the villa to collect his thoughts.

The couple have been together since day one of this year's series, and have even made it official.

However Liberty had her doubts after it was revealed Jake wasn't sexually attracted to her in the movie night challenge, and continued to act icy towards her in the Villa.

Being honest: Toby told Jake that people were thinking his 'I love you' revelation was a 'cop out' to avoid the rocky week him and Liberty had just faced

Stressed: The water engineer stormed out of the villa to collect his thoughts

The girls had earlier voiced their concerns about Jake's feelings to a smitten Liberty, who was delighted to tell the girls about her conversation with her beau in which he'd revealed he loved her.

Chloe Burrows responded to her frankly: 'You're going to hate me. Do you not think he's telling you what you want to hear?'

In the conversation with her pals, Liberty looked round at all of them to ask: 'Is that what you all think?'

To which Faye Winter tentatively replied: 'I don’t know baby.'

Unsure: The girls had previously voiced their concerned about Jake's feelings to a smitten Liberty, who was delighted to tell the girls about her conversation with her beau in which he'd revealed he loved her

Supporting her friend: Faye told Jake in an honest chat that it was the 'worst' time he could tell her Liberty loved her

Liberty seemed a little confused, and asked for advice from her friends: 'Do you think I’m being an idiot?'

Chloe told the beauty: 'I don’t think he would say something if he didn’t mean it but I also think is it convenient that he said it this evening after all of this?'

Chloe and Faye were later pulled for a chat by Jake, who revealed to Toby and Teddy that he wanted to know 'who the f**k' had questioned his feelings for Liberty.

In an honest yet calm chat, Faye told him: 'Tonight was the worst time to tell her you loved her,' to which he replied, 'I totally understand.'

Once again, Jake and Liberty managed to iron out their issues.

Referring to his confession of love, Jake gushed to his girlfriend: 'I've been waiting to say those words for a long time.'

A more relieved-looking Liberty said: 'I trust you to believe that you meant it.'

More to come: Jada exclaimed in the caption: 'I always said I would get a sleeve at 60 but tomorrow is not promised. Soooo … I’m starting to build my sleeve now!' Seen in 2020

Pinkett-Smith's new tattoo was inked just above the tattoo that she got in May along with her daughter Willow, and mother Adrienne 'Gammy' Banfield-Norris. The trio all got matching tattoos of three blossoming lotuses.

Jada showcased the ink on her Instagram account, where she shared photos of the tattoo process followed by the finished product.

The ink was done by tattoo artist-to-the-stars Dr. Woo, and the process was all documented on their hit Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk.

'Now I want a sleeve!' Jada Pinkett Smith, her daughter Willow, and mother Adrienne 'Gammy' Banfield-Norris all got matching lotus tattoos representing their three generations

All three women received tattoos of three blossoming lotuses, from bud to fully grown.

The three different tattoos varied slightly in design, with Jada and Adrienne opting for a small flowers sprouting in a downward direction while Willow opted for a larger design that bloomed in an upward trajectory.

'Look what we did!!! Thank you @_dr_woo_ for your patience and generosity of your craft and spirit. Now I want a sleeve!!!!' Jada captioned the slideshow.

Willow pitched the lotus design several days prior to their tattoo appointment on their show.

Flower power: All three women received tattoos of three blossoming lotuses, from bud to fully grown

Significant: Willow said the tattoo had spiritual and familial significance

'I thought that was brilliant': Adrienne was a fan of Willow's interpretation of the tattoo design

'You know what we could get? A lotus,' Willow said, as her mother and grandmother expressed their approval.

'I'm down for that!' Jada said.

The tattoos were a long time coming, with Willow and Adrienne previously expressing their interest in getting one done before Jada finally committed and got an appointment with Dr. Woo.

Girl power! Jada shared an embrace with her mother as they savored the special moment

Deep meaning: Willow revealed the tattoo 'expresses the spiritual journey but also the three of us'

As Willow got her tattoo done, she explained the significance of the flower.

'The lotus represents spiritual enlightenment,' Willow said. 'And we hear this saying, "through the mud grows the lotus."'

'That's definitely my story,' Adrienne chimed in.

'Yes, 100%, and I think all of us from different perspectives in life have had that journey,' Willow continued. 'The bud to the little blossom to the bloom, also I feel like expresses the spiritual journey but also the three of us. I'm the youngest, you know my mom is the middle and Gam is the fully-bloomed lotus.'

Tatt's enough! Adrienne sat for Dr. Woo as he tattooed her arm

'And it means something different for each of us,' Adrienne added. 'Our stories, our journeys, are different. But it still represents us so well. I thought that was brilliant.

'"Out of the mud comes the lotus." You have to go through the mud, the dirt and still something beautiful is created,' Adrienne said. 'And that kind of describes my journey. I kind of been through some really tough times.

'But I'm still worthy, you know, and there's still room for me to grow and change even now, at 67. I'm still growing and changing and trying to be better. So getting the lotus was just everything.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Crypto mining firm Argo Blockchain saw first-half profits skyrocket 2,000 per cent thanks to a boom in the price of digital currencies and an expansion of its operations.

The London-listed company saw pre-tax profits grow from £500,000 in the first half of last year to £10.7million in the past six months, as revenues almost tripled to £31.1million, from £11.1million.

It comes as Argo Blockchain has benefited greatly from the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies seen this year, with its shares rising from just 5p a year ago to a record of around 300p in February.

Booming profit: Crypto miner Argo Blockchain said

The price of bitcoin, the most recognisable cryptocurrency, hit a record high of above $60,000 in mid-April, although it halved to below $30,000 in late June after a crackdown on mining by China.

Today, bitcoin was trading 1 cent higher at around $45,000, while ethereum was down around 0.9 per cent to $3,090.

Mining is the process through which companies like Argo Blockchain create new cryptocurrencies.

They do so by adding transaction records to a cryptocurrency's public ledger of past transactions, or blockchain, through specialised computers.

It currently takes around 10 minutes for powerful computers to mine bitcoin, which is the most commonly mined crypto.

The energy consumed in doing so is more than that used in the whole of Argentina, according to estimates by the University of Cambridge.

Argo Blockchain has been expanding its operations, with a new mining facility in West Texas announced in April.

It said its mining capacity increased from 685 petahash at the end of last year, to 1,075 petahash at 30 June.

Stellar ascent: Argo Blockchain shares went from around 5p last year, to 128p today

The firm also reported a mining margin of 81 per cent, a sharp rise from 39 per cent the year before.

But the total number of bitcoin and equivalent mined in the period fell to 883 from 1,669 last year, which the company said was due to bitcoin 'halving' in May, which made the crypto more difficult to mine.

Halvings take place every time 210,000 blocks are mined, occurring roughly every four years.

Meanwhile, Argo's bitcoin holdings jumped to 1,268 coins at the end of June, from 127 the year before.

But the company said China's crackdown on mining caused 'an unprecedented drop in global hashrate and mining difficulty' in the industry.

But it added: 'We believe Argo is well positioned to capitalise on the emerging trends in the market through its large and highly efficient mining infrastructure and experience.

'The group will also continue to manage growth through the expansion of the size and quality of its mining infrastructure, as well as strategic opportunities that leverage its leading market position.'

Shares in Argo Blockchain fell 2 per cent to 128p in afternoon trading today, continuing their descent from the record high of around 300p they hit in February.

However, the company's shares are still around 2,500 per cent higher than a year ago, when they were trading at just 5p.

Chief executive Peter Wall said: 'We have capitalised on a change in market conditions in the first half of 2021 to deliver strong growth in both revenues and profits, demonstrating that our smart growth strategy is delivering value to shareholders.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@SSE powered its way to the top of the FTSE 100 following reports that activist investor Elliott Management has amassed a stake in the firm.

Rumours have been circulating for several days before gaining steam at the weekend, with speculation now mounting that Elliott could launch a campaign to force an overhaul if it finds it hard to engage with bosses.

This has been the New York hedge fund’s modus operandi for years – famously urging Whitbread (down 0.2 per cent, or 5p, to 3193p) to spin off Costa Coffee.

Sparking interest: Rumours have been circulating that activist investor Elliott Management has amassed a stake in big six energy supplier SSE

The reports have all said it is not clear how big Elliott’s stake is or what it is intending to do.

But it has also fuelled more chatter over whether SSE, which runs gas power plants, wind farms and electricity networks, could also be a takeover target.

SSE wants to become a leader in renewable power, and sold its household energy arm SSE Energy Services to challenger group Ovo Energy in 2020 for £500m.

SSE shares soared 5 per cent, or 77.5p, to 1623.5p. Elsewhere, water groups Severn Trent and United Utilities gained after Australia’s Macquarie bought a £1billion majority stake in Southern Water, which received a record fine for sewage pollution a few weeks ago.

Stock Watch - Bluejay Mining Investors piled into Bluejay Mining after it teamed up with a billionaire-backed group to explore for metals used in electric cars. As reported in the Mail yesterday, Kobold Metals – which receives funding from investors including tech tycoons Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio – will pay more than £11million to hunt for critical resources including cobalt, copper and nickel on Greenland’s west coast. Kobold will have the option to take a 51 per cent stake in the Disko-Nuussuaq project. Bluejay soared 17.8 per cent, or 1.67p, to 11p.

The deal has fuelled talk that overseas investors could have other water firms in their sights.

Severn Trent rose 0.9 per cent, or 24p, to 2794p and United Utilities by 0.7 per cent, or 7.5p, to 1063p.

A bumper day for the FTSE 100’s utilities groups did eventaully boost the wider index after a slow start to the day.

The Footsie closed up 0.1 per cent, or 9.35 points, to 7132.3, while the FTSE 250 went the other way, falling 0.01 per cent, or 2.72 points, to 23453.44.

Trading was partly muted after disappointing data from China, which added to concerns that the spread of the Delta variant could be weighing on Asian economies.

China’s July trade numbers showed exports grew by 19.3 per cent – a high-sounding number that was actually the lowest this year and below expectations.

Imports also sagged, rising 28.1 per cent, down from 36.7 per cent in June.

The Delta outbreaks also hit the oil price.

Brent crude dropped 3pc to $68.70 a barrel, as any potential lockdowns in China could severely hamper overall demand as it is the world’s biggest consumer.

Craig Erlam of trading platform Oanda said: ‘The fact that China is already importing lower numbers of crude, as well as other commodities like iron ore and copper, doesn’t help the outlook or prices.’

The Footsie’s oil majors mostly shrugged the price drop off, however, with BP falling 0.7 per cent, or 2p, to 305.45p and Shell by 0.8 per cent, or 11p, to 1456p.

Bitcoin hit a three-month high, rising 3 per cent to climb above $46,000. It is the first time it has crossed the $45,000 mark since mid-May.

London-listed bitcoin ‘miner’ Argo Blockchain yesterday reported that first-half revenues had surged by 180 per cent to £31million, as the company benefited from an astonishing rally that later fizzled out in May. Profits ballooned from £500,000 to £10.7million.

But it appeared that much of this had already been priced in, as Argo’s shares fell 0.8pc, or 1p, to 130p by the close.

Page Group’s stock also suffered, tumbling 3.2 per cent, or 20p, to 603p, on the back of results.

The FTSE 250-listed recruiter said turnover had risen to £766million, up from £655million from the same period of last year, and it would pay out a 4.7p dividend.

But boss Steve Ingham warned there was still a ‘high degree of global macro-economic uncertainty’ and that there were still Covid restrictions in ‘a number of the group’s market’.

The chief executive said this made it hard to tell if improvements were the result of pent-up demand or a sustainable trend.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lloyds Banking Group shares leapt almost 13 per cent today on hopes of a Brexit deal.

But that was a rare bit of sunshine in an overwhelmingly gloomy year for the millions of UK investors who hold Lloyds shares.

Despite the fact that Lloyds shares pack a dividend yield of 6.2 per cent, trade on a lowly forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7, and can be bought for less than they are worth, with a price-to-book value of 0.8, they are deeply unloved.

Even after today's bounce, Lloyds shares are down about 20 per cent on where they stood before the Brexit vote and a third below there 2015 peak.

While Lloyds is considered the most UK economy-focused of Britain's big banks, its rival big names are out of favour too, with HSBC, Barclays and RBS all firmly off investors' wish lists.

Britain's banks should be doing well at this point in the economic cycle, but are instead suffering from a double hangover, induced first by the financial crisis and then Brexit.

So, is this a chance to profit, or a value trap for investors? Simon Lambert, of This is Money, and Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, take a look.

Investec raised the rate on its Online Flexi Saver this week to 0.58 per cent on a minimum £5,000 investment, while Paragon Bank’s new Limited Edition Easy Access pays 0.46 per cent on £1 or more.

There are also providers paying up to 0.6 per cent, but these accounts often come with a catch.

Savings rates on easy-access accounts have crept up to 0.6 per cent for the first time in nine months

Some include a bonus which makes the rate look better. This usually lasts for a year before disappearing to leave you earning as little as 0.1 per cent unless you move your money.

Others restrict how often you can take money out and charge savers if they exceed their limit.

But they can offer a better deal for savers with cash they don’t need to access urgently.

Money is still pouring in to easy-access accounts, while the amount in current accounts also soars.

Savers have £943.8billion sitting in easy-access accounts, according to the Bank of England’s figures.

The average rate earned is 0.1 per cent. There is also £242billion in current accounts earning no interest.

Meanwhile, the amount in fixed-rate bonds has fallen by nearly 10 per cent to £150billion. Skipton Building Society’s Triple Access Saver pays 0.6 per cent.

But you are limited to three withdrawals a year and you have to keep a minimum of £5,000 in the account. If you make further withdrawals, you must close the account. It is available online, through its branches, by post and you can open it over the phone if you have a working email address.

Coventry BS’s new LimitedAccess Saver (Online) pays 0.55 per cent but you can make six free withdrawals a year. You can make more but there is a charge equal to the amount of 50 days interest — or 75p per £1,000. The society runs a similar account through its branches, paying 0.5 per cent.

Accounts with bonuses paying 0.5 per cent or 0.6 per cent include online deals from Cynergy Bank, Leeds BS, Saga, Tesco Bank and Marcus by Goldman Sachs. There are no withdrawal restrictions on these.

Cynergy Bank raised its Online Savings rate to 0.6 per cent last week. It includes a 0.3 percentage point bonus payable for one year.

After this, the rate falls to 0.3 per cent. Tesco’s new Internet Saver at 0.5 per cent includes a bigger 0.4 point bonus for 12 months.

Leeds BA Limited Online Access account pays 0.5 per cent but only until August 31 next year.

If you don’t want to have to worry about moving your money when the bonus runs out, the best value comes from Marcus by Goldman Sachs.

The bonus is 0.1 per cent for a year and means your rate will only drop to 0.4 per cent after.

The best easy-access account in branches with no bonus or withdrawal restrictions is the 0.36 per cent from Kent Reliance.

The decision sparked outrage among the UK's medical chiefs and physicians who were shocked that the inhaler maker, which helps people with respiratory problems, could succumb to US tobacco giant, Philip Morris International (PMI).

City grandee Lord Myners last night also condemned the deal, branding it a 'garage sale' and saying the bid saga 'stank'.

Appalled: City grandee Lord Myners, a former chairman at Marks & Spencer, branded the Vectura deal a 'garage sale', saying the bid saga 'stank'

Vectura's board accepted the offer on financial grounds as it values the firm at £1.02billion. This is more than a bid of £958million from US private equity firm Carlyle.

Myners is a former chairman at Marks & Spencer who saved the company from falling into the hands of Philip Green.

He said the chairman and directors of Vectura should never have engaged with either of the takeover offers.

'The board should have rejected the first offers, instead they put their head in the noose. Boards in this country lack stomach to produce better long term value.

It is a fact of life now, any UK cash offer [at a premium] above 30 per cent and the investment banks tell the board to accept. Game over.'

He added: 'It doesn't happen in other countries. It's like a garage sale. We are selling off our scientific leadership. It's a tragedy and the Government just watches as all our scientific knowledge is bought up.'

Founded in 1997 by students from the University of Bath, Vectura is one of the UK's leading science companies.

Philip Morris wants to get its hands on the firm to transform itself into a 'health and wellness' firm. Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said they were 'extremely shocked and concerned'.

She added: 'PMI makes billions from making addictive products that can cause and exacerbate lung diseases. It's totally absurd that they could make more money from providing treatments to the very people they have made ill in the first place.'

Vectura shareholders will vote on the deal on August 24.

British fashion designer Sir Paul Smith has created a 'stripped-back' electric Mini that marks the start of a new collaboration and prepares the way for an expected 'special edition' runaround for customers.

The clothes designer has applied his eye for a stylish sharp suit to create the one-off back-to-basics version of the new green zero-emissions Mini that also encapsulates his trademark 'classic with a twist' philosophy – using cork, recycled plastic and a few surprises.

The 'Mini Strip' is described as 'a custom-made, one-off model' created to showcase the car-maker's green credentials and – with his signature on the dashboard - is given its world premiere today at his boutique in London's Mayfair.

Asked directly if it paves the way for a subsequent Paul Smith designer car for paying customers to buy, he teased: 'Watch this space'.

Mini Strip: This is the one-off custom Mini Electric created in partnership with British fashion designer, Sir Paul Smith, which has an interior made from recycled plastics and cork

Asked directly there will be a production version of the unique Mini Strip, Paul Smith said customers should 'watch this space'

The Mini Strip marks the second collaboration since 1999 between Mini and designer Sir Paul whose designs combine tradition and modernity.

He first collaborated with Mini with a limited-run special edition of the classic Mini.

The car was painted in a special shade of blue and sported neatly coordinated anthracite alloy wheels.

Also popular was a one-off creation - painted in Sir Paul's signature multicolour stripes - to mark the classic Mini's 40th birthday.

But it has also sparked a car fashion war, with British designer Stella McCartney signed up to do a similar job for Audi's electric e-tron range.

Sir Paul said: 'A few years ago I did a striped Mini. This time I wanted to have a more radical approach to designing the car – a stripped out Mini.'

He said the covid pandemic had left many people question the complexities of life and longing for more simplicity and sustainability: 'The world is getting too complicated. It is telling us: sort it out.'

Cork is used for the dashboard topper pad, door shoulders and parcel shelf and is fully recyclable as it contains no synthetic binding agents

He said he brought a fashion designer's eye, 'child-like naivety' and a fresh perspective to the task of 'shining the spotlight on the issue of sustainability in automotive design and manufacturing'.

He said he used his own trademark blue on the stripped back Mini which he believed looked 'absolutely fantastic'.

The car showcases 'inspirational ideas' for a more sustainable method of automotive design focussed on the overarching themes of: 'simplicity, transparency, and sustainability', he said.

Working with Mini's chief designer Oliver Heilmer the pair stripped down the Mini Electric to its 'structural essence' – then added only elements viewed as absolutely necessary.

Mini says cork 'could provide a substitute for foamed plastics in future'. It also 'fixes' carbon dioxide during its production giving 'potential for reducing greenhouse gases.' Sir Paul noted: 'Cork is very good acoustically and thermally. It's not bad for the top of a bottle of wine either'

The car was painted in a special shade of blue and sported neatly coordinated anthracite alloy wheels

With the exception of the dashboard, topper pad and parcel shelf, all trim parts have been stripped out, turning the exposed basic body-shell and vivid blue paintwork into the dominant visual feature of the cabin: 'It is bare yet feels 'dressed' at the same time,' he said.

But it comes with a classic 'Paul Smith' twist of unexpected details designed to delight.

Sir Paul explained; 'I'm a clothes designer, not a car or product designer. I like cars but I can't tell you much about them. I'm not a car-holic. But I've driven a Mini for 20 years.

'It's the joy of naivety where you are not cluttered by detail. The joy of having a child-like approach means you can be more radical. So I thought 'what if?'.

Bicycle enthusiast Sir Paul – who enjoys rolling up his sleeves occasionally and replacing or modifying his road bikes himself – provided the inspiration for the visible screws which show how simply the car could be dismantled and recycled at the end of its life.

Visible interior cable routing draws attention to functions normally concealed during manufacture and a large transparent panoramic roof made from recycled Perspex allows a view of the largely bare body-shell structure inside

The raw body was left in its unfinished state with no coloured paint applied, but instead just a thin film of transparent paint to protect against corrosion

The full interior of the Mini Electric donor car had to be removed in order to paint the shell a deep shade of midnight blue

Scratches, imperfections and 'distressed' elements are kept 'to indicate its hand-made and raw' nature.

The raw body was left in its unfinished state with no coloured paint applied, but instead just a thin film of transparent paint to protect against corrosion.

Grinding marks from the factory were consciously left on the galvanised steel panels to clearly identify the car as a functional object. Smith dubbed this intentionally rough-hewn effect: 'the perfect imperfection'.

Parts of the Mini have been 3D-printed from recycled plastic and their basic material qualities have been left exposed - like the metal panels.

Explaining other key touches Sir Paul pointed out that the interior is stripped of both leather and chrome. The floor mats are made from recycled rubber.

Opening the doors reveals the signature Paul Smith stripes in a vivid composition of five colours

Sir Paul said his working tile for the project was 'MT' – as in 'empty' – and expressed his aim of 'emptying out' the existing car: 'It's a minimalist design. Less is more'

Opening the doors reveals the signature Paul Smith stripes in a vivid composition of five colours.

The charging flap opens to reveal a splash of neon green. The engraved drawing of an electric plug on the flap is Smith's own work.

Interior pull-handles in the door are made from twisted bright orange mountaineering rope (matching the seat-belts) and the door panels made from mesh expose the door structure.

Cork is used for the dashboard topper pad, door shoulders and parcel shelf and is fully recyclable as it contains no synthetic binding agents.

Mini says cork 'could provide a substitute for foamed plastics in future'. It also 'fixes' carbon dioxide during its production giving 'potential for reducing greenhouse gases.'

Sir Paul noted: 'Cork is very good acoustically and thermally. It's not bad for the top of a bottle of wine either'.

The simplified dashboard consists of one large, semi-transparent section with a smoked-glass finish.

In the absence of a central instrument display, the driver's smartphone becomes the media control centre.

Simple toggle switches are the only physical interior controls - for the power windows and the start/stop function. Sir Paul said he likes simple up and down toggle switches but hates complicated screen menus: 'It's the joy of simplicity. One night in Korea I had to throw a blanket over a TV set because I couldn't switch it off.'

Smith's collaboration with the British car maker dates back more than two decades

The steering wheel is made from scratch in aluminium and been reduced to essential functions. The rim is wrapped in bicycle handlebar tape 'in true road bike style'. Three aluminium spokes connect the rim to the impact absorber, whose mesh covering exposes the airbag behind.

A small, fabric Paul Smith label – as in his suits - in the one o'clock position celebrates his collaboration.

Visible screws indicate how easy it would be to dismantle to recycle the aluminium.

Seats are upholstered in a fully-recyclable knitted fabric and the side airbags in the roof pillar are exposed.

Visible interior cable routing draws attention to functions normally concealed during manufacture and a large transparent panoramic roof made from recycled Perspex allows a view of the largely bare body-shell structure inside.

Door openers are milled aluminium and housed in the cork door shoulders provide a high-class finishing touch.

Distinctive front and rear apron inserts were manufactured using 3D printing to produce their striking texture.

The blanked-off radiator grille and wheel covers are made from light recycled Perspex to help reduce drag and increase range.

Sir Paul said his working tile for the project was 'MT' – as in 'empty' – and expressed his aim of 'emptying out' the existing car: 'It's a minimalist design. Less is more.'

He explained that , just as with his clothing and suits where he would have a classic design on the outside, the lining inside would usually have a flash of extravagance and colour.

Seams and stitching are another chance to show some extra flare – both in his suits and on the Mini: 'Most of the action happens on the inside,' he said.

'I know and love the existing car, but by respecting the past and looking to the future we have created something very special,' Smith told us

Explaining other key touches Sir Paul pointed out that the interior is stripped of both leather and chrome. The floor mats are made from recycled rubber

Smith said: 'I feel very privileged that the Mini team have given me the confidence and freedom to think laterally about the approach to the design'

Some elements are a nod to his love of cycling and to the thrift inspired by his father:' I was brought up as a kid making do and getting by. It's a very interesting approach.

'My father was a very practical man – always in his garage and workshop and doing things by hand.

'We put the actual fixings on the outside of the car. That's why there are visible fixing points on the Mini as a nod to those days.'

In looking for ideas he admitted his office table was 'full of amazing and crazy things', most of which he discarded. But he said: 'You have to be brave enough to say: 'No, no ,no – wow- and pick the one that works. That spark is the start. It's so nice to have this zing that wakes us all up.'

As a designer with a passion for bicycles, books and more, Sir Paul said: 'I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to rethink the iconic Mini.

'I know and love the existing car, but by respecting the past and looking to the future we have created something very special.

'I feel very privileged that the Mini team have given me the confidence and freedom to think laterally about the approach to the design. Together, I think we have created something truly unique, by going back to basics, reducing things down and stripping the car.'

Head of Mini design Oliver Heilmer said: 'It shows in an impressive way that Mini and Paul Smith share the same bold way of thinking about the future in terms of innovation and design - and together we create more. We are proud to have developed such a strong character statement together.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The economic and social divide between the North and the South of the UK has widened over the past three years and is continuing to grow, new data suggests.

Increases in household income, a decline in the rate of women claiming job seeker’s allowance, and rise in the proportion of ethnic minority workers employed in the region have all contributed to higher social and economic prosperity in the South.

However, the North has become less prosperous as a result of falling household incomes, fewer small businesses and lengthier journeys to get to work.

'Lifeblood of the UK economy': The report highlights the importance of small businesses to the local economy

This is according to Mastercard's new 'inclusive growth score' for the UK, which aims to draw a comprehensive economic and social picture of communities across the country.

It does so by analysing 21 different social and economic indicators - ranging from housing affordability and broadband speed to access to public green space, clean air as well as small business representation and commercial diversity.

And it shows that so far in 2021, the south of the UK has an average growth score of 54 out of 100, marking an improvement from a score of 53 in 2018.

But the North scores lower at 48, with the region's economic and social situation having worsened since three years ago, when the score was 49. The Midlands has a score of 51.

'This disparity between scores is evidence of inequality in social and economic prosperity between the regions and highlights the need to rebalance the country,' the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth said.

The data show the importance of diverse worker representation for communities' prosperity

The report highlights the importance of small businesses to the local economy, with micro and small businesses accounting for 50 per cent of total revenue generated by UK businesses and 44 per cent of the labour force.

Kelly Devine, president of UK & Ireland at Mastercard, said: 'Small businesses are the lifeblood of the UK economy and their success is crucial in driving sustainable, inclusive growth in communities.

'In the UK, Without small businesses, local communities would suffer from a lack of local employment opportunities and the government’s levelling up agenda would be impossible to achieve.'

She also said it was 'vital' that communities had diverse worker representation if they were to be 'truly inclusive'.

'This is key for post-pandemic economic recovery as it’s estimated that £24billion could be added to the UK economy if racial disparities in the labour market were addressed.'

Leeds, Manchester and Preston buck the northern trend...

While on average southern areas are more prosperous than northern regions, there are some cities in the north of England that have bucked the trend with better-than-average growth.

Leeds, for example, scored 55 this year, driven by increases in ethnic minority worker representation and overall community wellbeing.

Similarly, Manchester scored 53 in 2021 despite the economic challenges presented by the pandemic, with this down to increases in education accessibility and access to healthcare.

Manchester scored 53 in 2021 despite the economic challenges presented by the pandemic, with this down to increases in education accessibility and access to healthcare

Preston, a city in Lancashire known for the 'Preston model' of sustainable economic development and experimentation in 'community wealth building', also scored above the average at 53.

Andrew Western, Greater Manchester councillor for digital, work, skills and apprenticeships, said: 'In Greater Manchester we know social and economic inequalities are a significant barrier in helping us achieve our ambition that our city-region become one of the best places in the world to grow up, get on and grow old.

'The Mastercard Inclusive Growth Score is an important tool in aiding our understanding of what support is needed locally to nurture inclusive, economic, and social growth, helping us to drive improvements to make things better for our people across Greater Manchester.'

... While Bath, Canterbury and Exeter buck the southern trend

There are also some southern cities where the score is lagging behind the regional average, including Bath which scored 48, and Canterbury and Exeter which each scored 45.

In both Bath and Canterbury, the decline was due to decreases in public green space and accessibility of education, while Exeter saw prosperity decline as minority worker representation and small business both fell.

Devine said the findings could help policymakers and community leaders 'uncover and prioritise' areas where more support is needed.

'The range of indicators provide a comprehensive view of conditions in an area and help local policy makers make decisions that meet the specific needs of communities and residents through community projects, affordable housing, and investment in local businesses,' she added.

The report comes as the government recently reiterated its commitment to 'level up' the country, closing the gap between depressed areas of the UK, mostly in the north, and London and the south-east.

The data used is collected from publicly available sources such as Office for National Statistics and HM Land Registry, as well as from Mastercard.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The City's top lobby group is working on a secret project to help London win more business and overtake New York as a financial centre.

TheCityUK, which lobbies on behalf of a swathe of City giants, is drawing up recommendations for Government to boost the 'competitiveness' of London as a place to do business after Brexit, according to sources close to the plans.

The new strategy, which could be published as early as next month, will make a series of proposals on crucial issues including trade policy, regulation and investment into the UK.

A source involved in the ambitious project said: 'It's ultimately about why firms should base themselves in London.'

Writing on the wall: A report by New Financial said the US 'is the world's top financial centre by a wide margin' based on financial data such as the number of companies being floated

It is understood that TheCityUK is consulting with a number of trade bodies including UK Finance, which represents the banking industry.

The move comes as New York powers ahead as the world's biggest financial hub. London lost the top spot in a ranking of global financial centres in 2018, with New York moving ahead, according to thinktank Z/Yen.

A report by New Financial said the US 'is the world's top financial centre by a wide margin' based on financial data such as the number of companies being floated.

Firms have raised $84billion (£60.5billion) in the US on the New York and Nasdaq exchanges this year to mid-July, compared with $12.7billion in the UK, according to consultancy EY.

The report concluded that the UK is 'by far the largest' financial centre in Europe, but warned that rivals in Asia are 'catching up fast'.

The report added: 'It is too early to capture the impact of Brexit on international financial activity but the UK's lead in key sectors such as foreign equity trading and foreign bank assets will already have been dented.'

A separate report has warned that London's position as a top City for financial services is being 'challenged' by Asia.

The UK struck a trade deal last year with the EU after Brexit, although this excluded the services sector, which represents about 80 per cent of the British economy.

Some British policymakers are concerned that the UK is losing certain types of business to New York and parts of the EU.

London last month reclaimed its title as Europe's top share trading hub after briefly losing its crown to Amsterdam following Brexit. The boost came after London opened its doors to trading in Swiss shares when it ditched an EU-wide ban on Swiss stock trading.

A boom in amateur share trading by people spending extra time at home because of Covid-19 has also buoyed British markets.

Policymakers are concerned that Britain could lose out to New York and China unless reforms to the City are quickly adopted.

The Government has commissioned sweeping reviews of the City to modernise the stock exchange and attract more fast-growing technology companies and entrepreneurs.

A review led by former Worldpay boss Ron Kalifa found that the US Nasdaq exchange attracts 40 per cent of companies going public, compared with just 5 per cent in the UK.

There is also mounting concern that Europe is planning to take some of the trading of complicated financial contracts away from London and shift it to Paris or Frankfurt.

A report in May said that £2.3trillion of monthly trading in these contracts has left the UK and gone to New York and cities in the EU.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A judge on the Irish version of television show Dragon's Den has launched a CBD brand Pureis, which has managed to hook two household names as ambassadors.

Lady Chanelle McCoy stepped away from her family business – Galway-based Chanelle Pharma – and joined forces with business partner Caroline Glynn to launch the brand.

CBD has become a growing industry in the last decade. Essentially, it is the second most prevalent of the active ingredients of marijuana.

Irish Dragon Den star Chanelle McCoy claims she's launched the first clinically safe CBD food supplement and says she's proud to set a benchmark for compliance

Depending on who you ask, it has health benefits - but the jury is out, and while the industry is in its infancy, there are varying degrees of quality products to buy in Britain.

It can now be found in a range of items, from cans of drink to drops, gummies to oral sprays.

Caroline has serious credentials. She has worked with Chanelle in the pharmaceutical industry for 11 years and holds a degree in pharmacology and a masters in biomedical science.

Her aim is to make CBD products mainstream, while at the same time ensuring that her products meet regulatory standards.

As such, she claims that Pureis is the first CBD company in the world to receive a Validated Novel Food Application from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Food Standards Agency UK (FSA).

It took 18 months and £1.5million in investment to complete a full suite of clinical studies in the UK and Irish market to meet and satisfy the EFSA and FSA UK.

Chanelle says: 'From the beginning of this journey, it was vital to us that we brought products to market which were backed by clinical studies.

'This enabled us to give our customers the necessary reassurance that they are receiving, high quality, full certified CBD products.

'Novel Food Approval is a positive step in the right direction for breaking the stigma around CBD in the market.

'Only through industry taking the lead can this stigma be addressed. We are proud to be setting a benchmark for compliance.'

The Pureis products, which include capsules and oral sprays, are now stocked in over 1,000 retailers including many pharmacies, Boots and Holland & Barrett.

Chanelle says its best-seller is a 560ml spearmint oil product. 'You take under the tongue. We've had good feedback so far and it retails for £50.'

Lady Chanelle McCoy (left) joined forces with business partner Caroline Glynn (right) to launch Pureis CBD products.

For those who feel £50 is too steep for an initial outlay there are some entry level price points.

Chanelle says: 'There are currently 11 products in the range. For £10 you can try the capsules for seven days before you make a bigger financial commitment.'

Accessing safe CBD

The business partners say they started researching the market back in 2015 when they heard about people struggling to access CBD.

Some consumers even went so far as to purchase the products from abroad where countries had regulated its use.

This prompted the duo to set up Chanelle McCoy Health – an R&D-led pharmaceutical company to make it more accessible in the UK and Ireland.

CBD products must meet certain standards to be legally bought and sold in the UK.

However, she says there are still many CBD products on the high street that aren't properly authorised.

CBD products must also not contain more than 0.2 per cent THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) – a psychoactive compound in cannabis.

There's plans to expand the Pureis brand into the European and US market as well

Chanelle says that Pureis is one of the few products on the market that guarantees zero per cent THC, meaning it does not cause a 'high' and is not addictive.

We have gone one step further on phase two efficacy studies to prove it clinically works and not just from anecdotal evidence Lady Chanelle McCoy, co-founder, Pureis Lady Chanelle McCoy, co-founder, Pureis

The pair say the purpose of the Novel Food application, announced by The UK Food Standards Agency in February 2020, was to ensure safety by way of clinical studies and compliance within the CBD industry so that consumers could have access to safe CBD and purchase products with confidence

Chanelle points out that prior to the classification, the vagueness of the law gave way to an unregulated sector with issues of quality assurance, plant contamination and illegal levels of THC.

She adds: 'Due to its unique production method, the product has high levels of CBD with no intra batch variability, no toxins or pollutants, no terpenes, no heavy metals, no pesticides, and no insecticides.'

The Pureis products range in price but some supplements can be bought at an entry level of £10 to try out before making a major financial commitment

Challenges of promoting Pureis

Besides meeting regulatory standards, other challenges for the business has included the stigma surrounding CBD products and the advertising restrictions.

Chanelle says: 'There's a lot of people that haven't tried it. Around 55 per cent of the products have illegal levels of THC. The fundamental problem with the market is that people want to try the products but they get disillusioned over CBD.'

Chanelle says that they're currently running a trial on the products to establish their effectiveness with sleep

People are also concerned about the efficacy of CBD products.

Chanelle says she and her business partner studied CBD's effectiveness when it came to difficulties with sleep, arthritis, anxiety and menopause.

They are currently running a clinical trial on Pureis' effectiveness with sleep. She says: 'We have gone one step further on phase two efficacy studies to prove it clinically works and not just from anecdotal evidence.'

In spite of all the efforts to make the product clinically safe there are restrictions on advertising.

But Chanelle and the Pureis team have got around that by getting the product promoted by celebrity ambassadors which include former England rugby captain turned royalty, Mike Tindall and singer and television personality Martine McCutcheon.

Tindall, who is married to the queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall and had a son born in March this year endorsed the Pureis product a few months ago saying it helped him nod off.

According to reports he takes 560mg oil at night and 20mg capsules in the morning. He tweeted: 'So go be onboard, good sleep, positive times ahead!!!'

McCutcheon, meanwhile, has claimed it has helped with her CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) and fibromyalgia saying on Instagram: 'I wasn't sure about using CBD, then a few months ago I tried Pureis and it really helped me with my aches and pains and my general well-being.'

Chanelle says she and her husband, jockey AP McCoy, take the product too.

She says: 'I take the oil at night and on my way to London now I've taken the low dose spray. It does not take the edge off. You know you're never going to be sleepy so it's great for general coping.'

The next step

While Chanelle, like the other Dragons on the popular show, is renowned for grilling candidates on their business acumen and figures, she's keeping Pureis' performance under wraps for now.

What she is willing to reveal, however, is that the business is now profitable after 18 months and that it's grown its turnover by 100 per cent month on month.

Lady Chanelle McCoy says she and husband, jockey AP McCoy, take the product too

She adds: 'We've put a lot of money in, which we have paid for.

'We have no debt and are looking to bring in more investment into the business towards the end of the year. We are talking to pharmaceutical companies that have expressed an interest and to individuals.'

The bigger plan for Chanelle and her business partner is for Pureis to venture into the medicine and cosmetics space.

Chanell says: 'We have a very exciting RND pipeline and different products like CBD tampons, but we want to put the clinical data behind it. We want the trust.'

Geographical expansion is on the cards too with ambitions to enter the European and American market.

Chanelle says: 'We are in poll position to be the first to get a European license to launch CBD food supplements. We expect to get the license in the second quarter of next year.'

With regards to the US there is still a few hurdles to overcome. For instance, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) haven't yet regulated CBD food supplements.

Chanelle explains: 'If you pick up a [CBD product] box it will say "CBD supplement" and not "food" and it won't give you instructions to take it orally as it's illegal to do that. This is even though they have legalised marijuana.'

But she says they're in positive discussions with the FDA.

While the market for CBD products is a saturated one, Chanelle believes there is still lots of potential.

But she feels the only way to be truly successful in this industry is to comply with regulatory guidelines.

She says: 'There's 750 brands in the UK and four of us are on the Government approved list. So that just tells you how uncompliant other brands are. Get on the list and then you have huge potential.'

Her advice to budding entrepreneurs? 'Do what you love, watch your cash and have a good strategic plan. Stick to it, but make sure you can adapt as well.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It has been a tough 18 months for investors in stock market-listed fund Jupiter Emerging & Frontier Income. The trust's share price fell sharply as the pandemic struck, from a high of £1.12 in January 2020 to below 70p in late March. To compound the shareholder misery, the quarterly dividend was cut from 1.2p a share to 1p.

Yet there are now signs that the worst is over for shareholders. The trust's share price is back above its £1 launch price in May 2017 while fund manager Ross Teverson is confident that at some stage in the near future, the dividend can be tickled up again.

'The revenue picture for the trust has improved as the impact of Covid on companies and markets has waned,' he says. 'I anticipate growth in dividend payments.'

As its name implies, the £65million trust invests in companies listed on some of the world's emerging stock markets such as China, India and South Korea. Yet it also seeks out opportunities in some of the globe's developing countries that, in stock market and economic terms, are considered too embryonic to be described as 'emerging' – hence the 'frontier' label.

Currently, some 15 per cent of the trust's assets are classed as frontier and Teverson believes such companies provide the opportunity for investors to make good long-term profits – especially given many of the businesses are poorly researched by analysts. This sometimes leads to good companies being undervalued.

'Kenya is a classic frontier market,' says Teverson. 'It has a young population and there is a low penetration of financial products and consumer goods. But the economy has the potential to deliver strong long-term growth.'

The trust has a holding in KCB Bank that offers customers a full range of financial products including savings accounts, insurance and credit cards.

Another frontier holding is Romanian wine producer Purcari that has vineyards in both Romania and Moldova. 'It's a producer of good quality wine,' says Teverson. 'It's benefiting from growing consumption in its home markets, and also from healthy exports to China.'

Although the pandemic has made it impossible for Teverson and the rest of Jupiter's emerging markets team to visit the companies they hold, he says the management of businesses such as KCB Bank and Purcari have been keen to inform them on a regular basis how they are faring.

More difficult has been identifying new investment opportunities, especially in nascent industries, where the ability to do due diligence on the ground is key.

It's meant the trust making more conservative investments in businesses with a track record of revenue growth.

Examples include Egyptian white cheese manufacturer Obour Land – and Taiwanese semiconductor company Elan.

Indeed, Taiwanese-listed 'tech enabling' firms represent the most dominant theme in the trust. A fifth of the fund's assets are invested in Taiwanese companies and the likes of Samsung Electronics, Mediatek, Hon Hai Precision and Taiwan Semiconductor are among the top ten holdings.

Despite the enforced dividend cuts, the trust is still offering an attractive income equivalent to more than 3.5 per cent a year. And if Teverson's prognosis on the future for dividends is correct, payments could be on the rise sooner rather than later. The trust is invested in 45 companies across 22 stock markets.

The fund's stock market identification code is BDR0575 and its ticker is JEFI. The annual charges total 1.35 per cent which are on the high side, but these should fall if the trust's assets grow.

The athlete announced the launch of her online shop Serena back in 2018.

She wrote: 'They say life is about timing. I learned this lesson at age 18, when I chose to play a light tennis schedule because I wanted to go to fashion school. Some criticized my decision, but I knew I had two loves - tennis and fashion - and had to find a way to make them coexist.'

'After 15 years of false starts, and people in fashion telling me 'no', it only only drove me to work harder. As a result, I discovered what it meant to invest in myself, and I allowed that belief in myself to drive me to reach my dream.

Serena hasn't played since hurting the leg at Wimbledon. She slipped on wet grass during a first-round match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus and was forced to retire.

'Unfortunately, I will not be playing in the Western & Southern Open next week as I am still in recovery from my leg injury at Wimbledon,' said the 20th-ranked Williams, who won the event in 2014 and 2015. 'I will miss all of my fans in Cincinnati whom I look forward to seeing every summer. I plan to be back on the court very soon.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@On a sunny Tuesday afternoon last week, I attended a vaccine hub at a primary school in North London for my Covid jab. Unremarkable, you might think: I'm 25, and roughly three in five Britons in my age group have had their first shot.

But unlike most people my age, this was, in fact, my third dose. I had my first in May and my second in June.

No, I'm not some special case who's getting an early booster. In fact, I'd rather not have had it at all. Quite aside from anything, I spent a good few days afterwards feeling really rough. But I felt I had no choice.

You see, I was one of roughly 20,000 Britons trapped in limbo, having volunteered to be a vaccine guinea pig.

The experimental jab I had works – blood tests confirm I'm teeming with antibodies. But it hasn't yet been approved by health chiefs, and the green light might not be for many months.

As most reading this will know, as soon as you've been jabbed it's logged on your medical records. If you have the NHS app – as very many of us do – it appears on there, magically, as proof. And you can wave this at a passport official, nightclub bouncer, or anyone else who wants to check your vaccine status.

But as my vaccine is still in the trial stages, the fact I have been jabbed has not been recorded – leaving me in a strange grey area: vaccinated, but with little way to prove it.

Ethan Ennals rolls up his sleeve to receive the jab… for the third time this year

For months I've been asking the researchers if they've resolved this problem. Every time I got the brush-off: 'We're going to sort it out, we're on it.'

Eventually I lost faith. And so I've taken matters into my own hands. And I am not alone. I'm on a Facebook group for trial volunteers, with thousands of members, and just about every person I've spoken to on that has decided to do the same.

Many didn't wait for as long as me and are now double-jabbed – or, should I say, quadruple-jabbed.

Why does any of this matter? Well, firstly, let's say it's not the most ideal situation to be in – we're essentially going out on a limb, having more than two doses.

It's an uncontrolled experiment, although having done my research I wasn't too worried (as I'll explain later).

But more than that, it means none of us can now be used to gather data for the trial. As we've broken protocol and had extra jabs, the researchers will no longer be able to use our blood samples as part of their research.

It's a huge waste of our time, and theirs, and of money – trials cost many millions of pounds to run.

And without wanting to sound too grand, it's a loss to the huge effort going on around the world to beat Covid.

Also given that in some poorer countries with little or no access to vaccines they're having to dig new burial grounds to accommodate the bodies that are, literally, piling up, it seems particularly wrong that we seem to be wasting ours due to red tape.

I signed up for the trial – for the Valneva jab, developed by a French company and produced in Scotland – in late April, on a whim as much as anything.

Given my age at that time, an approved vaccine would not be available to me for several more months. I was regularly commuting into the office, as well as seeing older family members, and of course, like anyone, I wanted peace of mind. But more than that, I was curious.

As a health journalist I write about medical trials every week, for everything from Covid to cancer. So I wasn't worried. In fact, I was excited by the prospect of experiencing one first-hand. The offer of £300 for my time also sweetened the deal.

I went in for my first appointment on May 5, and after blood tests and filling in forms, I received my first jab of Valneva. It was a painless experience.

The nurses and doctors were incredibly friendly, and the side effects, which I was instructed to record daily on an app, were minimal. Four weeks later I returned for my second jab, which was as simple and easy an experience as the first.

At this point I was feeling even more confident in my decision.

Before signing up, I'd done my research.

As most reading this will know, as soon as you've been jabbed it's logged on your medical records. If you have the NHS app – as very many of us do – it appears on there, magically, as proof. And you can wave this at a passport official, nightclub bouncer, or anyone else who wants to check your vaccine status

The Valneva jab is unique among Covid vaccines. Unlike other shots, which use genetic fragments of the Covid virus, the Valneva jab contains the whole, inactivated virus, much like flu and hepatitis A vaccines.

As it has more parts of the virus for the immune system to learn from, experts hope it will be more variant-proof than the others.

Early trial results of 150 patients also showed the vaccine produced a strong immune response.

I believed my choice was not only helping develop a vaccine that could save hundreds of thousands of people, but was also protecting me from the virus, allowing me to live a life free of Covid anxiety. But it wasn't long before I realised the implications of what I'd done.

As European nations began to reopen after long winter waves of Covid, it became increasingly clear that travel would require proof of vaccination.

Early on, France and Portugal were among the nations to announce that only fully vaccinated foreigners could enter.

The problem was that, according to these nations, despite my two jabs, I am not vaccinated at all.

Many countries in Europe accept only vaccines that have been approved by the EU. This means that anyone vaccinated with the Chinese Sinovac, for example, does not meet the European standards of vaccination and so would be denied entry to countries such as France and Portugal.

But it also means that anyone on a vaccine trial does not meet the criteria, because their vaccine is, by its very nature, experimental, and therefore unapproved.

The issue first came to my attention when, in June, I spoke to a woman named Sharon Magee, a 55-year-old administrative worker from Barry, South Wales.

Sharon had joined another British trial, for the American-made Novavax vaccine, in November 2020. But by June she said she felt 'abandoned' by scientists after she realised her holiday to Grenada was now in jeopardy because she was still, officially, unvaccinated.

She says: 'At my age, I could have had an approved vaccine in April. I felt discriminated against, just for doing something which was meant to help others.'

Several days after my conversation with Sharon, the Government addressed the issue directly. In a letter to vaccine-trial volunteers, Britain's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said 'participants in well-regulated clinical trials should also not be disadvantaged as global travel resumes'.

However, he was unable to give any assurances.

The luxury of avoiding quarantine after returning from amber-list countries is reserved for those who have had two jabs. From tomorrow, the double-vaccinated will also be exempt from isolation after coming into contact with a Covid-positive person.

Then there's the domestic situation. At the moment, clubs, pubs, restaurants and sport venues are allowed to refuse entry to those who are unvaccinated or can't produce a recent negative Covid test. Some are doing this, some aren't.

But there are MPs pushing to make this a legal requirement from September. And so people like me might end up locked out, along with the anti-vaxxers.

I didn't come to the decision to break from the trial lightly.

It wasn't that I was particularly worried about having a third and fourth dose of a different vaccine – trials have already been done into the safety of booster doses, and also mixing and matching vaccines. I felt a responsibility to see through what I'd signed up to do. I knew that if I joined the ever-growing band of dropouts I'd potentially be impacting how quickly a life-saving effective vaccine became available. But with each day that passed, and the app still showing 'no record', I felt more and more hopeless.

America – where I have family – is currently not allowing entry to any foreigners. But when it eventually reopens its borders, it almost certainly will require proof of full vaccination.

Already, thousands of Americans who were involved in the initial AstraZeneca trial, carried out more than a year ago, are in the same boat as the UK Valneva and Novavax volunteers – unable to prove their vaccination status because the Oxford jab has not been approved in the US.

At the beginning of August, Valneva sent us all an email saying there was still no 'timeline' for when all this would be sorted out. The firm did offer to pay for 'a maximum of two' Covid tests, should we want to travel outside the UK. This would not even cover a trip to and from a green-list country.

When I told doctors on the trial what I was thinking about doing, they privately said they would do the same.

For Novavax volunteers, the situation is even worse. Since many volunteers received both jabs before the beginning of 2021, they have now gone more than eight months with no proof of vaccination. This is even though the all-important stage three of the trial has been concluded, and expansive results have been published detailing the clear effectiveness of the Novavax vaccine. The vaccine is 90 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic infection – the same protection provided by the Pfizer jab.

Trevor Davis, 70, a retired psychiatrist from South London, joined the Novavax trial in October 2020. Like me, he was compelled by curiosity.

He says: 'I figured it was unlikely to do me any harm, but it might do me some good and give me some protection at a time when there weren't any vaccines approved yet.'

Unlike Valneva volunteers, Novavax trial participants were not paid for their time, which, looking back, Trevor says 'really annoys me'.

He started to worry when the approval was pushed back twice, first in March then in May.

'Around May, I visited the clinic at the hospital and it was all everyone was talking about. 'Any day now it's going to be approved,' all the nurses and doctors were saying.

'Then it didn't happen and we were told it would be autumn instead. For me, all credibility was lost then.'

Trevor says his biggest worry was unrelated to travelling abroad, but having access to a booster jab.

'At my age, I definitely will need a third dose and currently I have no way of proving I've had two already. I feel like a ghost in the machine. I had this worry that I'd be passed by when the boosters came around.'

In late July, Trevor visited a walk-in vaccination clinic to have his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. He says he lied to get it: 'I'd heard from lots of other Novavax patients who'd been turned away when they tried to get an approved jab.

'I didn't want to take that risk. A few hours later I saw the Pfizer jab show up on my app. I felt very relieved, and I'm counting the days until my next dose – which will be my fourth dose – in three weeks' time.'

I did not have to lie to get my first Pfizer vaccine. When I arrived at the hub, I announced that I was a vaccine volunteer.

They were initially unsure about jabbing me – but in the papers I signed before starting the trial, it states that we're allowed to have an approved vaccine from eight weeks after having our second dose of Valneva.

I showed them this document, and they called The Royal Free Hospital, in London, where the trial is being run. They confirmed it was OK, and so I had my dose.

As I've said, there's no danger in having more than two vaccines. 'If anything it will give you an even more powerful immune boost against the virus,' Professor Penny Ward, a medicines expert at King's College London had told me previously. The only worry was that all the antibody activity could lead to quite intense flu-like side effects.

'The Pfizer and Moderna jabs are pretty punchy as it is, so add those on top of two other jabs and you're going to feel a bit rough,' she warned.

And boy, was she right. Within 24 hours of my Pfizer, I was completely floored. Nausea, chills, aches. It really was the works. But it was all worth it.

On Friday I felt back to normal. And now when I log in to the NHS app, I have the proof I'm going to need: Name of vaccine: Pfizer Ltd. Batch number: FE3380.

Four months and three jabs later, I am finally officially (semi) vaccinated. I just wish it had happened some other way.

WHAT TO EAT

Your diet can also help you lose weight, says nutritionist Lola Biggs (togetherhealth.co.uk).

Avoid hidden fats like sauces and dressings that can pile on the pounds. These are dense in carbs, fats, sugars and calories. Flavour your food with healthy homemade dressings using lemon, honey, mustard and apple cider vinegar.

Apple cider vinegar contains acetic acid, which may reduce body fat accumulation, and is a brilliant addition to salads and roast veggies.

Cutting out alcohol is one of the quickest ways to lose weight from your waist due to its empty calories.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Anyone given China's Sinopharm Covid vaccine should get a third booster dose, claim scientists.

Real-world data from Peru, which has used the jab, shows two doses only cut the risk of infection by 50.4 per cent.

The findings, published by the South American country's Ministry of Health, said the vaccine's efficacy at stopping infection was 'not high'.

Boosters should therefore be considered, the researchers said.

However, the data also showed the jab was still in the region of 94 per cent effective at cutting the risk of death.

It comes amid a debate on whether booster are needed in Britain, where protection against infection after two doses of the AstraZeneca or Pfizer jab varies between 65 and 90 per cent.

The study of 400,000 healthcare staff in Peru found that Sinopharm is just 50.4 per cent effective against infection. Meanwhile, latest estimates from Public Health England revealed Pfizer to be 70 to 90 per cent effective and AstraZeneca to be 65 to 90 per cent effective at stopping infections

Sinopharm's vaccine was just 50.4 per cent effective at preventing infections in a study of around 400,000 double-jabbed healthcare workers led by scientists at Peru's National Institute of Health

Why are vaccines always better in clinical trials? Before vaccines are approved by health authorities and rolled out to the population, they must go through rigorous clinical trials that estimate how effective they are. Researchers recruit volunteers as part of randomised controlled clinical trials to test jabs. Initially, just small numbers are given a vaccine to test their safety, before it is rolled out to the hundreds and subsequently thousands if the initial trials have been successful. But findings from trials are not always reflected in the population, because they only provide a snapshot of the general population. For example, vaccines are often given to healthy young volunteers who are monitored for a short period. When vaccines are rolled out to the general population and given to different age groups or those with underlying health conditions, the effectiveness of the jab can be different. In the UK, Public Health England issues weekly updates on the effectiveness and safety of the Covid vaccines used in the UK. But the UK also uses data from other countries to assess the impact of the jabs, such as evidence of the link between myocarditis - an extremely rare heart condition side effect that has been linked to the jabs - to determine vaccine policy in the UK.

Academics at Peru's National Institute of Health and two other institutes monitored nearly 400,000 frontline medics who had the BBIBP-CorV vaccine, which is made by Chinese state-owned drug firm Sinopharm. Most were double-jabbed.

Experts examined data on the jab's effectiveness from February to June in Peru when the country was dealing with a second wave.

BBIBP-CorV has been approved for use in some countries in South America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.

Healthcare workers in Peru were the first to get a Covid vaccine in the country, and were all given Sinopharm's because it was the first jab to arrive in the country.

Peru has since vaccinated some people with AstraZeneca and Pfizer.

And countries including Cambodia and the UAE have already offered boosters using the UK and US vaccines to people who received Sinopharm's.

The research paper, originally published in Spanish but translated by Reuters, stated: 'The efficacy to prevent infection is not high.

'And this is something to consider once a high percentage of the population receives its two doses.'

It said this would be the 'moment when boosters can be considered to optimize the protection of frontline health workers'.

Dr Lely Solari, from Peru's health institute, told Reuters the 'vast majority' of positive tests included in the study were from symptomatic people, while some got tested if they suspected an infection.

She added: 'The most likely thing is you will indeed need a third dose at some point, the question is when is the best moment and with what type of vaccine.'

While the 50.4 per cent efficacy against infections was low, it was still accepted by the World Health Organization which requires a 50 per cent efficacy level.

The jab was originally found to be 78.1 per cent effective in clinical trials, according to the WHO.

The study examined how effective the jab was at preventing infections in healthcare staff between February and June, while the country was battling a second wave of infections

As it stands, 27.5 per cent of people in Peru have received a single dose of the vaccine, while 19.6 per cent are double-jabbed

The emergence of the Peru 'Lambada' variant in December, which has been found to render the jabs less effective, may have fueled the drop in efficacy.

It comes amid an ongoing debate about whether third booster jabs should be used in the UK, which has dished out the more effective AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna jabs.

Officials told the NHS to prepare to administer third doses from September to over-50s and healthcare workers alongside their annual flu jab.

But ministers are yet to make a formal decision on the jabs, with No10 waiting for the latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

Experts including Sir Andrew Pollard, one of the experts behind the AstraZeneca jab, said vaccines should be used to give first doses to people in other countries before being used as boosters in Britain.

Professor Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London and adviser on SAGE, said vaccines should be shared out equitably 'because the fewer millions of lungs you have virus replicating in, the better off we're all going to be.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Buried beneath the Jadar River valley in rural Serbia is a mineral which bears an uncanny resemblance to kryptonite, the fictional green crystal which saps Superman's powers.

More than a decade ago, a mineralogist at the Natural History Museum in London was asked by baffled Rio Tinto geologists to analyse this strange substance they had dug up a few years earlier near the Bosnian border.

Much to the delight of Rio's PR team, Dr Chris Stanley discovered the chemical compound – sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide – matched the description of kryptonite used by Superman's nemesis Lex Luthor in the 2006 film Superman Returns.

Going green: The chemical compound of Jadarite (right) matches the description of Kryptonite by Superman's nemesis Lex Luther

The big difference – apart from not being the stuff of comic book capers – is that this mineral is white and was contained in lumps of grey rock.

It is called jadarite and it looks set to be the next big money-spinner for Rio Tinto, which is racing to cash in on the global electric car revolution as internal combustion engines are replaced by batteries.

Rio discovered jadarite back in 2004 and has placed a £1.7billion bet on mining the little-known substance.

Jadarite, which Rio named after the Jadar valley in western Serbia, is a unique high-grade mineral compound of lithium and borates which has not been found anywhere else in the world.

Borates are crystallised salts that contain boron, which is used in fertilisers and heat resistant glass for smartphones, as well as materials for wind farms and solar panels.

Lithium, of course, is a key component in lithium-ion electric car batteries.

For the last few years Rio's scientists in a laboratory in the suburbs or Melbourne, Australia, have been trying to figure out how to process this compound to produce lithium and borates economically and at scale.

Having 'cracked the code', according to Rio, all that is now needed is a mine to dig it out of the ground.

The miner has already committed £1.7billion to a site near the Jadar river, which it says is set to become Europe's biggest supplier of lithium for at least the next 15 years.

It is currently waiting for approval from the Serbian government to start building, and is busy negotiating with a local farmer to buy a couple of hundred fields stretching across the 400-hectare site.

Jadarite - which mining giant Rio Tinto discovered in Siberia, bears many similarities to kryptonite, the fictional green crystal which saps Superman's powers

But if everything goes to plan it hopes to start construction next year, and production by 2026. Once operational, Rio believes it will be able to dig up 58,000 tons of jadarite a year, which will be enough for about 1m electric car batteries.

Overseeing the project from Brisbane is Sinead Kaufman, who hails from the home of Waterford Crystal in south-east Ireland and studied geology at Birmingham University before moving to Perth with Rio 16 years ago.

Kaufman, who runs Rio's minerals empire spanning diamonds to salt, is flying to Serbia on Saturday to see the site for the first time.

She said: 'Jadarite is amazing as it was actually found by Rio Tinto's geologists back in 2004. When they found it, they had no idea what it was as nobody had ever seen it before – it's a unique mineral.

'It looks like a grey rock with a bunch of white spots on it but each of those white spots is something quite special.'

Mining, oil and gas giants have all been busy burnishing their environmental credentials, amid growing pressure from politicians, environmental groups and big investors to tackle climate change and switch away from traditional fossil fuels to greener technologies.

While it is crucial they do their bit to hit net-zero carbon emissions targets, there is also a huge amount of money to be made.

Kaufman said demand for lithium is expected to grow by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent a year over the next decade, as diesel and petrol cars are phased out around the world.

Last month BHP signed a lucrative deal with Tesla boss Elon Musk (pictured) to supply nickel from its Kwinana refinery south of Perth, in Australia

'Lithium is really essential for the transition the world makes to a low carbon economy,' she said. 'It's something we know the world will need over the next few decades.

'You just can't produce the vision the world has for the electrification of cars if you don't have the material to make those batteries.'

But Rio is playing catch-up. Rival BHP has been mining another key component in lithium-ion electric car batteries – nickel – for years.

Last month BHP signed a lucrative deal with Elon Musk to supply nickel from its Kwinana refinery south of Perth, in Australia.

The silvery white metallic element is used to pack more energy into batteries and allows producers to reduce the use of cobalt, which is more expensive.

Nickel is also scarce and Musk has promised a 'giant contract for a long period of time' for a miner who can extract it while also causing minimal damage to the environment.

At the annual 'Diggers and Dealers' mining conference in Kalgoorlie, Australia, last week, BHP announced plans to build new nickel mines and wind farms in Western Australia as it tries to accelerate away from the fossil fuel sector.

But shortly before mining bosses showed off their green credentials there was a timely reminder that the battery technology remains in its infancy.

Firefighters had just spent the weekend trying to extinguish a blaze at Tesla's 'Big Battery', near Geelong in Victoria.

This is the largest lithium-ion battery in Australia and was built to provide electricity to the national grid. As it was far too dangerous to spray water on a 13-ton battery, the 150 firefighters had to let it burn for three days, sending big plumes of toxic smoke into the air.

Investigators will now try to determine precisely what caused the blaze.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@HSBC is dangling a £140 cash carrot in a bid to lure in new current account customers.

The banking giant is offering the cash bribe to those who switch to its Advance account using the Current Account Switch Service and taking with them at least two direct debits or standing orders.

New customers can also apply through MoneySuperMarket without the need to use CASS, although anyone tempted will need to act fast, as the offer ends on Thursday 19 August.

Cash carrot: HSBC's cash offer ends on 19 August 2021 and could be tempted for Tesco current account customers, who will see accounts shut soon

HSBC lost 26,743 current account switchers compared to the 23,892 it gained during the first three months of 2021, according to official figures.

One obstacle switchers need to overcome is that they will need to pay in at least £1,750 each month or £10,500 every six months to be eligible.

Michelle Stevens, deputy editor at personal finance comparison site Finder, said: 'HSBC's switching bonus is certainly generous by current standards, but you should read the fine print carefully before deciding whether it is the right deal for you.

'In order to get the bonus, you need to pay £1,750 into the account each month, which is a significant amount of money.

'If you don't think you would be able to do this then it would probably be better to wait for a more accessible deal to come along.'

Those who switch to HSBC will also be able to open a regular savings account in which they can stash away £25-£250 each month and earn 1 per cent interest.

Although 1 per cent interest is not bad given that the average easy-access savings rate is 0.18 per cent, according to Moneyfacts, it is still possible to to better.

Stevens added: 'Even if you paid in the maximum amount allowed of £250 per month (£3,000 per year), you would only earn interest of around £16.'

Should you apply?

More than 7.3 million people have now switched their bank account since 2013, according to figures from the CASS.

There are often benefits and incentives to be reaped from switching as banks compete for current account customers and £140 is certainly eye-catching.

With 213,000 Tesco bank customers needing to find a new bank by 30 November this might be particularly tempting to them.

Over the course of the past year, from June 2020 to June 2021, a total of 646,569 switches were processed by the Current Account Switch Service

But whilst cash incentives can be a big draw, it is important to consider the other factors that make switching worthwhile.

Customer service, overdraft limits, interest rates, cashback, saving perks and other niche benefits such as cinema tickets are all factors that count for something.

Starling Bank, for example, which made a net gain of 17,769 switchers between January and March, according to the CASS figures, doesn't offer incentives to switchers, instead relying on the strength of its customer service and its app.

Virgin Money, which secured a net gain of 17,495 switchers during that period is currently offering joiners a £150 Virgin Experience Days gift card allowing its customers to choose between thousands of experiences from spa days and short breaks to sky diving.

Customers worried about dipping into their overdraft each month might be more tempted by switching to First Direct and benefiting from having the first £250 of any overdraft borrowing being interest free.

Andrew Hagger, founder and director pf personal finance website, MoneyComms said: 'Don't simply switch for the cash bribe - ask yourself if the account really suits the way you run your day to day banking - if you often go into overdraft for example, then there are cheaper deals to consider.'

Lamborghini's iconic Countach - recently voted Britain's most popular poster car of all time - is making a comeback, the Italian marque has confirmed. And it looks set to be unveiled in a matter of days.

In a shock announcement, the iconic Italian sports car maker revealed via its social media channels that the Countach - first revealed in prototype form 50 years ago - will return in 2021.

Accompanying a teaser video to announce the news, the brand said: 'We make dreams come true. We did it with the classic Countach in the 1970s. And we're doing it again. The new Lamborghini Countach is coming.'

While details about the car and its unveiling are incredibly limited for now, the reborn Countach is expected to be debuted ahead of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California, which takes place on Sunday 15 August.

Countach is back! Lamborghini has revealed this teaser image of the reborn supercar, which looks set to be unveiled in full in the US next week

The original Countach debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971 as the LP500 concept, though it took another three years of development before the production version went on sale in 1974.

Still recognised as one of the greatest supercars of all time, the Countach's wedge-shaped design - penned by Marcello Gandini - and scissor doors were a huge departure from Lamborghini's original high-performance model, the Miura.

Earlier this year, returning chief executive Stefan Winkelmann promised two new models to feature the manufacturer's V12 engine before it embarked on electrifying its entire line-up, with the Countach set to be one of those cars to be among the last to get the wailing powerplant.

It's widely expected that it will share a powerplant with the hybrid Sián hypercar, using the 6.5-litre 12-cylinder motor and supercapacitor technology.

In a shock announcement on Monday night, Lamborghini confirmed the Countach nameplate will return in 2021 to mark the 50th anniversary of the original (pictured)

The return of the icon comes 50 years after the LP500 concept (pictured) was revealed at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show

The Countach went into production three years after the concept was showcased by Lamborghini. It was built from 1974 to 1990

Fewer than 2,000 examples of the original Countach were made despite it being in production for 16 years

It is unique from a traditional hybrid vehicle with a supplementary battery, being an electrical component that stores energy that can be used to boost both performance and efficiency.

With this being the case, be ready for the 2021 Countach to have somewhere in the region of 800PS (789 horsepower), accelerate from zero to 62mph in less than three seconds and have a top speed that nudges 220mph.

Further details about the car have been revealed on Instagram, having been leaked from the Lamborghini Unica app, which is exclusively reserved for customers who have at least one Lambo in their collection.

It's widely expected that the new Countach will share a powerplant with the hybrid Sián hypercar revealed in 2019. That means a 6.5-litre V12 with supercapacitor technology

The Contach is still recognised today as one of the greatest supercars of all time. Its looks were revolutionary when it went on sale in 1974

Reports suggest its full name will be Countach LPI 800-4.

'LPI' is short for 'Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido', which loosely translates to it having a longitudinally mounted engine positioned in the middle - though towards the rear - of the car with a hybrid system. The '800' figure denotes the power output and '4' refers to it being all-wheel drive.

In terms of the looks, one snap showing the car under cover suggests it will be a true homage to the straight-lined and supremely low design of the original.

The one picture of the new car under cover suggests the it will stay true to the first examples, meaning no enormous rear wing like the version to the far right

Scissor doors, which open upwards and forwards, are almost certainly set to return also, given that the Countach was the first model to debut the then bonkers feature in the seventies

More details of the new version of this Lamborghini classic have been leaked online, with the car's full name set to be Countach LPI 800-4

LPI' is short for 'Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido', which loosely translates to it having a longitudinally mounted engine positioned in the middle - though towards the rear - of the car with a hybrid system. Pictured, two original Countach examples

While the lone images gives little away, it does show a long body with short rear overhangs and a distinctive silouhette that has graced the walls of petrolheads through generations (read more about that further down this page).

It also suggests the new model will stay true to the first examples, meaning no enormous rear wing.

Scissor doors, which open upwards and forwards, are almost certainly set to return also, given that the Countach was the first model to debut the then bonkers feature.

And while the Countach was in production for 16 years with just shy of 2,000 examples built, the new version to mark its 50th anniversary is going to be sold in far limited numbers and is certainly not going to be a complete one-off vehicle.

The '800' figure in the new version's name is said to denote the power output (800PS) and '4' refers to it being all-wheel drive. Pictured, four original Countach examples

The 2021 tribute to this iconic classic is set to be showcased at the ultra-exclusive Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, which is part of the Monterey Car Week event in the US

Pebble Beach has been the destination for Lamborghini to unveil limited-edition hypercars in the past, so is the most likely destination for the covers to come off the new take on this 50-year-old icon

While fewer than 2,000 versions of the original Countach (pictured) were make, production of the 2021 car will be in much smaller volumes

More will be revealed soon, likely towards the end of Monterey Car Week in the US (5 August - 15 August).

The Munich motor show is due to take place next month but Lamborghini has used the exclusive Pebble Beach event to showcase its limited-run hypercars in the past.

As well as promising two new new V12 models, the Italian marque also confirmed earlier this year that it will have an entirely electrified car range by 2024.

The new Countach won't be a one-off special, though its limited production run will most certainly be offered to its most committed customers who already have one or two Lamborghinis in their collection

In its traser announcement, the brand said: 'We make dreams come true. We did it with the classic Countach in the 1970s. And we're doing it again. The new Lamborghini Countach is coming'

The Countach name was the first not to be associated with famous bulls and bullfighting. The name originated from the word 'contacc', an exclamation of astonishment in the Piedmontese language

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A record number of second-hand cars were purchased in the UK between April and June, according to new industry figures published this morning.

Demand for used motors is at an all-time high due to a combination of pent-up demand following the pandemic and - more notably - the significant drop in new car supplies as a result of the global semiconductor computer chip shortage.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the used car market grew 108.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2021, with more than 2.1 million motors changing hands.

However, those buying second-hand cars are paying a premium as a result of the recent huge surge in demand with average values up 14 per cent year-on-year, according to Auto Trader.

Used car sales at record levels: The bottleneck in deliveries of new models caused by the global computer chip shortage has seen demand for second-hand vehicles surge in the second quarter of 2021

People buying used VWs, like the popular Golf hatchback pictured, face paying more money than a year ago with a 7.7% average price increase from the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter

Average prices of Smart's diminutive city cars have risen by around £900 in the last three months

Those looking for more luxury have seen used prices of a Mercedes Benz increase by more than 6% on average in the last three months alone

Industry data shows that a total of 2,167,504 used cars were bought in the months of April, May and June - up 6.6 per cent on 2019 pre-pandemic levels and the best second quarter performance on record.

In fact, bosses confirmed it was the second highest quarterly performance for used car sales ever, falling just 1,095 transactions shy of the 2020 third quarter high of 2,168,599, which was artificially inflated by the fact showrooms had been forced to close for much of the first half of that year due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The SMMT said the spike in sales was due to a combination of the country’s gradual emergence from lockdown and stock shortages in the new car market.

Latest registrations statistics published a week ago show that new motor sales plunged to their lowest July level since 1998, with deliveries bottlenecked by the global chip shortage.

This has forced many consumers to instead turn to used models to replace their existing vehicles, with April sales alone up 307.4 per cent on 2020 (and 5 per cent up on 2019) with 724,743 transactions in the month.

May and June also posted sales increases of 9.9 per cent and 4.6 per cent on pre-pandemic levels respectively, which were the best performances for both months ever seen.

It means that used car transactions for the first half of 2021 are up by a third (33.3 per cent) year-on-year to 3,855,259 units.

However, the lockdown during the first three months means second-hand sales are still 4.9 per cent down on half-year 2019 levels.

Considering a used Volvo? Experts suggest you'll have to pay 6.1% more on average today than you did in January, February and March this year

Even bargain hunters seeking a budged Dacia have seen the average price increase from £9,404.02 to £9,917.30 between Q1 and Q2 this year

With increased demand comes higher prices

With second-hand vehicle interest and sales at near record levels, so are prices of used motors.

With buyers growing increasingly frustrated with long waiting times and delivery delays for new models, many have turned their attention to used cars.

Ian Plummer, commercial director, Auto Trader, says the used car market is benefitting from a ‘multitude of tailwinds’ and, as a result, has revised predictions for used car sales in 2021, estimating eight million will change hands this year.

'Coupled with used car supply challenges, this demand has sent used prices rocketing, up from an already significant 7.1 per cent year-on-year increase in April to 11.1 per cent in June. This steep trajectory has continued, and as of July, prices are tracking at over 14 per cent,' he explained.

'With none of these consumer or economic factors showing any sign of easing, we’ve revised our 2021 forecast.

'We predict circa eight million used cars will be sold this year, which is considerably more robust than those made by other commentators, but we believe more accurately reflect the exceptional health of the market.'

Online automotive marketplace Heycar says it has seen the average price of a used VW rise by 8% in just one month as more drivers turn to the second-hand market

CAR BRANDS THAT ROSE IN VALUE MOST ON AVERAGE FROM Q1-Q2 2021 2021-Q1 2021-Q2 2021-Q2 MAKE Avg Price Avg Price % change Volkswagen £19,525.15 £21,032.15 7.7% Smart £10,125.51 £10,807.87 6.7% Mercedes-Benz £27,120.33 £28,861.03 6.4% Volvo £28,056.35 £29,754.21 6.1% Dacia £9,404.02 £9,917.30 5.5% SEAT £15,590.73 £16,386.99 5.1% Jaguar £33,563.86 £35,106.14 4.6% Audi £25,726.82 £26,870.24 4.4% Toyota £15,245.38 £15,911.24 4.4% Nissan £14,309.58 £14,838.80 3.7% Source: Heycar

Rival online car sales site heycar claims it has tracked average values of Volkswagens sold via its website increasing most between Q1 and Q2 as more buyers switch attention to the used market.

Karen Hilton, chief commercial officer said she has not been surprised to see that more people are keen to cash in on this spell of increased buying power.

'At heycar, we have seen a surge in part exchanges - jumping from around five per cent of our activity to 40 per cent in the space of a fortnight, she said.

'Motorists are clearly trading up, too - our dealer partners are telling us that people who do part exchange spend an extra £13,000 on their next car, on average.

'In this general period of market strength, certain manufacturers are more in demand. So, between Q1 and Q2, we have seen Ford models rise by 3.6 per cent, Nissans by 3.7 per cent and Volkswagens by 7.7 per cent.'

Online used car marketplace BuyaCar also recently claimed it had seen values 'shoot up to an unprecedented level' it calls 'new record prices' in recent weeks, with evidence of drivers paying more on average than ever before to secure a second-hand motor.

This increasingly strangled supply of new cars has seen the average price of a used models sold on its website rise from £13,108 in January to an all-time high of £15,399 in May - with prices continue to rise since.

It also claims that the average price of its top five best-selling cars broke the £17,000 barrier for the first time since the website launched in 2002.

SMMT stats show there's been an increase in sales of older used cars with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold in April to June being three years or under, the lowest on record

Commenting on the spike in second-hand motor demand, Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said, 'This is welcome news for the used car market as transactions rebounded following nationwide lockdowns which closed retailers.

'More motorists are turning to used cars as supply shortages continue to affect the new car market, and the increased need for personal mobility with people remaining wary of public transport as they return to work.

'A buoyant used car market is necessary to maintain strong residual values which, in turn, supports new car transactions.

'We now need to see a similar rebound in new car sales to accelerate the fleet renewal necessary to deliver immediate and continuous improvements in air quality and carbon emissions.'

Demand for used battery electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicles tripled in the second quarter to 10,903 and 16,202 - up 353.9 per cent and 349.8 per cent respectively.

However, these plug-in cars represent just 1.3 per cent of all second-hand vehicle transactions as older versions of electrified vehicles are slowly entering the used market.

Petrol and diesel powertrains, meanwhile, made up 96.4 per cent of the quarter’s used car market at 2,090,396 units.

In addition, increased demand overall has led to an increase in sales of older used cars with only 12.7 per cent of all vehicles sold being three years or under, the lowest on record.

Ford's Fiesta was the most-bought used car in the second quarter of 2021, while black was the most popular vehicle colour to change hands.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tens of thousands of video clips and images have been sent to police showing motorists driving carelessly, dangerously and against the law in the last three years, latest figures show.

Since the National Dash Cam Safety Portal was created in summer 2018, a total of 68,279 pieces of footage and photos have been uploaded as part of 32,905 unique public submissions by drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians who have informed on road users putting others at risk.

It says 2021 has been the busiest so far with 19,565 videos uploaded to the platform in the first half of the year and a 341 per cent increase on average in the months of April to June.

Law Breakers: The National Dash Cam Safety Portal has in 3 years received 68,279 pieces of footage and photos since its inception in the summer of 2018

The NDCSP is now in its third year of operation with 37 of the 45 UK police forces currently signed up to use it - and more in talks to join.

The database - created by dashcam manufacturer Nextbase and security software specialist, Egress - provides a simple online portal for any member of the public to send images and videos of other drivers being reckless at the wheel.

With police numbers being cut in the last decade, the portal has provided a simple way for people to submit evidence to the police, which is then reviewed by officers to deem if the footage shows actions that are offence worthy.

The surge in use of dashcams, with motorists and cyclists using cameras for insurance and claims purposes, and smartphones means people have been capturing clips of poor driving in increasing numbers.

Motoring groups have previously said that it has become a 'sad state of affairs' that dwindling police numbers has meant that 'dash cam vigilantes' are now required to enforce the nation's road safety.

Any images and video taken by the public can be sent to police via the portal and can be used to prosecute dangerous drivers in the same way speed camera clips are used as the sole evidence needed to punish limit-breaking motorists.

Some 19,565 videos have been uploaded to the platform in the first half of the year and a 341% increase on average in the months of April to June

Each video requires a short description of the event captured, additional photos and a supporting online questionnaire, which takes around 15 minutes to complete in total.

This can be used as an eye-witness statement if police proceed with punishing a driver caught on camera.

Nextbase says the the database has saved police a collective 263,240 hours - the equivalent of over 29 years of officers' time - in the three years it has been in use.

It says 2021 has so far proven to be the system’s busiest time yet.

As lockdown restrictions began to ease in April, with beer gardens opening and the number of people beginning to go on staycations across the country increased, some 19,565 submissions have been made so far this year.

In the months of April to June, the portal saw 5,457 road traffic offences punished - which is more than double the three-month average since the portal’s inception.

These penalties can range from court cases to awareness courses, or fixed penalty notices to warning letters.

All public-generated video footage can be used to target a multitude of offences including dangerous driving, driving without due care and attention, contravening solid white lines, mobile phone use, improper control of vehicle and contravening red traffic lights.

Fewer than one in five of the 33,000 cases sent to police have resulted in no further action, records show. That means around 80% of submissions have sparked court cases, awareness courses, fixed penalty notices or warning letters

According to latest records, fewer than one in five of the near-33,000 cases uploaded by the public have resulted in no further action by police.

Nextbase says this has 'demonstrated the success of the platform in identifying the most severe of incidents and linking motorists with police in a bid to crack down on this behaviour'.

Bryn Brooker, head of road safety at the dashcam maker, said, 'These stats show that the portal is needed now more than ever and I would like to remind the public of the fact that Dash Cam technology can help other road users, as well as you and your passengers.

'If we all work together, with the police, to continue to identify the worst of the worst – those dangerous drivers that, put simply, should not be allowed behind the wheel – then we will continue to see motorists from across the country interacting with the Portal.

'This is why it was built, to make the roads of this country safer for those of us that are just trying to get from A to B and go about our daily routines.

'We have watched this platform grow from both a public and police perspective and are hugely encouraged by its continued appeal.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The stock market has staged a strong recovery from its March lows, but there are likely to be more tough days ahead.

This has been highlighted by falls after the UK's FTSE 100 broke back above the 6,000 mark briefly.

In the US, the bounce-back has been led by strong sentiment around the tech giants, particularly the FAANGs of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.

In the UK, big name companies have led the way, with housebuilders, some retailers and even cruise firm Carnival enjoying a rebound.

But which are the sectors and companies that can navigate their way through the difficult days as the world tries to get back on its feet after the coronavirus crisis and lockdowns?

Will the same companies that have gained in the past month continue to do well?

And is this the start of recovery or is the market due another fall, as the bad coporate news really starts to hit?

Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter discuss which firms could do well - and those that might be able to hold onto some or all of their prized dividends.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As more people look to book holidays and head abroad in the coming months, a list of the best firms to travel with has been compiled by Which?

Exodus, Explore and Discover Egypt were the only three firms given the top rating of green+ as they were the only ones able to guarantee refunds in the event a customer was told to self-isolate prior to travel, according to its new holiday checker tool.

The consumer group compared the booking policies of more than 80 of the UK's package holiday providers and rated each as red, amber, green or green+, depending on how they perform against criteria set by experts.

Aside from the three 'best' travel firms, British Airways Holidays, First Choice, Hays Travel, Jet2 Holidays, Trailfinders and Tui were put in Which?'s green list, based on their refund policies.

Only three companies were found to have the highest rating of Green+ on Which?'s new tool

The tool has been created in response to the travel industry's reaction to the coronavirus pandemic.

Holidaymakers are likely to have long memories after last year with thousands complaining their provider was taking months to refund them - or they couldn't get through to their travel firm at all.

As a result, the tool looks to help point customers in the direction of the companies with the best flexible booking options so they can book with greater confidence and know they're less likely to be left out of pocket should something go wrong.

The research considered each firms policies on coronavirus-related disruption.

This included whether firms would refund customers in the event of a lockdown, if FCDO advice changes, if the customer is told to self-isolate before travelling and if customers are forced to quarantine in a hotel on their return.

Following a rise in concerns about people being contacted by NHS Test and Trace before they are due to travel, the experts also asked companies if they would provide full refunds in the event someone is told to self-isolate.

Only three firms including Exodus, Explore and Discover Egypt guaranteed refunds in this situation, as well as every other situation put to them by Which? and were rated green+ as a result.

Meanwhile, companies that committed to offering refunds in most scenarios put to them by Which? include British Airways Holidays, First Choice, Hays Travel, Jet2 Holidays, Trailfinders and Tui which were rated green.

This will likely provide some reassurance to customers who have already booked with these firms as well as encouraging others to book with them in the future.

Meanwhile, there were several companies placed on the red list with holidaymakers advised not to book with these providers.

Lastminute.com, Love Holidays, On the Beach and Teletext were all on the list after they were found to be putting customers at risk of being out of pocket if they are unable to travel as planned.

The research found these firms faced many shortcomings with their booking terms and commitments including not refunding customers in the event of coronavirus-related disruption with a lack of transparency about their policies.

In response, an On the Beach spokesperson said: 'We know it's difficult to make a decision about going on holiday at the moment – it's part of the reason that we stopped taking new bookings for this summer back in May and we continue to provide customers with as much flexibility as possible.

'If the FCDO advises against travel to a destination, our customers can change their holiday destination or dates free of charge, and we will waive any of our admin fees.

'If they wish to cancel their holiday, we will fully refund hotel and transfer costs, and our regulated, ring-fenced trust account means that we are able to do this quickly and always in cash rather than credit notes or vouchers.

'Prior to the pandemic, when the FCDO advised against non-essential travel to a destination, this triggered the closure of airspace and the cancellation of all non-essential flights.

'During the pandemic this has often not been the case, with airlines continuing to fly to affected destinations and many consumers still wanting to go on the holiday they have booked.

'Our holidays include flights from multiple third party airlines and the decision on whether to operate those flights lies with each airline. If the airline cancels the flight, then we will, of course, pass the refund straight on to our customers in full.

'Wherever customers are entitled to cancel and receive a full refund under the Package Travel Regulations then we will refund customers in full and in cash.'

A number of holiday providers were put on the Red list including Lastminute.com & Teletext

It added that if a customer wishes to cancel their holiday due to FCDO advice but the flight operates as planned, the airline retains the monies paid for the flight and in those instances this leaves it unable to pass a refund onto its customers.

However, Lastminute.com, Love Holidays and Teletext did not provide comment.

Companies that did not provide clear information on their booking policies were also rated as red for a lack of transparency.

While red companies' policies were not necessarily in breach of consumer law, some have faced investigations from the Competition and Markets Authority in the past year over failure to refund their customers including Love Holidays and Teletext.

Therefore, Which? is advising consumers against booking with a red company and to check before they book to ensure their holiday provider offers a good flexible booking policy.

Companies' ratings will be regularly evaluated to keep up to date with any changes to their policies as well as any changes to rules around international travel.

However, the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO) has hit back at Which? over the new tool claiming it is unfair to list firms as Red when the travel industry has been one of the worst hit.

Chris Rowles, Chairman of AITO, said: 'In a pandemic when no travel company has been able to trade for 17 months and all have had to dig deep into their own pockets to refund customers as quickly as they could, one expects better of our so-called consumer champion, Which?

'It may have escaped the attention of the team at Which? that, during the pandemic, travel companies have earnt no income whatsoever – they are paid only when clients depart on holiday, and our Government has not permitted any outbound travel from the UK except, mostly, for truck drivers.

'This is clearly not normal business practice and one would hope that those who run Which? might perhaps have been a tad more understanding than normal in recognition of these key facts and the struggle to survive that the travel industry has faced over the past year and a half.'

Several holiday firms have been ordered to refund customers by the CMA after taking too long

It is perhaps unsurprising that some of the firms are in the red list with This is Money previously reporting that Teletext could face legal action after failing to return more than £7million in refunds to customers.

The CMA said in May that the holiday firm had failed to address complaints from hundreds of customers who had not received refunds on cancelled trips within 14 days as required by law.

In response, hundreds of customers told us they had been waiting months, if not over a year, for a refund from the firm.

Many were waiting for thousands of pounds back but found it impossible to get through to the company by either phone or email.

Love Holidays was also investigated by the CMA in December of last year and was forced to refund 44,000 customers more than £18million for trips cancelled during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Lastminute.com also agreed to pay over £7million in refunds to customers for cancelled holidays in the same month after many customers complained they had to wait longer than the legal requirement to be compensated within a fortnight of cancellation.

Rory Boland, editor of Which? travel, said: 'Between changing travel restrictions, both in the UK and abroad, and the ongoing risk of being told to self-isolate, booking a foreign trip still comes with some uncertainty and things can go wrong if you've chosen the wrong provider.

'The best companies won't leave you high and dry though, so it's vital to do your research before booking.

'The difference between choosing a red company over a green company could be losing the entire cost of your holiday if circumstances change and you have to amend or cancel your plans.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2018, my 80-year-old neighbour asked me to look at her utilities and telephone bills.

I discovered BT was charging her £30 per month for broadband. She has never owned a computer, tablet or iPhone. I contacted BT and eventually it stopped this charge.

Then, in March 2020, it started charging for broadband again. BT insists she ordered broadband that month. It says it's a fixed contract and she must continue paying until March 2022.

D. H., Letchworth, Herts.

One reader discovered their neighbour was being charged by BT for broadband even though she had never owned a computer, tablet or iPhone

Tony Hazell replies: BT assures me she has been using broadband, likely without realising it. I suspect others are in a similar situation.

She uses an old BT TV box to watch free channels, and views programmes that have already been shown via catch-up services.

She may not even know she is watching catch-up TV, as some TVs allow you to scroll backwards through the guide and click on the programme you want to watch.

Catch-up viewing can only be done via broadband. You were both surprised, as she tells you that when she clicks on certain channels she gets a message about upgrading her subscription. But this is another issue.

These channels will be part of BT's subscription packages. It is possible to hide them to avoid this irritation.

BT has agreed to put her on to a special deal. She will pay just £20.99 per month until March 2022, rather than £30.12.

Missing parcels with sentimental goods

My daughter split up with her long-term partner who, unknown to me, had been mentally abusive. She escaped to a friend's house with a few belongings.

When she returned with friends to get more items, her ex was obstructive, so she just grabbed what she could.

She later moved to a flat and arranged to have her favourite dresses, plus a quilt I'd made for her birthday four years previously, sent there via Parcelforce. But Parcelforce delivered the parcels to someone else.

It says that it checked the other address but did not get any reply. The firm won't release the name and address of the recipient due to confidentiality issues, so we can't investigate ourselves. We are heartbroken.

Name and address supplied.

Parcelforce lost one reader's treasured items and offered £500 compensation in return

Tony Hazell replies: Parcelforce says it has done all it can to locate the items but they have not been returned. The firm told you they had been 'disposed of', which sounds to me as if the recipient chose to sell them.

I asked Parcelforce why it had not involved the police when the recipient could or would not return the items. The firm refused to answer this and other questions.

You have been paid £500 compensation, but that is poor recompense for the loss of these items of sentimental value.

A spokesman said: 'We've apologised for any upset this has caused. We realise we cannot compensate for the sentimental value of these items, but we are giving a payment as a gesture of goodwill, as well as some flowers, in an effort to make amends.'

It feels as though Parcelforce decided it was simpler to write a cheque than to put extra effort into finding your lost treasures.

STRAIGHT TO THE POINT My Vodafone 'Pay as you go 1' tariff should provide unlimited minutes, texts and up to 50MB of data for 24 hours for £1 a day. But, after leaving my phone switched off for weeks, I was charged £12 for three days of light use. S. L., Atherstone, Warwicks. Tony Hazell replies: A Vodafone spokesman tried to reach you but hasn't heard back. Their best guess is that when you turned your phone back on, a large number of apps refreshed, taking you over the 50MB limit and resulting in extra charges. I paid £427 for tickets to Ladies Day at Aintree Race Course in April 2020. When it was cancelled due to Covid, I transferred tickets to the 2021 event but it was axed again.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The savings from the stamp duty holiday have been 'dwarfed by the impact of recent house price spikes', new data from Nationwide reveals.

The price of an average home increased by around £24,500 between July 2020 the end of June this year, while the stamp duty saving on that property for a home mover in England was around £1,900, Nationwide said.

For a £500,000 property that increased at the average rate over the same period, the comparable house price increase was roughly £57,000 against a stamp duty saving of £15,000.

Impact: The ‘savings’ from the stamp duty holiday have been dwarfed by the impact of recent house price spikes, Nationwide said

Prices: A chart showing what's been happening to house prices since June 2011

Month-on-month, house prices fell by 0.5 per cent in July, against a 0.7 per cent rise in June, according to Nationwide. The dip marked the first time prices have dropped since March and signify the biggest decline in prices since June 2020.

On an annual basis, average property prices jumped 10.5 per cent, against a 13.4 per cent rise in the year to June, which marked the highest jump for 13 years.

The average cost of a home now stands at £244,229, while in June it stood at £245,432, Nationwide said.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a less marked cooling of the market, predicting prices would rise by 0.6 per cent from June and by 12.1 per cent on an annual basis.

The end of the full temporary tax holiday saw the threshold cut from £500,000 to £250,000 as of 30 June and it is set to revert back to £125,000 on 30 September.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: 'This provided a strong incentive to complete house purchases before the end of June, especially for higher priced properties.

'For those purchasing a property above £250,000, the maximum stamp duty saving reduced from £15,000 to £2,500 after the end of June.'

Buyers had rushed to complete deals before the deadline, with the number of housing market transactions soaring to a record high of almost 200,000 in June, which is around twice the typical monthly number before the pandemic.

Mr Gardner, said: 'The modest fall-back in July was unsurprising given the significant gains recorded in recent months.

'Indeed, house prices increased by an average of 1.6% a month over the April to June period - more than six times the average monthly gain recorded in the five years before the pandemic.

'The tapering of stamp duty relief in England is also likely to have taken some of the heat out of the market.'

Nationwide said the tax relief was not the only factor driving the market higher, with shifting demands due to the pandemic also prompting Britons to move.

The number of transactions involving properties snapped up for £500,000 or more increased by 37 per cent over the year to March, compared to a rise of 2 per cent for all properties.

As a result, between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of this year, the share of transactions involving a property valued at £500,000 or above has increased from 12 per cent to 18 per cent.

Homeworking and lockdowns have also seen buyers look for larger, out-of-town properties with more outdoor space.

Over the past six months, the proportion of sales involving detached and semi-detached properties has increased, while the proportion involving flats has dropped 'significantly', according to Nationwide.

It believes underlying demand will remain 'solid' as interest rates remain at rock bottom and consumer confidence returns thanks to easing restrictions, adding to a lack of properties on the market.

But rising unemployment as the furlough and other government support schemes wind down may impact demand at the turn of the year, according to experts.

Mr Gardner said: 'Activity will almost inevitably soften for a period after the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of September, given the incentive for people to bring forward their purchases to avoid the additional tax.

'Nevertheless, underlying demand is likely to soften around the turn of the year if unemployment rises, as most analysts expect, as government support schemes wind down.

'But even this is far from assured. Even if the labour market does weaken, there is also scope for shifts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic to continue to support activity for some time yet.'

Transactions: Transaction levels spiked as people rushed to buy ahead of the stamp duty holiday

Affordable? A chart showing UK house price to earnings ratio, according to Nationwide

Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, added: 'Although the balance of power may be starting to switch from sellers to buyers, record-low mortgage rates, stock shortages and hopefully continuing easing of lockdown restrictions mean there's unlikely to be a major shift in prices or transaction numbers any time soon.'

Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: 'The stamp duty holiday has not been the only factor supporting house prices.

'Government support to household incomes and ultra-low mortgage rates have also played a role, factors which will persist at least in the short term.

'And the pandemic has had potentially long-lasting effects on property preferences, not least raising demand for larger homes in a world of more home working. Combined with fuel for property deposits provided by the substantial savings accumulated by households during lockdowns, the ingredients are in place to maintain house prices at current, elevated, levels.

'There are some headwinds in addition to the end of the stamp duty holiday. On measures such as the ratio of house prices to household incomes, affordability looks increasingly stretched.

'And despite a recovering economy, higher inflation and the prospect of some increase in unemployment when the furlough scheme ends means the outlook for household income growth is not all positive. But, the odds of a significant correction in house prices anytime soon looks small.'

On Tuesday, Zoopla published its latest house price index, revealing that average property prices across Britain are now 30 per cent higher than they were at the peak of the market in 2007, before the global financial crash.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Virgin Media O2 has launched the first ever National Databank, providing free mobile data to those in need.

It is hoped the Databank could help some of the seven million people across the UK who are unable to access mobile data or broadband at home.

Access to the internet is becoming increasingly important as many are still working and studying from home.

The project has been created by Virgin Media O2, but the free data will be distributed by the charity Good Things Foundation, through its network of 5,000 community organisations.

Virgin Media O2 has launched a National Databank, giving free mobile data to those in need

It will launch with 7.5million GB of O2 mobile data, to help over 200,000 people get connected by the end of 2023.

The National Databank, which will be open to all mobile operators, will provide free data for community groups to distribute across the UK, including the most digitally deprived areas.

It will provide a central hub where community groups can access free 'data voucher codes' and Sim cards for anyone who needs them.

Those accessing free data will also be offered additional support, including digital skills training and signposting to other essential services.

Virgin Media O2 said it would donate £12.5million worth of O2 connectivity – equivalent to 7.5million GB of data - to the National Databank by the end of 2023.

This is enough to provide 319million hours of internet use to over 200,000 people in need, nationwide.

The network has also donated £500,000 to Good Things Foundation to cover the operational costs of running the Databank.

Ahead of a nationwide rollout in November, an initial three-month pilot with 10 community organisations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is now underway.

The pilot will help test and improve the online platform built by Virgin Media O2's innovation team, The Lab.

As a growing number of households struggle to afford data, Virgin Media O2 and Good Things Foundation called on other mobile networks to join the National Databank.

It said this would help grow the platform as a long-term, sustainable solution to tackle data poverty, and that by working together, the industry had the power to provide connectivity to millions of digitally excluded people across the UK.

Virgin Media O2 will donate £12.5million worth of O2 connectivity to the National Databank

Lutz Schüler, chief executive officer at Virgin Media O2, said: 'The pandemic has escalated the UK's data poverty crisis like never before – and with many millions of people facing digital exclusion, now is the time to come together and close the gap on digital inequality.

'Our industry has done remarkable things in recent months to keep customers connected when they needed it most, but it can't stop there.

'By establishing the first ever National Databank with Good Things Foundation, coupled with a £12.5million data pledge, we want to build a lasting legacy from the pandemic. We're now asking our colleagues in the mobile industry to join us and help end data poverty for good.'

Matt Warman, the Government's digital infrastructure minister, added: 'I welcome Virgin Media O2's significant investment in the National Databank.

'This is a perfect example of industry innovation making a huge difference to people's lives, and will mean more practical help for those on low incomes to get online and access the endless benefits of digital connectivity.'

After the pilot scheme is over, those looking to apply will be able to find their nearest participating centre online.

It is expected that the National Databank will start operating nationwide from November 2021.

Virgin Media and O2's £31billion merger launched on 1 June, with the newly-formed firm promising to help power the nation's recovery after coronavirus.

The business is now one of the UK's largest, with 47million connections across broadband, mobile, TV and home phone.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Months of cinema closures meant Cineworld attracted far fewer moviegoers and posted immense losses in the first half of the year.

Capacity limits and a dearth of major films caused by distributors delaying their release meant the UK-based group that operates here and in the US saw ticket sales collapse and it record $515.2million in losses during the period.

Though it raised ticket prices and customers spent more money on average when visiting cinemas, the company, which reports in US dollars despite its UK stock market listing, still saw revenues decline by more than half to $292.8million.

But shares rose today as investors looked to a brighter future without lockdowns and were buoyed by its suggestion that it may split off all or part of its US arm and raise cash with a separate stock market listing for it.

Shush!: A Quiet Place: Part II starring Emily Blunt (right) was one of the most popular movies among the much smaller group of visitors to Cineworld outlets in the first half of the year

In the UK, where the company's cinemas were shut from January to mid-May, only 2.6 million people watched a film in one of Cineworld's establishments, about 7 million fewer than last year.

Its much larger US-based division and trade throughout the rest of the world displayed similar falls in attendance and box office receipts. In total, the firm's admissions plummeted by 70 per cent and retail revenue fell by over £120million.

Yet despite the lack of moviegoers, crowds flocked in big numbers to watch the horror movie A Quiet Place: Part II, Fast and Furious 9, monster film Godzilla vs. Kong, while children's movie Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway was popular in the UK.

Cineworld's losses were around two-thirds lower than the same time last year the coronavirus pandemic brought the motion picture industry to a virtual halt. Shares closed trading 3.9 per cent higher at 63.7p on Thursday.

Now that most capacity restrictions have been lifted, the FTSE 250 business also noted that demand is steadily reviving and is expecting several upcoming releases to provide a boost.

These include the James Bond film No Time to Die, four Marvel Studios productions including Eternals and Spider-Man: No Way Home, the long-awaited Top Gun sequel, and the fourth film of the Matrix franchise.

Coming back: Cineworld's losses were around two-thirds lower than the same time last year when the coronavirus pandemic brought the motion picture industry to a virtual halt

He added: 'I am confident that the business is in a strong position to execute its strategy and deliver a return to growth as we recover from the pandemic and capitalise on the forthcoming strong film slate alongside clear pent-up consumer demand.'

The group additionally announced today that it was pondering a possible listing on the US stock market to try and raise cash.

Cineworld said it might list its whole business or partially spin off its US-based Regal arm in the United States to access the country's heavily liquid capital markets.

Big show: AMC's share price has grown by over 1,500 per cent since the start of 2020

Cineworld is the world's second-largest cinema chain behind AMC Entertainment, which has been one of the most heavily-traded 'meme stocks' this year following a coordinated effort by traders on Reddit to hurt short sellers.

AMC’s share price has grown by over 1,500 per cent since the start of 2020, and it has taken advantage of this frantic market upswing to initiate numerous equity fundraisings that have helped it raise money and stave off bankruptcy.

Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency expert Begbies Traynor, said continued restrictions and a lack of willingness on the part of cinemagoers means that cinemas are lagging behind in the economic recovery and will have to start thinking of different ways to recover.

She added: 'Recently, it has felt as if Cineworld, and others in the sector, were pinning their hopes too tightly to the release of summer blockbuster films, but these are not for everyone.

'The pandemic has stalled the pipeline of many lower-budget films creating a dearth of range. Major blockbusters are not going to lure everyone; there is a huge customer base of dedicated regular filmgoers that flock to the cinema for the very films that have stalled in production at the moment.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Those with energy efficient homes could soon borrow up to £12,000 more on their mortgage with one lender - as data reveals the number of green mortgages available has increased five-fold since April.

Data provided by broker Property Master for This is Money shows that the number of green mortgages, across both mainstream residential and buy-to-let, has increased from just 78 products in April to 400 now.

Green mortgages reward borrowers for having a good Energy Performance Certificate rating by lending them more money based on their income, cutting fees or giving them a better interest rate.

Go green: Green mortgages reward those whose homes are energy-efficient

In the latest move to incentivise buying greener homes or retro-fitting existing ones with green improvements, Monmouthshire Building Society is in the process of 'recalibrating' its affordability calculator so that those with EPC A or B rated homes can borrow more than those rated D, E, F or G.

The average EPC rating for homes on its books is a D.

Monmouthshire is currently testing out the new concept on two new-build sites in Wales, and told This is Money that those in the top two bands could borrow up to £12,000 more compared to those in more poorly-performing properties.

Most lenders use Government data on average energy bills to factor in a home's running costs, but this generic data doesn't always accurately reflect the real running costs of a home.

Owning a more efficient home costs less, and in theory leaves the owner-occupier with more disposable income which could be used on a higher mortgage repayment.

Some mortgage experts say this kind of approach to lending is long overdue.

'From a borrowing point of view, it is only right that a client who is buying a property that is going to cost them less to run each month should be rewarded when assessing affordability,' says Matt Coulson, director at broker Heron Financial.

'If they don't need to set aside as much of their earnings to pay utility bills, they should have more left for their repayments.'

Adaptations such as solar panels can improve the chance of getting an Energy Performance Certificate rating of C or above and potentially qualifying for a green mortgage

Most existing green mortgages require the borrower to find and apply for a specific 'green' product.

If Monmouthshire does roll out the new calculator across all its lending, it could be the first to factor in a low EPC rating no matter which product the customer has chosen.

Monmouthshire made the decision after being involved with Valuations And Lending Underwriting Energy Reduction or 'Valuer;' a group of property organisations including Rightmove and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors which are researching ways to link energy efficiency with mortgage lending.

Graham Sumsion, who is the lending operations manager at Monmouthshire Building Society, says: 'The problem we are coming up against is that energy-efficient new-build homes cost more to build, and therefore sell for more, which reduces the market for them as people can't get a big enough mortgage.

'But lenders could consider lending more against these homes, because the buyers' bills will be low.'

Property Master's data shows that the 400 green products are being offered by 19 lenders, taking in the majority of the high-street names.

However, their motives for doing so are not entirely altruistic, as policy changes are on the horizon which will put both individuals and businesses under pressure to lower their environmental impact.

Angus Stewart, chief executive of Property Master, says: 'Basically, what we are seeing here is lenders getting into position to meet the requirements of the Government's net zero policy, which involves a commitment for all domestic properties to achieve an EPC of a C or above by 2035.

'As part of this, mortgage lenders are being expected to ensure by the end of 2030 the average energy performance level of their domestic portfolios is at least EPC C.'

Is it enough to make homeowners go green?

Under pressure to balance their books, more lenders are likely to offer incentives to bring on board those with good EPC ratings.

That is good news for those that already own energy-efficient properties.

Borrowers are unlikely to choose 'green' properties just because they may access a slightly lower interest rate Mortgage broker Gerard Boon

But with the price of eco-friendly new builds, and the cost of retrofitting things like air source heat pumps, still very high, some experts struggle to believe that a slightly bigger mortgage or a marginally better interest rate will be enough to persuade homeowners to buy a greener home or take on significant renovations.

'I do not expect green mortgages and the incentives around them to have a significant impact on demand [for eco-friendly homes,' says Gerard Boon, mortgage broker at Boon Brokers.

'Borrowers are unlikely to choose 'green' properties just because they may access a slightly lower interest rate or a slightly higher affordability.'

However, it may have more of an impact when combined with other motivating factors such as cheaper bills and having no need for renovations.

What about those who can't afford to upgrade their home?

Ultimately, the supply of green homes is still quite limited, and there are concerns that those in older properties will be unfairly penalised if lenders continue to offer preferential treatment.

Katie Brain, mortgage expert at Defaqto, says: 'On the one hand this could mean that borrowers purchasing a low-energy home are able to borrow more, which may be attractive when property prices are high.

'But what about those who cannot afford the price of newer, lower energy properties? This could be seen to be penalising people.'

Incentives aside, the cost of purchasing a low-energy home will be too much for some. Prices are often higher than older properties and retrofitting can also be expensive

Monmouth says it is keen to help people with the cost of retrofitting their properties, by providing further advance loans secured on their homes at a favourable rate.

'We are especially keen to support our members buying homes on net-zero sites, but we also want to help existing homeowners to improve their properties,' says Sumsion.

'As part of the pilot we have gone out and looked at customers' homes and created a pathway for them to get their home to zero carbon.'

While this may help some people on their way to being more energy efficient, taking out a loan is still a big ask when the exact cost benefits are unclear.

Although it is growing quickly, the green mortgage sector is still in its infancy, and little information is available so far on the public's appetite for such products.

There may be a big push by the banks, but whether the average homeowner will bite remains to be seen.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently called for Britain's pension funds to put their weight behind the UK economy by investing more of their money in big infrastructure projects.

Their call to infrastructure arms was made earlier this month in a letter to investment managers. 'It's time we recognised the quality that other countries see in the UK,' they said, 'and back ourselves by investing more money into the companies and infrastructure that will drive growth and prosperity across our country.'

A number of investment managers – including 3i, HICL and GCP – already run stock market listed funds that invest in infrastructure projects.

For example, the £3.3billion HICL Infrastructure fund, a component of the FTSE250 Index, generates a steady stream of income for shareholders from a global portfolio of assets.

In the UK, its investments include the operation of a maximum security jail (Addiewell) on behalf of the Scottish Prison Service – and a hospital and three mental health facilities on behalf of two Birmingham NHS foundation trusts.

The result is a trust that is providing investors with a steady quarterly income – equivalent to 4.7 per cent a year – unaffected by lockdowns and the pandemic.

While HICL Infrastructure has been around for 15 years, investment trust JPMorgan Global Core Real Assets is in its infancy.

It was launched in September 2019 to invest not only in income generating infrastructure projects, but also real estate (commercial property) and transport (container ships and trains).

It has taken a while for the trust to make its investments – not helped by the pandemic – but it is now nigh on fully invested.

The result is an uptick in the quarterly dividend payments it is making – one penny per share compared to 0.75pence a year ago – and the promise of more income in the pipeline.

Philip Waller, part of the management team, says the trust's target income is between four and six per cent a year with the opportunity for a little capital growth on top.

'We see this trust primarily as a good portfolio diversifier for someone looking for income,' he says. 'It's investing in a spread of assets that are uncorrelated to each other, and to other financial assets such as equities.

'Further diversity comes from the fact that it has both unlisted and listed holdings and has exposure to nearly 650 infrastructure and transport assets and more than 200 real estate buildings. The portfolio is truly global.'

Three per cent of the fund is in UK assets. The income comes from the leasing of assets such as container ships, trains and industrial units, as well as investments in renewable energy projects.

Among its top holdings is a stake in US real estate trust Prologis, which specialises in logistics facilities.

Alan Brierley, an analyst at Investec Bank, recently issued a 'buy' note on the trust. This is after rating it a 'sell' as a result of the long time it was taking the managers to make its investments – and the share price trading at a premium to the value of the trust's underlying assets.

But with these issues largely resolved – the trust's premium is down to a reasonable 5.3 per cent – Brierley believes the JPMorgan fund provides investors with an important source of income diversification which should show 'defensive characteristics in more turbulent market conditions'.

The trust has assets valued at £200million, its stock market identification is BJVKW83, and annual charges total 0.71 per cent.

Although the current share price of 93p is below the £1 launch price, Brierley believes the prospects for asset growth and attractive dividends are encouraging.

Hang onto your hats. Aston Martin has taken the top off its Valkyrie hypercar to launch its fastest ever open-topped model to give owners an experience that is as close to being a Formula One driver you can get.

The new Valkyrie Spider has been unveiled on Thursday evening among the super-rich at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in Monterey, California, and takes inspiration from the AMR21 machine used by Aston's official F1 team this season.

Powered by the same 1,155 horsepower petrol electric hybrid 6.5-litre V12 combination in the hard-top version, it accelerates from rest to 62mph in under three seconds up to a top speed of 217mph with the roof on, and 205mph with the roof off.

But it also blows the roof off the prices, too. Lucky buyers will pay a £1million premium for the privilege, with the Spider costing £3.5million compared to the £2.5million asking price for the hard-top version.

Going 205mp with the roof off: Aston Martin has revealed an open-top version of its Valkyrie hypercar - and the Spider will cost £1million more than its hard-top sibling

There is a limited run of 85 cars worldwide with deliveries of both left-hand and right-hand drive models scheduled to begin in the second half of next year.

However, you can put your money away now as Aston Martin says they have already been sold and are over-subscribed following 'unprecedented demand' for the supremely-fast open-top hypercar.

Aston Martin says the new Valkyrie Spider is the 'fastest, most extreme open top Aston Martin to date' and provides 'a thrilling next step in the progression of the Aston Martin Valkyrie bloodline'.

It says the combination of F1-inspired aerodynamics and performance with open roof driving 'epitomises true Formula One car experience, on the road'.

The removable roof panel offers the 'ultimate sensory immersion for driver and passenger' and an 'exhilarating Formula 1 experience on the road'.

Unveiling the car, the British maker - with its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire - told VIP guests in California: 'This a thrilling next-step in the progression of the Aston Martin Valkyrie bloodline.

Powered by the same 1,155 horsepower petrol electric hybrid 6.5-litre V12 combination in the hard-top version, it accelerates from rest to 62mph in under three seconds up to a top speed of 217mph with the roof on, and 205mph with the roof off. Listen to the incredible sound it makes in the video below

'It promises an even more intense experience.

'One shaped by the unbeatable sensory stimulus that comes with roof-off driving in one of the world's most extreme hypercars.

'One that delivers the most comparable experience to that of an F1 car, not limited to the track.'

It said the the Valkyire Spider has benefitted from unique engineering solutions born from the combined talents of Aston Martin and Red Bull Advanced Technologies (RBAT).

The firm said: 'While the Aston Martin Valkyrie's unique 1,155PS hybrid V12 powertrain remains unchanged, the Valkyrie Spider has received revisions to its carbon fibre structure, plus precise recalibration of both the active aerodynamic and active chassis systems.

There is a limited run of 85 Spiders (right) worldwide. However, you can put your money away now as Aston Martin says they have already been sold and are over-subscribed following 'unprecedented demand'

'This is all with an eye to maintaining optimal Valkyrie performance when driven in a roof-off condition'.

It said the key to the Valkyrie Spider's performance is the ultra-lightweight construction and high downforce aerodynamics package.

It explained: 'The upper body surfaces of the teardrop-shaped cockpit and lower tub contours follow the envelope of space available between the huge full-length Venturi tunnels that run either side of the cockpit floor.

'Drawing huge quantities of air beneath the car to feed the rear diffuser, these tunnels are the key to generating Aston Martin Valkyrie Spider's extraordinary levels of downforce, while keeping the upper body surfaces free from additional aerodynamic devices that would spoil the purity of the open-top styling.'

And it boasted bluntly: 'It's the fastest and most extreme open-top, road-legal Aston Martin ever built and is 'simulated to set impressive lap times, not normally achievable in a road-going car'.

Inside the driver has a near-central seating positioning, strapped down by a six-point safety harness to keep the occupants safely locked in place.

The stunning automotive specimen has been unveiled on Thursday evening among the super-rich at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in Monterey, California

A centre rear-view camera system and front- and rear-parking sensors aid the driver at both high and low speeds, with displays sitting just above the instrument panel.

The bespoke, removable lightweight roof comprises of a carbon fibre central panel, latching onto the tub at the rear and to the windscreen surround at the front. It also has a pair of polycarbonate roof windows, hinged on either side.

Aston Martin said: 'On opening the doors, the roof can simply be lifted off and stowed away. Modifications to the carbon fibre tub have been made to support the removable roof panels and the luxury open-top layout, as well as new doors. '

Front-hinged dihedral doors, unique to Valkyrie Spider, have been redesigned to tilt forwards.

Speaking at the unveiling, Aston Martin chief executive officer Tobias Moers said: 'The Aston Martin Valkyrie is the product of incredible innovation and technology, but above all it has always been about emotion. With the Valkyrie Spider we are taking that passion and emotion to the next level.

'The driving experience promises to be truly sensational. The sound of that 6.5-litre V12 engine revving to over 11,000rpm with the roof removed is something I cannot wait to hear.'

Red Bull Racing's chief technical officer Adrian Newey added: 'Right from the very beginning of the Aston Martin Valkyrie project we were driven by exacting targets that went way beyond any previous road car and the Valkyrie Spider brings that same ethos to the open cockpit hypercar category.

'What you see is a simple removable roof panel, but the challenge of remaining true to the Valkyrie concept was anything but. Maintaining aerodynamic performance with the roof removed was of paramount importance, likewise keeping any unavoidable weight gains to an absolute minimum whilst maximising enjoyment for the driver.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Just over a year ago, we took out a new mortgage to move home – fixing for five years at 1.4 per cent.

In historic terms, that was astonishingly cheap money.

Yet, if I wanted the same five-year fixed mortgage from the same bank today, the rate would be just 1.04 per cent - and if I wanted the lowest five-year fix on the market it would scrape in under the 1 per cent mark, with either HSBC or Nationwide.

Mortgage rates are so low that some could now lock in for five years at less than 1%

I knew back then that mortgage rates were likely to come down further, having witnessed them barely shift despite the coronavirus emergency base rate cuts, but I didn’t have the luxury of waiting. I needed to buy the house.

And, in all honesty, I didn’t think they’d fall quite this far within a year – particularly as last summer people were expecting the property market to tank rather than boom.

And yet boom it did. House prices have jumped and a temporary stamp duty cut added fuel to the fire.

Meanwhile, lockdown savings fortified some people’s finances, leading to less bad debts inflicted on banks than expected, and more firepower for those with itchy feet for moving home.

This has meant that 18 months into a global pandemic, we find ourselves in the odd position of banks and building societies that battened down the hatches now slamming into reverse.

The mortgage battle that was being contested before the pandemic and lockdowns struck is back on. And while small deposit borrowers aren’t yet fully feeling the love, those with hefty deposits or equity are being offered the cheapest rates ever.

Those cheap rates are a key ingredient in house prices at levels that are almost as expensive as they have ever been compared to wages.

The question being asked is how much lower rates can go? In this comprehensive look at why mortgage rates are falling and how low can they go, Helen Crane canvassed mortgage experts and brokers’ opinions on that.

Some reckoned the current cheapest 0.83 per cent two-year fix (with Halifax through selected brokers, or 0.87 per cent elsewhere) might already be near rock bottom, while others suggested we could be headed all the way down to 0.5 per cent.

The steady grinding down of mortgage rates to their current record lows has allowed house prices to remain almost as expensive as they have ever been compared to wages

Time will tell, but for now borrowers will be wondering whether to grab one of these cheap deals or bide their time.

Those moving home will have little choice on that – in almost all circumstances they have to take the rates on offer that fit their transaction timing – but remortgagers have a bit more flexibility.

Yet, with rates already so low, a few percentage points here or there often don’t make a huge difference.

Even in my case where rates have dropped a full 0.4 per cent, the saving proved to not be as much as I thought it could be.

The best five-year fixed rate we could get today is 0.99 per cent, and that would theoretically save us £72 per month, or £3,456 in total over the remaining four years.

This is nothing to be sniffed at, it’s always worth trying to save some money, and I’d rather we had that money than the bank, but it’s not enough to consider sucking up a roughly £16,000 early repayment charge and switching.

We are lucky to be more than a decade into home ownership and have never extended the term when we moved home or remortgaged, so despite the eye-watering size of our mortgage the rate difference is cushioned.

For those with longer terms, rate differences will be greater, and it might be worth considering switching, but check your early repayment charges, all other fees and compare rates properly first.

The real win is for those on standard variable rates, who are likely to have no early repayment charges, and could potential save substantial sums.

The question I ponder though is whether the next time I remortgage or move rates will be lower than the one I am on now?

To be honest, I hope not. Because alongside the steady grinding down of mortgage rates has come a burst of house price inflation that makes moving home more expensive, hampers the economy, and harms those hoping to own their home.

I’d gladly take higher mortgage rates and lower house price inflation.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Back pain is no longer reserved for the middle-aged – it appears two-thirds of under-30s suffer too, and experts are blaming the work-from-home culture.

After 1,000 18- to 29-year-olds took part in a poll, Dr Gill Jenkins, GP and adviser to campaign group Mind Your Back, which conducted the research, said: ‘Half of young people don’t have access to a table and supportive chair during their working day, while 20 per cent have to work while sitting on a sofa or bed.

‘This plays havoc with posture and spine health.’

Working from home has led to an increasing number of young people complaining about back pain

PTSD comfort ...in a ribbon

A special ribbon worn round the neck can help people who fear the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder in crowded places by alerting the public to their condition. More than a million suffer the mental health condition, characterised by disturbing flashbacks, nightmares and panic attacks linked to a previous traumatic experience.

One of the most common environments to suffer a panic attack is a crowded public place such as a supermarket or railway station. It is hoped sufferers who wear the new ribbon, which carries the letters ‘PTSD’ in bold and is backed by charity Sapper Support, will be given the appropriate help in an emergency.

Anthony Cowburn, 50, from Weymouth, who suffered severe PTSD after a 30-year career in Army combat, described the ribbon as a ‘comfort blanket’.

One in five Britons do not believe what the Government says about Covid-19, according to a new report. And barely a third say they have ‘a lot’ of trust in the scientific data announced in televised briefings and on the Government website.

Researchers from the University of Bristol asked more than 2,000 people if they trusted the official information about coronavirus when it first struck in March 2020.

Older adults were the most trusting, with those aged 18 to 34 and from ethnic-minority backgrounds the least trusting.

The authors say more work is needed to understand whether it is the information itself that people find hard to believe, or if the problem lies with those delivering it.

More than four in five Britons are concerned about catching Covid at work. Despite a majority of working-age adults being fully vaccinated and Covid case numbers remaining stable, 81 per cent of workers who took part in a poll worry they could be infected by colleagues.

Meanwhile, nearly 60 per cent of employers said they are amending sick leave policies to ensure employees are paid in full when they cannot work due to Covid self-isolation.

The survey of employees across 500 UK companies, was conducted by Covid testing firm Vatic.

Kelly teamed her jumpsuit with white trainers, ensuring maximum comfort for the radio presenter.

Accessorising the outfit, she opted for a black quilted bag with chain detailing, which she slung over her left shoulder, and donned two necklaces.

The natural beauty kept it simple with her make up, with subtle eye shadow and a slick of nude lipstick.

It comes after Kelly revealed in June that it was 'so lonely' backstage on The Masked Dancer as the contestants had to keep their identities secret from each other and couldn't chat.

Speaking about not knowing who anyone was in the show, Kelly said: 'Yes it was so lonely backstage!

'We walk around with these jumpers on that say ''don't speak to us''.

Looking good: She made the cornflour blue and white ensemble a bit more casual by donning white trainers, ensuring maximum comfort for the radio presenter

'You're just backstage at Wembley thinking, is everyone else as terrified as I am?

'Because you don't have that camaraderie, so you can't share any of your experience, so you think you're the only one freaking out.

'But since the show has aired and we've figured out who everyone is, I've been talking to you Howard [Donald] and Bonnie [Langford], and everyone's like ''did you do this, did you feel like this'' and everyone was in the same boat really.'

The trio also discussed whether Kelly managed to correctly guess any of the other contestants, which included Zoe Ball as Llama and Christopher Dean as Beagle.

Kelly told Amanda and Jamie: 'Not really…I couldn't bear not knowing so I went on Twitter and once I saw all the fans guessing, then things started to make sense.

'I knew then that Squirrel must be Bonnie [Langford] because only Bonnie can move like that! To be honest I thought it was Ashley Roberts!'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Eamonn Holmes has joked that he regrets not keeping his hip bones following his double hip surgery in 2016.

The 61-year-old's hilarious comments were made during Monday's This Morning, when he was interviewing Alison Hawthorn, who makes jewellery using her own breast milk.

Reflecting on the idea of turning parts of the human body into wearable pieces, Eamonn hilariously quipped: 'I always regret when I got my hips replaced that I didn't keep them. You'd have mounted something for me, wouldn't you?'

Regrets: Eamonn Holmes, 61, joked on Monday's This Morning that he regrets not keeping his hip bones following his double hip surgery in 2016

Eamonn's co-host and wife, Ruth Langsford, struggled to stop smiling, while his comment also left Alison, 30, grinning.

Of his hips, Eamonn added: 'You'd have got something sorted out for those.'

During the interview, Alison told Eamonn and Ruth, also 61, that she's 'loving' the process, adding: 'The orders are coming through.'

Alison decided to try and make her first 'keepsake' last year using her own breastmilk while feeding her twin sons, now aged 17 months.

After the pretty trinket - a keyring - turned out well, she began offering her services to others who wanted to transform their own breastmilk into something they can keep forever.

Craftswoman: Alison, 30, makes jewellery using her own breast milk and made her first 'keepsake' last year using her own breastmilk while feeding her twin sons

After expanding the business to make jewellery from ashes, pet fur and human hair, she claims she has been inundated with orders.

To make the jewellery, a customer sends at least 10ml of expressed breastmilk, double bagged and in a padded envelope to Alison.

From there, she uses a double boiling method and adds preservation powder, before leaving it to dry for a few days on greaseproof paper.

After this, Alison crushes it into a fine powder with a pestle and mortar and adds it to the resin to create the jewellery.

Eamonn's side-splitting comment comes after he left This Morning viewers bewildered after comparing Dr Zoe Williams hair to an alpaca's during Thursday's show.

Oh dear: Eamonn's side-splitting comment comes after he left This Morning viewers bewildered after comparing Dr Zoe Williams hair to an alpaca's during Thursday's show

The Irish presenter was running through the programme's topics as he introduced the doctor who said via video chat that she would be discussing, 'how your health can be benefited from gardening and even alpacas'.

Quick to jump in, Eamonn remarked: 'Your hair reminds me of an alpaca today! You just want to pet it, don't you? It's very alpaca-ish' before gesturing with a petting motion.

Collapsing with laughter, Dr Zoe, 41, exclaimed, 'Don't touch my hair!' as she pointed her pen at the camera.

While Dr Zoe took the joke in her stride, viewers were left shocked at the comments, taking to Twitter to pen: 'Uh Eamonn what tf was that about? Have u learnt nothing?! U never talk about petting a black woman's hair. And saying it looks like an Alpaca?! #thismorning'.

Come again? While Dr Zoe took the joke in her stride, viewers were left shocked at the comments and took to Twitter to voice their shock

'Did @EamonnHolmes just tell a black woman her hair reminds him of an alpaca and he wants to pet her or am I hallucinating?! Persevering face #ThisMorning'; '@thismorning did @EamonnHolmes just compare the doctors Afro to an alpaca?!?';

'Jesus, Mary and Joseph and the wee donkey Eamonn what did you just say to Dr Zoe? Have you learnt nothing?! never talk about petting a #blackwoman's #hair. Never ever say it looks like an Alpaca?! #thismorning I don't watch 'normal' telly, only on holiday, now I know why.'

Eamonn was quick to clear up that he meant no offence, taking to Twitter himself to pen: 'Hey everyone out there.

'If my attempt at being humorous with my friend @DrZoeWilliams was misjudged I am mortified and humbly apologise to anyone who was offended.'

'I've always said 'the only way to be on time is to be early'; it's nice to see you taking after me already, though you seem to have inherited your Mum's looks...

'Privately we've endured what so many parents-to-be have, your journey to us wasn't a straight line whatsoever, it was a rollercoaster right up to your arrival...

'I didn't allow myself to express my excitement as much as I'd have liked to, I wanted to freely shout about how excited I was about you joining us, but I was frightened...

'We had scare after scare during the worst of which, I said to your Mama 'if he does make it, he's grounded'...

'Having met you, I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault and you're totally forgiven. You're far too perfect to be mad at. As mum's go, you've lucked out; you have the best example of what a brave, strong, passionate, loving, kind and both considered and considerate woman is...'

'I feel a bit useless sometimes, pedestrianised; left to spectate from the sin bin as each phase plays out. It's humbling; never do our strengths as men compare to that of a woman. I'm awestruck. Subservient (albeit reluctantly at times.

'I’m curious about everything to come; about who and how you’ll be, what you’ll look and sound like... and who’ll be the stricter parent.

'A friend told me the best thing you can do for your own anxiety is to have a child. It sort of made sense at the time, it doesn’t anymore; THIS HAS BEEN WILD.

'My understanding of mortality and just how fragile life is have grown exponentially. Wishing you all (and hoping for) a very joyous and healthy 2021. Happy new year.' [sic]

'Don't get me wrong it is hard but I am so lucky that I have got an amazing family who love Santi so much xx'

This comes after Dani split from boyfriend Sammy last month when he was slapped with a three year prison sentence.

Sammy, 25, was found guilty of £34k worth of fraud and lied to Dani about his crimes.

He duped Peter Martin, 91, and Peter Haynes, 81, by persuading the vulnerable pensioners to let him invest their money for them and then splashed out on expensive restaurants, hotels and clothes.

His victims had been clients of Sammy when he worked as Senior Trader at Equine Global Sports Limited, a company which subsequently went into liquidation.

The company received money from customers which it would use to place bets on horse races, on their behalf.

After this company ceased trading, he contacted two of his elderly clients and pretended he would continue investing their money in the same way, but instead used it to fund his lifestyle, paying for restaurants and booking a hotel in Ibiza.

Dani and Sammy first began dating prior to her appearance on Love Island in 2018 and split before rekindling their romance in 2019.

The pair announced they were expecting their first child together in July 2020 and Dani and Sammy welcomed son Santiago in January, earlier this year.

According to Screen Daily, Bono made a speech before the film praising the city saying: 'It’s as if there are two Sarajevos – the real and the imagined.

'The one that you live and work in and we visit; and this mythic Sarajevo, a place of fun and magic.'

It comes two months after the superstar enjoyed a blow-out birthday bash with his nearest and dearest in London.

Joined by his daughters Eve and Jordan, 32, Bono and his family rang in his 61st year at the upmarket Scott's in Mayfair.

Two days later Bono, Ali and Behind Her Eyes star Eve – whose birthday falls on the same day as her famous father's - were spotted continuing the celebrations over lunch at the River Café in Hammersmith, with Bono making time for a chinwag with the eatery's owner, Ruth Rogers.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Deliveroo shares jumped this morning after it revealed that German rival Delivery Hero has taken a 5.09 per cent bite of the online food delivery company.

The stock lifted as much as 10 per cent in early trading to its highest level since the company floated on the London stock exchange at the end of March, at a price of 390p.

Deliveroo shares were up 6.4 per cent to 345.85p shortly after London market close today.

Berlin-based Delivery Hero took a 5.09% stake in Deliveroo

Delivery Hero said they 'strongly' believed in Deliveroo's future potential.

'We can confirm that Delivery Hero has taken a 5.09 per cent stake in Deliveroo,' the company said.

'Delivery Hero is always looking for new investment opportunities. We strongly believe in the future potential of the delivery industry as a whole, and therefore decided to purchase shares in one of the companies that is at its forefront.'

Like other food delivery companies, Deliveroo has benefited from rising demand for home-delivered meals during the pandemic lockdowns, with the company posting an 88 per cent rise in orders in the second quarter.

However, its float on the London stock market has been widely touted as a flop after its share price plunged more than 30 per cent on its debut as investors worried over the company's business model and status of its riders.

At the end of June, Deliveroo won the latest showdown in the long-running legal battle with trade union Independent Workers Union of Great Britain about the status of its riders.

Senior judges ruled its 'roos' can be classed as self-employed contractors rather than 'workers' – meaning the company need not provide them with the same rights as staff such as sick pay and annual leave.

Today's stake acquisition by Delivery Hero comes amid a growing number of cross-shareholdings in the sector of late.

Berlin-based Delivery Hero, which was founded in 2011, does not operate in Britain after selling its Hungryhouse business to Just Eat in 2016.

However, it owns a 7.4 per cent stake in Just Eat Takeaway.com.

The company also owns a 37 per cent stake in Spain's Glovo, which is considering its own listing in about three years.

It has operations in about 50 countries worldwide, with a focus on Asia, where it owns online food and grocery delivery platform foodpanda.

Deliveroo publishes its first-half results on Wednesday, with analysts expecting it to post higher revenues.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: 'Full year revenues are estimated to rise by 53 per cent from 2020 levels of £1.2billion, to £1.8billion so any sort of number close to a £1billion for H1 is likely to be well received.'

Motor insurer Admiral reported a 76 per cent surge in first-half earnings and announced a special dividend after it paid out fewer claims during months of government lockdowns amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Provident Financial has recorded a loss of £44.2million in the first six months of the year, which was a bigger loss than last year due to heavy costs relating to a planned wind-down of its doorstep lending business.

Heathrow Airport recorded its highest number of monthly passengers since the Covid-19 pandemic last month as 1.5 million people travelling through the airport after restrictions were eased.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Stock markets around the world have taken a tumble, with the FTSE 100 falling into correction territory.

But while the leading London index fell 10 per cent from its peak, some popular shares dropped by much more.

On this latest episode of the Investing Show we look at the companies that fell the most in the month leading up to this week, both in the FTSE 100 and on the AIM market.

Big names have been hurt by warnings on profits and individual disappointments, including Royal Mail, Thomas Cook and Superdry, but even firms that had been doing well have slipped – such as Hargreaves Lansdown and easyJet.

The real pain in many people’s portfolios will have been felt in some former stock market stars listed on AIM, however. Here Fevertree and Burford Capital have suffered big falls after gaining astonishing amounts in recent years.

Simon Lambert, Richard Hunter and Nick Batsford take a look at whether it is time to worry or bargain hunter - and at what's gone up as the market went down.

On the show we discuss the biggest fallers (and FTSE All Share risers) at the start of this week. This has changed slightly since and below is an updated list of fallers and risers.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investment bankers in London and New York are poised for their biggest bonuses in a decade amid a huge surge in deal-making.

As the economy rebounds from the pandemic, banks are reaping the rewards from a frenzy of stock market floats and corporate takeovers, a report says.

The bonanza has boosted profits, and many are now putting big sums aside to hand out. Bonuses this year could soar by as much as 35 per cent, says consultancy firm Johnson Associates.

Deal bonanza: As the economy rebounds from the pandemic, banks are reaping the rewards from a frenzy of stock market floats and corporate takeovers, claims a new report

Many lenders froze or cut bonus pools last year because of the Covid-19 crisis. But the massive bounce back since then, coupled with rising complaints from junior bankers about long hours, means rewards are on the rise again.

Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, said: ‘The industry has performed at a level that last year we thought was impossible.’

His firm expects investment bankers in advisory roles to see bonuses rise by 20 to 25 per cent, while those working in underwriting are set for a 30 to 35 per cent increase.

British banks HSBC, Lloyds and Barclays are among those increasing bonus pools, while Natwest is reviewing the matter.

Barclays increased its bonus pool from £749million to £1.1billion this year, while HSBC has topped up its own by £650million in the first half. Lloyds will spend an extra £100million on bonuses.

Pay is expected to rise at Wall Street banks as well. Goldman Sachs has hiked pay by £2.5billion compared to a year ago, while JP Morgan has raised it by £1.4billion.

Along with rival Morgan Stanley, the US banks have raised pay for junior bankers as well after complaints about working conditions.

The rise in bonuses is also likely to prove controversial among politicians and campaigners, at a time when the economy is under pressure from the pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the architects of Thatcherism has damned Morrisons’ suitors as ‘vulture capitalists’ keen to asset strip the grocer.

Lord Vinson, 90, who co-founded the Centre for Policy Studies with Margaret Thatcher, said a private equity buyer would look to extract £1billion from its property portfolio.

The Tory peer believes staff at Morrisons supermarkets should be ‘really frightened’ by the prospect of the grocer losing its independence, adding it will ‘leave this country poorer’.

Tory peer Lord Vinson, who co-founded the Centre for Policy Studies with Margaret Thatcher (pictured), said the former Prime Minister 'wouldn't have liked' Morrisons' private equity deal

He demanded Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng step in, adding that even Mrs Thatcher would have ‘disliked’ the deal.

The comments came as Clayton Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), under the former Tesco boss Terry Leahy, prepares to raise its bid for Morrisons and overtake the consortium led by Fortress, which upped its offer to £6.7billion, or 272p per share, last week.

Lord Vinson said: ‘Mrs Thatcher might have said “It’s the market and you take the rough with the smooth”, but fundamentally she wouldn’t have liked it.

‘It doesn’t bring any benefit except to the bidders. I’m all for free markets and free trade, but there comes a point where it should be conducted within a moral framework.

There is only one reason for US vulture capital’s interest in Morrisons, they want to trouser a billion pounds. They want to take money out of the business by asset-stripping.’

He added: ‘We’ve seen it happen so often, as with Debenhams. Why can’t somebody in the Government say: “We don’t like the look of this?”’

He called for all takeover bids over a certain size to be referred to a beefed-up Competition and Markets Authority.

A series of big City and Westminster names including former Iceland boss Bill Grimsey, Darren Jones, the chairman of the MPs’ business committee, and Labour peer Lord Sikka have raised concerns.

Fortress, whose bid has been recommended by Morrisons’ board, has pledged to protect jobs and maintain a substantial chunk of the property portfolio.

The promises are not legally binding. Sources have suggested that CD&R, which also owns B&M, will publish its own pledges when it returns with a fresh bid.

Fortress said: ‘We are focusing on long-term sustainable value creation and place very significant emphasis on the wider responsibilities of ownership.’

Analysts say a sale of assets is likelier if the price rises above 270p a share, as a buyer seeks to claw back its investment.

On Monday, the Takeover Panel confirmed an extension to the deadline for CD&R to bid to 5pm on August 20.

The date for shareholders to vote on Fortress’s offer has been pushed back 11 days – to August 27.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The decision whether to invest in Medica Group, the provider of services to hospital radiology departments, largely comes down to how fast you think elective surgery rates will recover to pre-pandemic levels.

In a recent trading update covering the first half of the year, the company reported 'a sustained recovery in activity in diagnostic services'.

Medica's customer base comprises more than 100 NHS trusts, as well as Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) plus many private hospital and insurance groups, and it is well-known that there is a growing backlog of surgery waiting to be performed.

Medica Group provides services to hospital radiology departments

Management revealed in the July trading update that elective surgery activity is back to 75 per cent of pre-Covid levels and the board is counting on the release of pent-up demand for its services, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computerised tomography), ultrasound and plain film (x-ray) scans, to drive growth into and beyond 2022.

The elective surgery part of the business accounts for around 35 per cent of revenues and so a speedy return to more normal levels of elective surgery would certainly ginger up the top-line.

It seems obvious, however, that the ability of healthcare organisations to clear this backlog of operations (and thus spark increased demand for Medica's teleradiology services) is dependent on them not being overwhelmed with emergency care for Covid-19 sufferers.

It is probably too early to call it one way or the other as we wait for the effects of the July loosening of lockdown restrictions to become apparent but – touch wood – the signs look promising.

As of 8 August, 47million people in the UK had received at least one vaccine jab and 39.4million had received a second, which should contribute to keeping hospital admissions at manageable levels.

Meanwhile, more than two-thirds of 18-30-year-olds have had their first jab, which should allay some fears about this age group being hesitant to receive the vaccine.

While the seven day average of the number of daily admissions to UK hospitals has risen from around 100 in mid-May to 742 in early August, this is nowhere near this year's peak of 4,126 cases seen in early January and is showing signs of waning in any case.

Before the coronavirus pandemic changed everything, things had been going fairly swimmingly for the group, with double-digit percentage revenue growth each year for ten years.

The group has a stated ambition to double revenues from 2020's level by 2025 by consolidating what it believes is a leadership position in UK teleradiology services while branching out into allied areas of growth.

More than 85 per cent of its revenues in 2019 (i.e. pre-pandemic) came from repeat business, via customers who had been with the group for at least two years.

Medica's bespoke information technology platform is described as 'robust and secure' and is scalable, which is to say the company can take on new clients without significantly requiring heavy capital expenditure.

That being said, the company is investing in the platform, seeking to enhance functionality and provide proprietary (i.e. Medica-owned) interfaces between its customers and Medica's team of radiologists.

In July, Medica said that it was counting on a rise in demand for its services, which include MRI scans and X-rays, among the others

House broker Liberum, commenting on the half-year trading update, said better cost control and an improved business mix 'means gross margins are likely to be at least in-line with last year, which is well ahead of current consensus forecasts'.

Of equal importance to the elective surgery business to Medica is its Nighthawk out of hours radiology reporting business, which also generates around 35 per cent of group revenues.

Dr Stuart Quin, the chief executive of Medica, told investors in July that the recovery of elective scanning activity in health services is now well underway and Medica is seeing a sustained recovery in elective scanning volumes as a result.

The NightHawk business in the UK is also putting in a solid performance due to continued growth from existing customers, he added.

The company is not pinning its hopes solely on a resurgence in non-Covid-related operations in the UK to fuel growth; it is also expanding into new markets and services in the US, Ireland and Australia.

As in the UK, the group saw eye-catching growth in the first half of the year in Ireland, where its services include diabetic retinopathy screening services.

The increase in scanning activity is putting pressure on radiology department capacity, providing the opportunity for Medica to step in and support out-of-hours reporting provision across Ireland. Meanwhile, the group's ophthalmology screening contract in Ireland reported a strong performance in the first half.

Elsewhere in the world, reported revenues for the US RadMD business, acquired in March of this year, have continued to grow although this growth has been tempered by a continuation of slower-than-normal patient recruitment into existing clinical trials due to the ongoing pandemic.

As restrictions are lifted across the US, Medica is starting to see patient numbers, and therefore RadMD's activity and order book conversion, increase.

Which brings us back to where we started, namely the company being somewhat hostage to fortune when it comes to how soon things can return to business as usual for healthcare organisations.

Medica's current share price of 163p means it is valued on 22 times forecast earnings for the current year, which is higher than the market average; however, since floating in 2017, the average price/earnings ratio of the stock has been 28.1, reflecting the unprecedented interruption to day-to-day proceedings in the healthcare world.

As normal service is resumed, that price/earnings ratio should head back up, suggesting now is an opportunistic time to buy the shares.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The high-flying Blue Whale Growth fund has reaped the rewards of the US stock market's bounce back from the coronavirus crash - delivering a 34 per cent gain for investors over the past six months.

The global fund - run by Stephen Yiu and backed by Peter Hargreaves - is invested heavily in the US, which accounts for 72 per cent of its holdings and its top ten features a raft of technology-related companies, including Adobe, Facebook and Microsoft.

Considering the remarkable run that US shares and the tech sector have been since the coronavirus crash lows at the end of March, has the market become detached from reality - as some suggest - or have the world's well-known digital names proved themselves far more resilient than people thought?

Stephen joins Simon Lambert on this episode of the Investing Show to share his views on what has happened with the market - and also why he sees some big names such as Facebook as value investments but would not buy Tesla or Netflix.

The Blue Whale fund holds just 25 companies from around the world, which it considers to have the best prospects, resilient business models and - perhaps surprisingly for a US and tech heavy growth fund - and to be good value.

In fact, Stephen describes himself as a value investor, but says that this involves looking to pick up companies at a good price, rather than the kind of bargain basement value investing strategy once described by legendary investor Ben Graham as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.

Stephen discusses how this philosophy fitted with using a high proportion of cash in the fund as the coronavirus crisis hit to add to holdings of Amazon and PayPal at a knock down price, but also then selling down some of those holdings after their share prices rocketed in the sharp recovery.

He also reveals why despite Tesla riding out the storm, he doesn't see the company as one he would invest in and why although Netflix's subscription model is highly attractive it suffers from the same business model problems as Premier League football clubs.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@According to Government statistics, more than 60 per cent of adults in this country are overweight or obese and rising numbers of children are carrying too many pounds as well.

The economic cost of this is estimated at almost £30billion, the psychological impact can be intense and even the environment is suffering from consumers' enthusiasm for junk food.

Small wonder then that last week's National Food Strategy, a Government-commissioned review, pulled no punches, recommending the introduction of salt and sugar taxes and arguing that meat consumption should be cut by a third.

Tasty: With a 150-year heritage in sugar and syrup, Tate & Lyle may not seem the obvious candidate to benefit from growing fears about expanding waistlines

For many in the food industry, these proposals will strike alarm bells. For Tate & Lyle, however, the report will almost certainly prove welcome.

With a 150-year heritage in sugar and syrup, Tate & Lyle and its shares may not seem the obvious candidate to benefit from growing fears about expanding waistlines.

But the group sold off those legacy businesses in 2010, leaving two main divisions, one focused on turning corn into sweeteners and starches, the other on creating healthy ingredients for the food and drinks industry.

Last week, chief executive Nick Hampton went one stage further, announcing the sale of 50 per cent of the corn processing subsidiary for £1.2billion so he can scale up the fast-growing ingredients business.

American private equity firm KPS is buying the corn division and will run it as a standalone business but Tate & Lyle will benefit as and when the company grows and there is the prospect of particularly attractive returns if KPS sells the new firm outright.

In the short term, Tate & Lyle shareholders will be handed a £500 million special dividend, equivalent to around £1 a share, and Hampton will dedicate himself to developing more and more ingredients that replace sugar, fat and salt with healthier alternatives.

Splenda is probably the best-known of these, but the group works with some of the largest food and drink firms in the world so its products go into everything from iced tea to yogurt to tomato ketchup.

The business has already benefited from increasing concerns worldwide about obesity. Over the next few years, those worries are expected to deepen so Tate & Lyle's prospects in its new guise seem bright.

Midas verdict: Midas recommended Tate & Lyle in 2015, when the shares were £6.08. Today, the shares are £7.29, having fallen more than 10 per cent since Hampton first hinted at his break-up plans two months ago.

The decline seems unfair. Large investors have been complaining about the corn business for years. Now Hampton has offloaded it in a clever deal which allows Tate to retain an ongoing interest, while driving growth within the trendy ingredients division. Existing shareholders should retain their stock. New investors could even pick up some shares at current levels.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The takeover frenzy on the London stock market cranked up further as Stock Spirits was bought by a private equity firm.

CVC Capital Partners has agreed to buy the vodka-and-rum maker for £767million in a 377p-per-share deal.

Stock Spirits said it was the fifth unsolicited offer CVC had made.

Taking Stock: CVC Advisers has agreed to buy the vodka and rum maker for £767m in a 377p-per-share deal. Stock Spirits said it was the fifth unsolicited offer CVC had made

The deal is the latest in a string of companies to be swooped on by private equity businesses since the pandemic struck.

A staggering 123 firms had been bought between the start of the outbreak and May 2021.

The pandemic plundering has seen companies including Asda, Aggreko, Signature Aviation and LV fall into the hands of buyout barons.

And the likes of Ultra Electronics and Morrisons are now being circled.

Stock Spirits is focused on Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, the Czech Republic and Italy, which account for around 80 per cent of its sales.

Its best-known drinks include 1906, Stock Prestige and Syramusa.

The company, which has been dubbed a ‘mini Diageo’, has a portfolio of more than 70 own brands and about 70 third-party drinks which it distributes.

It is based in Buckinghamshire, but only has around two dozen employees there.

CVC’s offer is 41pc higher than the value of the company’s stock before the deal was announced.

But last night Stock Spirits’ shares rocketed 43.7 per cent, or 117p, to 385p, suggesting investors believe there will be a bidding war for the company.

Analysts agreed, with Shore Capital describing the bid as ‘modest’, adding: ‘An approach for Stock Spirits is understandable in our view given its leading market position across European markets, notably in Poland and Czech Republic.

‘It remains to be seen if the bid flushes out counter offers from the industry.’

Stock Spirits listed in London in 2013. It has had several spats with its largest shareholder, Western Gate Private Investments, including one earlier this year, when Western Gate slammed the board for pursuing an aggressive merger and acquisitions strategy instead of giving more money back to investors.

CVC’s plot to buy Stock Spirits was announced on the same day that it was successful in striking a deal to invest in Spanish football league, La Liga. The private equity group will invest £1.8billion in the organisation – around a 10 per cent stake.

It marks its first deal into a major European football league, although it has been heavily criticised by Spain’s two largest clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid.

CVC could be a controversial buyer for Stock Spirits. It is the largest private equity company in the UK and also one of the most ruthless.

Founded in 1981, CVC has been a breeding ground for some of the UK’s leading fund managers including Jon Moulton, Mike Smith and Frank Neale, who all went on to become titans of the industry.

The firm is notoriously private and likes to operate away from the public spotlight.

CVC has its tentacles across all parts of British life, most famously in retail.

In 2003 it was part of a consortium that bought Debenhams. CVC was accused of a quick flip, buying the retailer on the cheap, loading it with debt and then refloating it at a big profit.

Debenhams collapsed last year under mounting debts.

Last month CVC snapped up a significant stake in Six Nations Rugby. CVC also has stakes in Premiership Rugby, the Pro 14 and breakdown recovery company RAC.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The national lockdowns over the past year have given people plenty of time to reflect on their jobs, lifestyles and passions.

This has led many to embrace their entrepreneurial spirit and work on a hobby or idea that has always been on the back burner due to career commitments.

Olympic sailing champion Hannah Mills MBE, gold medal winner in Tokyo, found herself in the same situation after the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games were called off at the start of the pandemic last year. With training on hold, she had the time to develop her sustainable not-for-profit brand the Big Plastic Pledge.

Here's how she did it - and how you could bring your passions to life in the form of a side hustle or full-time career.

Point of sail

Hannah’s sustainable side hustle was launched in 2019 after the athlete, who won a silver medal at the Olympic Games London 2012 and a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Rio during 2016, was shocked by sailing through beaches, marinas and harbours that were littered with plastic.

She had always wanted to do something beyond sailing that gave her a feel-good factor, and tackling sustainability issues provided that opportunity.

'Growing up, I was obsessed with the Olympics and only thought about standing on the podium with a medal,' she says.

'I felt early on with my career that while I loved sailing, I wasn’t necessarily delivering on other personal values of giving back and making a difference to more than just my sport.'

The two-time world champion decided to use her sporting background, networks and profile to raise awareness, change behaviour and influence others on environmental issues through an initiative called the Big Plastic Pledge.

To turbocharge her efforts, she used GoDaddy. Through their Websites & Marketing product, she was able to take the website to the next level, reaching her target audience at scale with new online toolkits and even incorporating new ecommerce capabilities, enabling her to sell sustainably sourced products direct to customers.

Plus, GoDaddy is helping to take the Pledge to the next level by developing, redesigning and hosting new toolkits for Hannah’s network of Olympic ambassadors and to share tips with UK micro-businesses for ways to become more sustainable in their operations.

Riding the waves

She admits that the initial launch of the campaign, which aimed to eliminate single-use plastics from sport, felt rushed - but says the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games gave her time to focus on the future aims of the campaign initiative.

'With the onset of the pandemic, I wasn’t able to train, freeing up much of my time,' Hannah explains.

'I felt I was running to keep up with everything that was going on beforehand but the being out of my strict training regime gave me time to think about what we were doing and to focus on bringing athletes on board rather than doing lots of events.'

She also used the time in lockdown to upskill and took an eight-week sustainability course at a university which she said gave her a new perspective and clearer goals.

She explains: 'Learning again was really good and I came back to the Big Plastic Pledge with more clarity.'

This helped develop the pledge, which encourages athletes and people playing or involved in sport to commit to three out of nine sustainable changes.

These include refusing to use plastic straws and encouraging clubs and events to use alternatives to plastic.

More than 3,000 people have signed the pledge so far and Hannah is working with other athletes to promote it, and she's pushing the pledge as part of her role as a European Climate Pact Ambassador for the International Olympic Committee too.

Making dreams a reality with GoDaddy

Gaining traction through any type of business or campaign in a pandemic was always going to be a challenge due to restrictions on seeing people face-to-face. But Hannah says her website has played a key part in communicating the message clearly.

'We wanted the Big Plastic Pledge to be accessible globally and that is why we needed a website with the products and tools on-hand for us to deliver our message effectively.'

Via GoDaddy, Hannah has been able to spread her sustainability message on an international scale without needing any marketing expertise.

Their Website + Marketing package, for example, has ready-made templates for social media posts and marketing communications. All you need to do is fill in the details then GoDaddy does the hard work for you, giving your fledgling idea the support it needs to get off the ground.

For Hannah, this isn’t just a temporary side hustle. She says she's in it for the long haul and still plans to make waves with her campaign once she retires from sailing.

'My passion and my drive is all around sustainability and sport,' she says.

'I want to maximise the network I have got through sailing and the Olympics to make a difference.

'These toolkits, built and launched in partnership with GoDaddy, make it manageable and achievable for businesses to cut down on plastics on an individual level, and have the potential to be incredibly powerful if used in numbers.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New drivers are being urged to watch out for bogus car insurance deals being promoted on social media, as thousands of learners are hoping to pass their test following more than a year of disruption.

Fake car insurance sales - known as 'ghost broking' - is a growing scam that involves fraudsters pretending to be insurance brokers in order to sell unrealistically cheap and subsequently fake policies.

These are often advertised to younger drivers - who often face paying out four figure sums for cover - via Facebook and Instagram, according to research from the Insurance Fraud Bureau.

The not-for-profit organisation is now warning learner drivers to be careful when purchasing insurance online as it could cost them their first car.

New drivers are urged to watch out for bogus car insurance deals promoted on social media

There is set to be a large influx of new drivers on the horizon following confirmation from the Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency that driving test centres face an unprecedented challenge to reduce waiting times left by the pandemic.

While learner drivers in a driving school are typically covered by their instructor's insurance policy until they pass their test, they will need to take out motor insurance for their first car.

However, with a rush of new drivers approaching and with so many people facing financial hardship, the IFB is concerned it will provide an opportunity for ghost broker scammers.

Stephen Dalton, head of intelligence and investigations at the IFB, said: 'The last thing new drivers need right now is to risk losing their car for no insurance because they've been duped by a scammer on social media.

'Drivers must carry out basic checks to make sure they're buying car insurance through a trusted provider, or they'll be making a very expensive mistake.'

Mark Magee, Head of Driver Policy at the DVSA, added: 'The DVSA's priority is to help everyone through a lifetime of safe driving.

'As well as ensuring you have the skills, knowledge and understanding attitude to drive safely, having valid insurance is of the utmost importance when you drive on your own.

'Check to make sure insurance brokers are genuine before parting with your money.'

Fraudsters often tempt younger people with their bogus car insurance deals by promoting unrealistically cheap prices up front, despite the fact insurance is meant to be priced based on the risk of the individual.

They often then encourage contact with them through popular end-to-end encrypted messaging software such as WhatsApp.

Watch out: Fake car insurance sales known as ghost broking is a growing scam online

The IFB, an organisation that works with the police to crackdown on organised insurance scams, has seen its investigations into ghost broking double since 2016, and the scam has remained prevalent throughout the pandemic.

Investigations have found cash-strapped young drivers forking out hundreds of pounds for car insurance that in reality is worth no more than a photo shopped piece of paper.

In some cases scammers also use stolen personal information to take out policies which are then doctored before being sold on to customers.

Driving without valid insurance is easily detected by police. Uninsured drivers can have their vehicle instantly seized and are likely to receive six points on their licence.

They can also face court where they might receive an unlimited fine and a driving ban. Furthermore, an uninsured driving conviction will show on records and can affect job prospects.

If a collision is caused by the uninsured driver they may also be liable for covering the costs which can run into the thousands.

The pandemic has delayed learner drivers' gaining their license by an average of nine months

Pandemic delays learners by nine months

The problem of ghost broking could be exacerbated by the pandemic, which has led to long waiting lists for those sitting both their theory and practical tests, with a reported backlog of around 420,000 tests.

In fact, the Covid-19 pandemic delayed learner drivers' gaining their license by an average of nine months, according to research by GoCompare Car Insurance.

Lockdown restrictions meant driving lessons and driving tests were cancelled across the UK, causing chaos for thousands of learner drivers hoping to get legally on the roads.

Some 29 per cent of parents surveyed by Go Compare think the pandemic delayed their children passing their driving test by a whole year.

As a result, for some, the forced break has resulted in them giving up on plans to learn to drive altogether.

The survey of 1,000 people found 27 per cent have not returned to the driver's seat and 11 per cent are less inclined to get back in a car and learn to drive.

Separate research from the AA found the most common reason for drivers failing their test this year was observation at junctions closely followed by looking in their mirrors when changing direction and turning right at junctions.

As a result, the car insurer is urging learner drivers to ensure they are ready to take the test rather than simply booking quickly to avoid a longer wait.

Robert Cowell, AA Driving School interim managing director, said: 'Driving test slots are like gold dust right now due to an ever-growing backlog.

'As a result, learners may risk attempting a practical test before they're ready rather than face an extended wait and fail on these common test faults.

'Learning to drive is a vital life skill and it's important learners take the time to develop their experience at the right pace so they become safe, confident drivers.

'The last 18 months have created more pressures in all aspects of young people's lives and restrictions on learning to drive have added to this. The DVSA are releasing more test slots each month and we hope this will help the situation.'

Avoiding fake car insurance deals

New drivers are urged to avoid deals on social media or messaging apps and to only purchase car insurance through reputable sellers.

• If buying through an Insurance Broker they should check the seller is registered with the British Insurance brokers' Association.

• If buying directly through an insurer they should appear as a registered member of the Motor Insurers' Bureau.

• Checks can also be made to see Insurance Advisors are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority.

British fashion designer Sir Paul Smith has created a 'stripped-back' electric Mini that marks the start of a new collaboration and prepares the way for an expected 'special edition' runaround for customers.

The clothes designer has applied his eye for a stylish sharp suit to create the one-off back-to-basics version of the new green zero-emissions Mini that also encapsulates his trademark 'classic with a twist' philosophy – using cork, recycled plastic and a few surprises.

The 'Mini Strip' is described as 'a custom-made, one-off model' created to showcase the car-maker's green credentials and – with his signature on the dashboard - is given its world premiere today at his boutique in London's Mayfair.

Asked directly if it paves the way for a subsequent Paul Smith designer car for paying customers to buy, he teased: 'Watch this space'.

Mini Strip: This is the one-off custom Mini Electric created in partnership with British fashion designer, Sir Paul Smith, which has an interior made from recycled plastics and cork

Asked directly there will be a production version of the unique Mini Strip, Paul Smith said customers should 'watch this space'

The Mini Strip marks the second collaboration since 1999 between Mini and designer Sir Paul whose designs combine tradition and modernity.

He first collaborated with Mini with a limited-run special edition of the classic Mini.

The car was painted in a special shade of blue and sported neatly coordinated anthracite alloy wheels.

Also popular was a one-off creation - painted in Sir Paul's signature multicolour stripes - to mark the classic Mini's 40th birthday.

But it has also sparked a car fashion war, with British designer Stella McCartney signed up to do a similar job for Audi's electric e-tron range.

Sir Paul said: 'A few years ago I did a striped Mini. This time I wanted to have a more radical approach to designing the car – a stripped out Mini.'

He said the covid pandemic had left many people question the complexities of life and longing for more simplicity and sustainability: 'The world is getting too complicated. It is telling us: sort it out.'

He said he brought a fashion designer's eye, 'child-like naivety' and a fresh perspective to the task of 'shining the spotlight on the issue of sustainability in automotive design and manufacturing'.

He said he used his own trademark blue on the stripped back Mini which he believed looked 'absolutely fantastic'.

The car showcases 'inspirational ideas' for a more sustainable method of automotive design focussed on the overarching themes of: 'simplicity, transparency, and sustainability', he said.

Working with Mini's chief designer Oliver Heilmer the pair stripped down the Mini Electric to its 'structural essence' – then added only elements viewed as absolutely necessary.

Mini says cork 'could provide a substitute for foamed plastics in future'. It also 'fixes' carbon dioxide during its production giving 'potential for reducing greenhouse gases.' Sir Paul noted: 'Cork is very good acoustically and thermally. It's not bad for the top of a bottle of wine either'

The car was painted in a special shade of blue and sported neatly coordinated anthracite alloy wheels

With the exception of the dashboard, topper pad and parcel shelf, all trim parts have been stripped out, turning the exposed basic body-shell and vivid blue paintwork into the dominant visual feature of the cabin: 'It is bare yet feels 'dressed' at the same time,' he said.

But it comes with a classic 'Paul Smith' twist of unexpected details designed to delight.

Sir Paul explained; 'I'm a clothes designer, not a car or product designer. I like cars but I can't tell you much about them. I'm not a car-holic. But I've driven a Mini for 20 years.

'It's the joy of naivety where you are not cluttered by detail. The joy of having a child-like approach means you can be more radical. So I thought 'what if?'.

Bicycle enthusiast Sir Paul – who enjoys rolling up his sleeves occasionally and replacing or modifying his road bikes himself – provided the inspiration for the visible screws which show how simply the car could be dismantled and recycled at the end of its life.

Visible interior cable routing draws attention to functions normally concealed during manufacture and a large transparent panoramic roof made from recycled Perspex allows a view of the largely bare body-shell structure inside

The raw body was left in its unfinished state with no coloured paint applied, but instead just a thin film of transparent paint to protect against corrosion

The full interior of the Mini Electric donor car had to be removed in order to paint the shell a deep shade of midnight blue

Scratches, imperfections and 'distressed' elements are kept 'to indicate its hand-made and raw' nature.

The raw body was left in its unfinished state with no coloured paint applied, but instead just a thin film of transparent paint to protect against corrosion.

Grinding marks from the factory were consciously left on the galvanised steel panels to clearly identify the car as a functional object. Smith dubbed this intentionally rough-hewn effect: 'the perfect imperfection'.

Parts of the Mini have been 3D-printed from recycled plastic and their basic material qualities have been left exposed - like the metal panels.

Explaining other key touches Sir Paul pointed out that the interior is stripped of both leather and chrome. The floor mats are made from recycled rubber.

Sir Paul said his working tile for the project was 'MT' – as in 'empty' – and expressed his aim of 'emptying out' the existing car: 'It's a minimalist design. Less is more'

Opening the doors reveals the signature Paul Smith stripes in a vivid composition of five colours.

The charging flap opens to reveal a splash of neon green. The engraved drawing of an electric plug on the flap is Smith's own work.

Interior pull-handles in the door are made from twisted bright orange mountaineering rope (matching the seat-belts) and the door panels made from mesh expose the door structure.

Cork is used for the dashboard topper pad, door shoulders and parcel shelf and is fully recyclable as it contains no synthetic binding agents.

Mini says cork 'could provide a substitute for foamed plastics in future'. It also 'fixes' carbon dioxide during its production giving 'potential for reducing greenhouse gases.'

Sir Paul noted: 'Cork is very good acoustically and thermally. It's not bad for the top of a bottle of wine either'.

The simplified dashboard consists of one large, semi-transparent section with a smoked-glass finish.

In the absence of a central instrument display, the driver's smartphone becomes the media control centre.

Simple toggle switches are the only physical interior controls - for the power windows and the start/stop function. Sir Paul said he likes simple up and down toggle switches but hates complicated screen menus: 'It's the joy of simplicity. One night in Korea I had to throw a blanket over a TV set because I couldn't switch it off.'

Smith's collaboration with the British car maker dates back more than two decades

The steering wheel is made from scratch in aluminium and been reduced to essential functions. The rim is wrapped in bicycle handlebar tape 'in true road bike style'. Three aluminium spokes connect the rim to the impact absorber, whose mesh covering exposes the airbag behind.

A small, fabric Paul Smith label – as in his suits - in the one o'clock position celebrates his collaboration.

Visible screws indicate how easy it would be to dismantle to recycle the aluminium.

Seats are upholstered in a fully-recyclable knitted fabric and the side airbags in the roof pillar are exposed.

Visible interior cable routing draws attention to functions normally concealed during manufacture and a large transparent panoramic roof made from recycled Perspex allows a view of the largely bare body-shell structure inside.

Door openers are milled aluminium and housed in the cork door shoulders provide a high-class finishing touch.

Distinctive front and rear apron inserts were manufactured using 3D printing to produce their striking texture.

The blanked-off radiator grille and wheel covers are made from light recycled Perspex to help reduce drag and increase range.

Sir Paul said his working tile for the project was 'MT' – as in 'empty' – and expressed his aim of 'emptying out' the existing car: 'It's a minimalist design. Less is more.'

He explained that , just as with his clothing and suits where he would have a classic design on the outside, the lining inside would usually have a flash of extravagance and colour.

Seams and stitching are another chance to show some extra flare – both in his suits and on the Mini: 'Most of the action happens on the inside,' he said.

'I know and love the existing car, but by respecting the past and looking to the future we have created something very special,' Smith told us

Explaining other key touches Sir Paul pointed out that the interior is stripped of both leather and chrome. The floor mats are made from recycled rubber

Smith said: 'I feel very privileged that the Mini team have given me the confidence and freedom to think laterally about the approach to the design'

Some elements are a nod to his love of cycling and to the thrift inspired by his father:' I was brought up as a kid making do and getting by. It's a very interesting approach.

'My father was a very practical man – always in his garage and workshop and doing things by hand.

'We put the actual fixings on the outside of the car. That's why there are visible fixing points on the Mini as a nod to those days.'

In looking for ideas he admitted his office table was 'full of amazing and crazy things', most of which he discarded. But he said: 'You have to be brave enough to say: 'No, no ,no – wow- and pick the one that works. That spark is the start. It's so nice to have this zing that wakes us all up.'

As a designer with a passion for bicycles, books and more, Sir Paul said: 'I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to rethink the iconic Mini.

'I know and love the existing car, but by respecting the past and looking to the future we have created something very special.

'I feel very privileged that the Mini team have given me the confidence and freedom to think laterally about the approach to the design. Together, I think we have created something truly unique, by going back to basics, reducing things down and stripping the car.'

Head of Mini design Oliver Heilmer said: 'It shows in an impressive way that Mini and Paul Smith share the same bold way of thinking about the future in terms of innovation and design - and together we create more. We are proud to have developed such a strong character statement together.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The boss of Gatwick Airport has called on the Government to remove 'unnecessary and costly' PCR testing requirements for UK holidaymakers as the group slumped to a multi-million loss.

Stewart Wingate said that, despite 75 per cent of UK adults being double-vaccinated, travel risked lagging behind the US and Europe if the Government doesn’t simplify travel rules.

It comes amid rising concerns about rip-off PCR tests costing up to £400 each, as well as unreturned or delayed results, with MPs yesterday urging the Government to cap prices for these tests at £40.

Gatwick Airport said passenger numbers were 'very low' at just 569,000 in the first half

Health Secretary Sajid Javid wrote to the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog last week, asking it to urgently investigate firms profiteering off testing requirements.

The competition watchdog responded this week, saying it was ready to take enforcement action against testing firms if it finds they are breaching consumer law.

It comes after shocking pictures of uncollected £50-a-time samples piled high outside UK pharmacies.

'Our Government needs to act now and remove unnecessary and costly PCR testing requirements for passengers, particularly for those double vaccinated,' Gatwick chief executive Wingate said.

'UK travel recovery should not be allowed to lag behind the US and Europe.

'Passengers need the travel rules simplified so they can choose to travel more freely and enjoy much needed breaks and reunions with family and friends which are currently much more attainable for those in Europe and the US.'

The company is calling on the Government to remove all tests requirements for travellers from countries on the 'green' list and for double-vaccinated travellers returning from 'amber' list countries.

Non-vaccinated people returning from 'ambe' list countries should take a single lateral flow test, Gatwick added.

It comes as the group slumped to a pre-tax loss of £204million in the first half of the year as passenger numbers were 'very low' at just 569,000 due to the impact of Covid-related international travel bans.

An overflowing Randox bin Covid test last week

While the airport has remained open throughout the first six months of the year, it said that a collapse in passenger demand and Government restrictions had hit business hard.

The company also said it was in fresh talks with banks to avoid defaulting on its loans, as after a year requesting short-term waivers on its loans, it was again facing pressure.

The business was able to save £31.3million by slashing staff costs nearly in half after it made more than 40 per cent of its employees redundant last year.

'First I would like to thank all our staff for their hard work and fortitude throughout what has no doubt been the most challenging six months the airport has witnessed with its low passenger and air traffic volumes,' Wingate said.

'I remain certain that Gatwick will recover and as a business we are financially and operationally well placed for that.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Another key defence business was sold off yesterday as Babcock International offloaded a consultancy that does work on nuclear submarines and weaponry for Royal Navy warships.

The defence giant is selling Frazer-Nash Consultancy to American aerospace group KBR in a deal worth nearly £300million.

The deal will raise concerns that UK industry is rapidly losing companies and assets after the Covid crisis triggered a downturn in the aerospace sector.

Sell-off: The defence giant is selling Frazer-Nash Consultancy to American aerospace group KBR in a deal worth nearly £300m

It comes amid a wave of bids for key UK defence assets, with Meggitt and Ultra both being circled by American firms. The Government has been encouraged to step in to block the deals on national security grounds.

Frazer-Nash employs 900 people and has operations in Plymouth, Bristol and Glasgow. Its sale surprised some as it sits in the marine division of Babcock, which builds warships for the Royal Navy, including new aircraft carriers and Type 31 frigates, and which services the submarine fleet.

Frazer-Nash is also a lucrative double-digit margin consultancy. KBR will be getting a business that before the pandemic was making annual profits of £17m on revenues of £101m. The sale means Britain's second-largest defence contractor is steaming ahead with turnaround plans unveiled just two weeks ago.

Chief executive David Lockwood, who joined last year, said he was aiming to raise £400million from selling off various divisions that were less connected to its core work.

The FTSE250 company is a key contractor for the Ministry of Defence and is tasked with maintaining the UK's fleet of nuclear submarines, operating the Devonport naval dock at Plymouth and training Royal Air Force pilots.

The sale of Frazer-Nash Consultancy for £293million means Babcock has secured most of money it needs to meet its goal.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The economic and social divide between the North and the South of the UK has widened over the past three years and is continuing to grow, new data suggests.

Increases in household income, a decline in the rate of women claiming job seeker’s allowance, and rise in the proportion of ethnic minority workers employed in the region have all contributed to higher social and economic prosperity in the South.

However, the North has become less prosperous as a result of falling household incomes, fewer small businesses and lengthier journeys to get to work.

'Lifeblood of the UK economy': The report highlights the importance of small businesses to the local economy

This is according to Mastercard's new 'inclusive growth score' for the UK, which aims to draw a comprehensive economic and social picture of communities across the country.

It does so by analysing 21 different social and economic indicators - ranging from housing affordability and broadband speed to access to public green space, clean air as well as small business representation and commercial diversity.

And it shows that so far in 2021, the south of the UK has an average growth score of 54 out of 100, marking an improvement from a score of 53 in 2018.

But the North scores lower at 48, with the region's economic and social situation having worsened since three years ago, when the score was 49. The Midlands has a score of 51.

'This disparity between scores is evidence of inequality in social and economic prosperity between the regions and highlights the need to rebalance the country,' the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth said.

The data show the importance of diverse worker representation for communities' prosperity

The report highlights the importance of small businesses to the local economy, with micro and small businesses accounting for 50 per cent of total revenue generated by UK businesses and 44 per cent of the labour force.

Kelly Devine, president of UK & Ireland at Mastercard, said: 'Small businesses are the lifeblood of the UK economy and their success is crucial in driving sustainable, inclusive growth in communities.

'In the UK, Without small businesses, local communities would suffer from a lack of local employment opportunities and the government’s levelling up agenda would be impossible to achieve.'

She also said it was 'vital' that communities had diverse worker representation if they were to be 'truly inclusive'.

'This is key for post-pandemic economic recovery as it’s estimated that £24billion could be added to the UK economy if racial disparities in the labour market were addressed.'

Leeds, Manchester and Preston buck the northern trend...

While on average southern areas are more prosperous than northern regions, there are some cities in the north of England that have bucked the trend with better-than-average growth.

Leeds, for example, scored 55 this year, driven by increases in ethnic minority worker representation and overall community wellbeing.

Similarly, Manchester scored 53 in 2021 despite the economic challenges presented by the pandemic, with this down to increases in education accessibility and access to healthcare.

Manchester scored 53 in 2021 despite the economic challenges presented by the pandemic, with this down to increases in education accessibility and access to healthcare

Preston, a city in Lancashire known for the 'Preston model' of sustainable economic development and experimentation in 'community wealth building', also scored above the average at 53.

Andrew Western, Greater Manchester councillor for digital, work, skills and apprenticeships, said: 'In Greater Manchester we know social and economic inequalities are a significant barrier in helping us achieve our ambition that our city-region become one of the best places in the world to grow up, get on and grow old.

'The Mastercard Inclusive Growth Score is an important tool in aiding our understanding of what support is needed locally to nurture inclusive, economic, and social growth, helping us to drive improvements to make things better for our people across Greater Manchester.'

... While Bath, Canterbury and Exeter buck the southern trend

There are also some southern cities where the score is lagging behind the regional average, including Bath which scored 48, and Canterbury and Exeter which each scored 45.

In both Bath and Canterbury, the decline was due to decreases in public green space and accessibility of education, while Exeter saw prosperity decline as minority worker representation and small business both fell.

Devine said the findings could help policymakers and community leaders 'uncover and prioritise' areas where more support is needed.

'The range of indicators provide a comprehensive view of conditions in an area and help local policy makers make decisions that meet the specific needs of communities and residents through community projects, affordable housing, and investment in local businesses,' she added.

The report comes as the government recently reiterated its commitment to 'level up' the country, closing the gap between depressed areas of the UK, mostly in the north, and London and the south-east.

The data used is collected from publicly available sources such as Office for National Statistics and HM Land Registry, as well as from Mastercard.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@With beauty, talent and Hollywood success, Kate Beckinsale has led a life that most would consider to be charmed.

Yet the actress has long felt there was a piece of the puzzle still missing – which is why at the age of 48 she is considering making a return to Oxford University in order to complete the degree she abandoned as a young woman.

‘I took my kid to my college and my French tutor was still there,’ Kate said recently.

The kid she refers to is Lily, her 22-year-old daughter with actor Michael Sheen.

‘My tutor said, “You know you can come back any time?”’

The three years Kate spent at 14th Century New College have mostly been forgotten amid the glamour of her subsequent achievements, which include starring roles in the films Pearl Harbor and Serendipity.

Even at the time, it was assumed that her decision to leave Oxford in 1994, before her final year, was the result of conflict between her academic studies and an already blossoming acting career.

Kate was still at Oxford when Sir Kenneth Branagh made her a star by casting her in his film adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing.

‘It was getting to the point where I wasn’t enjoying either thing enough because both were very high-pressure,’ Kate has said in the past.

But there was another, darker reason for turning her back on Oxford, as she has now acknowledged. And it has cast a shadow over everyone involved.

With beauty, talent and Hollywood success, Kate Beckinsale has led a life that most would consider to be charmed. Yet the actress has long felt there was a piece of the puzzle still missing

Although fully occupied with acting and studying, Kate had found herself part of a high-flying social set whose hedonism echoed that of Brideshead Revisited’s Sebastian Flyte.

Privately educated and privileged, this group drank and took illegal drugs – until the gilded edifice came crashing down one night in 1992 with the traumatic death of one of Kate’s closest friends.

‘My friends were party people and I wasn’t,’ she recalled.

‘They’d all moved into a house and I stayed in the college, where I then got mono [mononucleosis, or glandular fever], and went home.

‘While I was home, one of my dear friends there ended up jumping out of a window and dying.

‘All my other friends were rusticated – basically expelled for a year and then you come back.

'When I was considering going back, nobody was there and there was this horrible whiff of death everywhere. That was the reason why I didn’t go back.’

Privately educated and privileged, Kate's group drank and took illegal drugs – until the gilded edifice came crashing down one night in 1992 (pictured, Kate in 1992)

That friend was Henry Skelton, a 21-year-old fine arts undergraduate, aspiring musician and artist, whose promise was cut short when he fell to his death from a second-floor college room after taking a cocktail of champagne, tequila and the hallucinogenic drug LSD.

The senseless death left the group shattered. Henry’s girlfriend, Dominique De Bastarrechea, and two of his friends were expelled for a year following the episode.

Judge’s daughter Georgia Gwynne-Griffiths was jailed for nine months for supplying drugs.

For Kate, the terrible incident had macabre echoes of an episode of Inspector Morse, the Oxford-based TV detective series directed by her stepfather Roy Battersby in 1991, in which a brilliant student dies during an exam.

It sealed her decision to focus on acting and put the now-tainted memories of Oxford firmly behind her.

That friend was Henry Skelton (pictured at matriculation at New College Oxford in 1991) who he fell to his death from a second-floor college room after taking a cocktail of champagne, tequila and the hallucinogenic drug LSD

By the time she arrived to study French and Russian literature in 1991, Kate had already experienced a degree of privilege, but sadness, too.

The daughter of two well-established actors, Richard Beckinsale and Judy Loe, she grew up in leafy Chiswick, West London, and attended the independent Godolphin and Latymer school for girls. Family friends included Vanessa Redgrave and director Ken Loach.

Of course, the defining event of her childhood was the premature death of her father, the much-loved star of Porridge and Rising Damp, at the age of 31.

Kate was just five at the time and ‘started expecting bad things to happen’. At 15, she suffered a breakdown and developed anorexia.

Her talent shone through, all the same. As a teenager, Kate won her first television part in an adaptation of P. D. James’s Devices And Desires detective novel, making her a minor celebrity among fellow students even by the time she had arrived to start her degree.

Television presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell, who was at Oxford at the same time, described Kate as ‘whip-clever, slightly nuts and very charming’.

More television parts followed at Oxford, as well as a role in a production of Arthur Miller’s A View From The Bridge, directed by future King’s Speech director Tom Hooper.

After splitting from her then partner Michael Sheen (pictured together, with Sarah Silverman), Beckinsale married director Len Wiseman and made a series of vampire films with him. The couple divorced in 2019

She met fellow actor Edmund Moriarty and fell in love, dating him for two years while she juggled acting and her studies. But some at the university were still notorious for bouts of debauchery at the time.

The Bullingdon Club, which at that point included George Osborne and Boris Johnson’s brother Jo, was in full, alcohol-fuelled swing.

It was only six years earlier that Olivia Channon, the daughter of Margaret Thatcher’s then Transport Secretary Paul Channon, had died in her sleep after taking heroin at a student party.

Kate’s friends at New College shared her artistic temperament, but while she devoted ever more energy to her burgeoning career, some in her circle began to experiment with drugs.

Among them was Henry Skelton, a shy and sensitive soul, who was not only a gifted artist but also a talented violinist. He had previously won a music scholarship to Marlborough College, the boarding school later attended by the Duchess of Cambridge.

Henry had struggled emotionally since his parents’ separation, however, and was needlessly racked with doubts about his abilities. In fact, he was regarded highly by his tutors. He was also worried about his relationship with his girlfriend Dominique. Then on the evening of December 1, 1992, Henry decided – disastrously – to take LSD for only the second time.

His first experience of the drug had been just the previous night and it hadn’t agreed with him. But in the company of his good friends, he tried again.

The drugs had been bought by Dominique and her American friend and fellow student, 20-year-old James Merino. They paid £10.50 for three ‘tabs’ of LSD, then returned to their rooms in New College Lane.

There, they were joined by Henry and fellow student Joel Roderick, 20. Together, they shared the drugs and a bottle of champagne, washing it down with tequila.

Fearful that Henry was feeling suicidal, the students, who were all in their second year, had tried to stay awake by talking to him but they later dozed off.

While they slept, Henry went into the neighbouring room.

By the time they woke up, it was too late. Henry had climbed through a 2ft-wide second-floor window and fallen 25ft head-first.

Shortly afterwards, James walked into the room to see the sash window open and his friend’s body lying on the ground below.

The trio alerted police and Henry was rushed to the intensive care unit at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital, but he died three hours later from multiple injuries.

At an inquest, James said he thought his friend might have committed suicide after he had admitted writing his own obituary two weeks earlier.

‘I was very surprised,’ he said. ‘It occurred to me that he might be about to commit suicide. I realised I had my key and went in. The room was empty and the sash window was pushed up.

‘It is based on my knowledge of him and him telling me about his obituary and things I have discovered since.

‘There were a lot of things he was depressed about. I know he felt very insecure about relationships and his artwork.’

However, Dominique believed that it was the LSD that had made him depressed.

‘It made him quite fatalistic in a way and I think he might have been thinking like that,’ she later said, adding that Henry had never talked about suicide and ‘seemed to enjoy life’.

The Oxfordshire coroner recorded an open verdict after pathologist Dr Ian Buley said Henry died from severe head injuries. Urine tests revealed he had taken ‘nine times an effective dose of LSD’.

The pathologist added that the drug is ‘known to promote or accentuate suicidal feelings’.

Henry’s death was a salutary lesson for his three friends, who were all sent down for a year after appearing before a university disciplinary committee.

It was devastating, too, for the woman who had sold the drugs.

Georgia Gwynne-Griffiths, the daughter of a leading QC, had already graduated with a 2:1 in Law from St Edmund Hall.

Now she was back at Oxford to do a business studies course and was having a ‘last crazy binge’, as she later put it, before starting her career.

She was in a lecture when police arrived to question her about 1.5oz of amphetamine found in her room and the tabs of LSD she had sold.

Pleading guilty to possessing the LSD and amphetamine sulphate with intent to supply, she was sentenced to nine months in jail. Her dreams of a legal career were crushed.

In an interview after being released from New Hall prison in Wakefield, she said: ‘As I was leaving the station, one of the policemen said, “By the way, you may like to know that last night a young man who took some of the acid you sold jumped to his death.”

‘As I took in those words, it was as though I was falling backwards: a young man dead and the finger of guilt pointing at me. Outside the station it was pitch-black and pouring with rain. I don’t know why, but I started running with tears streaming down my face.

‘For the first time in my life there was nothing I could do to take away what was happening.

‘No one could help me – not my parents, not anyone. I was completely on my own. A man had died and I was apparently involved in some way. From that day my life became hell.’

After Henry’s death, Oxford pledged to clamp down on drug use at the university. A survey revealed that 40 per cent of students there had taken illegal substances.

The university also promised to improve student welfare after a report revealed that undergraduate suicide had become a ‘cause for concern’ and recommended improvements in official counselling services.

Kate Beckinsale, meanwhile, was safely at home, recuperating from her bout of glandular fever.

A few months later she flew to Tuscany to film Branagh’s Much Ado About Nothing.

When Kate attended the film’s premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in Doc Martens, she was hailed for her sweetness and natural beauty, while her perfectly judged performance also marked her out as a major new talent.

As a foreign language student, Kate spent her third year – 1993-94 – studying in Paris, where she appeared in the French language film Marie-Louise Ou La Permission. But when it came time to return for her fourth and final year, the loss of her friend made the idea of returning to New College unbearable. She never went back.

Shortly afterwards, she confirmed her status as a rising star with the role of Flora Poste in the film Cold Comfort Farm.

Kate would go from strength to strength, graduating from appearing in smaller British films to Hollywood blockbusters.

After splitting from her then partner Michael Sheen, she married director Len Wiseman and made a series of vampire films with him. The couple divorced in 2019.

Since then, she has been linked to a string of younger men, including American comedian Pete Davidson.

Now, it seems, she may finally be ready to return to Oxford, lay to rest the memory of her friend’s tragic death and finish the degree she began all those years ago.

And, as she said recently, contemplating her decision to leave: ‘I remember, at the time, thinking, “It’s such a shame university is at this time of your life when you’re thinking, Who should I get off with and am I a lesbian and what posters do I want on my wall?”

‘Wouldn’t it be better, once you’ve actually lived a bit, to go, “I really like this”?’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Young children have higher odds of spreading COVID-19 in their households than teenagers, a new study suggests.

Researchers found that youngsters under the age of three were 1.4 times more likely to infect household members than those between ages 14 and 17.

What's more, younger children were more likely to transmit the virus to people between ages 20 and 40 while older children infected others between ages 40 and 60.

The team, from Public Health Ontario, in Canada, says the findings suggest that - although children do not infect others as frequently as adults do - parents and guardians should wear masks while caring for sick children at home and that the infected kid should be separated from their siblings until their illness clears up.

A new study found 30.5% of children below age three infected with COVID-19 passed the virus to people within the household compared to 26.7% of COVID-19-infected teens aged 14 to 17. Pictured: A health worker collects a swab sample from a child to test for COVID-19 in Tel Aviv, Israel, August 9

Younger children were more likely to transmit the virus to people between ages 20 and 40 while older children infected others between ages 40 and 60 (above)

Early in the pandemic, when lockdowns and stay-at-home orders were implemented, testing strategies focused on healthcare workers and those with Covid symptoms.

This resulted in fewer children being diagnosed and very little study of the role of children in transmitting the virus.

For the new study, published in JAMA Network Open, the team looked at data from public health units from more than 6,200 households with a child who had tested positive for COVID-19 between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020.

Children were split into four age groups: ages zero to three, ages four to eight, ages nine to 13 and ages 14 to 17.

Of the households with a pediatric Covid case, 27.3 percent, or about 1,700, had secondary cases of the virus, with a median of about two cases.

Researchers found that this corresponds with a transmission rate of 27,341 per 100000 households with child cases.

Next, the team looked at this rate when broken down by age group.

Of the 766 cases among children between ages zero and three, 234, or 30.5 percent, were linked to a secondary cases within the household

Comparatively, among those between ages 14 and 17, 636 of 2,376 cases led to secondary transmission, or 26.7 percent

This means the crude rate of transmission for toddlers to household members is 30,548 per 100,000 and for teenagers is 26,768 per 100,000 - making young children 1.2 times more likely to spread Covid.

After adjusting for delays in testing and average family size, the model found that younger kids were 1.43 times more likely to transmit the virus to household members.

There were no differences found in COVID-19 spread when it came to gender, the month in which the virus was detected or whether or not the person had symptoms.

Additionally, younger children were more likely to transmit the virus to people between ages 20 and 40 while older children infected others between ages 40 and 60 - likely because younger adults are more likely to be the parents of toddlers and older adults are more likely to be the parents of teenagers.

The researchers believe the younger children are more infectious because they carry higher levels of the virus in their noses and throats than older children.

What's more, because younger children are more likely to be asymptomatic, they are less likely to be tested, leading to them interacting with more people and resulting in viral spread.

'We found that younger children may be more likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with older children,' the authors wrote.

'Although children do not appear to transmit infection as frequently as adults, caregivers should be aware of the risk of transmission while caring for sick children in the household setting.

'As it is challenging and often impossible to socially isolate from sick children, caregivers should apply other infection control measures where feasible, such as use of masks, increased hand washing, and separation from siblings.'

In the snap, her daughter could be seen holding up a roll of ultrasound snaps while standing between her mum and dad.

Dani wrote: 'Han Solo had Chewie. Frodo had Sam. Shrek had Donkey.

'Now be prepared for the adventures of Avarie-Belle and as of yet unnamed bump, coming February 2022.'

Simon shared the same photo and caption, but added: '(hopefully not to a cinema near you).'

Then and now: Dani began playing the iconic role of Tracy Beaker in 2002 when she was just 12-years-old

Family: Dani and Simon Brough are already doting parents to daughter Avarie-Belle, five

Exciting! Simon added an extra line to the pregnancy announcement

Dani's celebrity pals were quick to congratulate the star in the comments section beneath the sweet photograph.

Dani recently reprised her role as the former tearaway teen Tracy Beaker in a reboot of the much-loved series based on Jacqueline Wilson's 2018 book.

In February, Dani appeared on The One Show, where she explained how playing Tracy Beaker once more is 'really nice' especially because her character has 'lost her selfishness' as a teen and is now a dedicated mother to daughter Jess, played by Emma Maggie Davies,.

She admitted: 'Being a mother myself, it completely changes you. So it's been really nice to play Tracy and see how she's lost that selfishness that she once has and she's all just about Jess.

Dani began playing the iconic role of Tracy Beaker in 2002 when she was just 12-years-old.

And the former Strictly star reminisced about growing up famous, and noted how at one point, she didn't want to be known as Tracy Beaker after being constantly called by her alter-ego's name.

She said 'When I was younger, I used to get called Tracy a lot more than I got called Dani. At one point I was like "oh, can I just not be Tracy, just for a minute!".
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Prince Harry will visit the UK 'with a camera crew in tow' later this year to film his new Netflix documentary about the Invictus Games, a royal expert has claimed.

The Duke of Sussex, 36, who is currently living in his $14 million mansion in Santa Barbara, announced earlier this year he is making a series for the streaming service which will follow competitors around the world training for the Games at The Hague called Heart of Invictus.

And sources have now revealed Prince Harry is due to return to the UK for the documentary in November to visit an army base before meeting the Queen, 95, telling the Express: 'Our understanding is that the Duke of Sussex will be accompanied by a small film crew in order to allow the public to see the hard work involved in planning these games.'

Speaking of the filming with Christine Lampard on today's Lorraine, royal expert Russell Myers said: 'Imagine him popping up outside Buckingham Palace with a camera crew? Will we see Harry back with a camera crew in tow outside the palace? You never know. Nothing is off limits with Harry.'

Prince Harry could arrive at Buckingham Palace 'with a camera crew in tow' for his new Netflix documentary about the Invictus Games, a royal expert has claimed

It has been reported Prince Harry would fly from California to the UK to film the upcoming documentary.

Sources said he would take a film crew employed by Archewell Productions to visit participants at Stanford Hall, the Army's rehabilitation centre for wounded soldiers.

He will then pay a visit to his grandmother, the Queen, before flying back to his home in California.

Appearing on Lorraine today, Russell said: 'He's obviously signed a big money deal with Netflix.

The Duke of Sussex, 36, who is currently living in his $14 million mansion in Santa Barbara, announced earlier this year he is making a series for the streaming service which will follow competitors around the world training for the Games at The Hague called Heart of Invictus

'One of these documentary ideas that he came up with was having a camera crew create a documentary about the Invictus Games, the fantastic sports event which he created in 2013 which have gone on to be a huge success.'

'It's a fantastic initiative for injured servicemen and women of getting out with the power of sports and a global phenomenon.

'So, will we see Harry back with a camera crew in tow outside the palace? You never know. Nothing is off limits with Harry.'

The documentary Heart of Invictus is part of a £100m deal struck with streaming giant Netflix last year.

Speaking on today's Lorraine, expert Russell Myers joked 'nothing was off limits' when it came to Prince Harry

It will be directed by a British documentary Orlando von Einsiedel, whose team won an Academy Award for their short film The White Helmets and a BAFTA for Virunga, another documentary, set in the Congo's Virunga national park.

A source said: 'The Duke of Sussex will want to make sure we are ready as the last games were cancelled because of Covid.

'We are hoping that the situation in April next year allows the games to go ahead as planned, in Holland. '

The Duke who will appear on camera and be an executive producer, has been living in Montecito, California, with his wife Meghan since last summer after they both quit as senior royals.

Netflix said the couple would be producing 'content that informs but also gives hope,' from documentaries and scripted series, to features and children's programming.

While it was reported Prince Harry could pay his grandmother the Queen a visit in between filming for the documentary, it is not known whether he'll do the same for his brother William, pictured with him and Prince Charles in 2014

Talking about the new show today, Harry said: 'Since the very first Invictus Games back in 2014, we knew that each competitor would contribute in their own exceptional way to a mosaic of resilience, determination, and resolve.

'This series will give communities around the world a window into the moving and uplifting stories of these competitors on their path to the Netherlands next year.

'As Archewell Productions' first series with Netflix, in partnership with the Invictus Games Foundation, I couldn't be more excited for the journey ahead or prouder of the Invictus community for continuously inspiring global healing, human potential and continued service.'

Heart of Invictus, will be directed by Orlando von Einsiedel and produced by Joanna Natasegara, who previously worked on Oscar-winning short The White Helmets together.

Harry will appear in the show and will serve as executive producer on the series.

Sources said the Duke will pay a visit to the Queen in November before flying back to his home in California (pictured with the Duchess in 2018)

Harry previously explained the Netflix and Spotify deals in the Oprah interview by saying: 'My family literally cut me off financially, and I had to afford security for us.'

Dominic Reid, chief executive of the Invictus Games Foundation, said: 'We're very excited about the opportunity to shine the global spotlight of Netflix on the men and women that we work with, in order to ensure that even more people can be inspired by their determination and fortitude in working towards their recovery.

'This partnership will also bring in significant funding to the charity. We are extremely grateful to our Founding Patron for his continued efforts to support the military community, and for making this partnership happen.'

The Invictus Games is a bi-annual sporting event created by Prince Harry for injured military personnel.

Founded in 2014, the sporting event sees wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and veterans compete in nine sports.

These include wheelchair basketball, sitting volleyball, and indoor rowing.

Prince Harry is patron of the games, named after Invictus, Latin for 'undefeated'.

Unfortunately the 2020 event, which was postponed due to Covid, has been delayed yet again.

Olly was seen wearing a leg brace for the performance and said that he was trying to 'take it easy' before being pelted with the item.

However, he put on a brave face and concluded: 'The gig was amazing. To be honest with you, it felt better than I thought. I was trying to be a bit cautious on stage.'

Olly nevertheless admitted he didn't appreciate the sunscreen being thrown at him as he said on Instagram Live after the show: 'The suncream was not a good idea half way through the gig.

'Thanks to the person who threw it at me, my eyes are still stinging from that.'

'During the gig, I was just limping the whole time, I couldn't believe it. So basically I'm in, I've had the surgery, I wanted to get this done because I've got the Newby gig on the 14th and the Singleton Park on the 15th.

'So I wanted to make sure I got this done for you guys. It will be a different gig, I probably won't be running around like I normally do, there might be a stool for me to sit down on, but I can't cancel these gigs for you guys.

'It was such an amazing vibe on Friday at Newmarket so I'll give it absolutely everything next week for you all.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Buried beneath the Jadar River valley in rural Serbia is a mineral which bears an uncanny resemblance to kryptonite, the fictional green crystal which saps Superman's powers.

More than a decade ago, a mineralogist at the Natural History Museum in London was asked by baffled Rio Tinto geologists to analyse this strange substance they had dug up a few years earlier near the Bosnian border.

Much to the delight of Rio's PR team, Dr Chris Stanley discovered the chemical compound – sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide – matched the description of kryptonite used by Superman's nemesis Lex Luthor in the 2006 film Superman Returns.

Going green: The chemical compound of Jadarite (right) matches the description of Kryptonite by Superman's nemesis Lex Luther

The big difference – apart from not being the stuff of comic book capers – is that this mineral is white and was contained in lumps of grey rock.

It is called jadarite and it looks set to be the next big money-spinner for Rio Tinto, which is racing to cash in on the global electric car revolution as internal combustion engines are replaced by batteries.

Rio discovered jadarite back in 2004 and has placed a £1.7billion bet on mining the little-known substance.

Jadarite, which Rio named after the Jadar valley in western Serbia, is a unique high-grade mineral compound of lithium and borates which has not been found anywhere else in the world.

Borates are crystallised salts that contain boron, which is used in fertilisers and heat resistant glass for smartphones, as well as materials for wind farms and solar panels.

Lithium, of course, is a key component in lithium-ion electric car batteries.

For the last few years Rio's scientists in a laboratory in the suburbs or Melbourne, Australia, have been trying to figure out how to process this compound to produce lithium and borates economically and at scale.

Having 'cracked the code', according to Rio, all that is now needed is a mine to dig it out of the ground.

The miner has already committed £1.7billion to a site near the Jadar river, which it says is set to become Europe's biggest supplier of lithium for at least the next 15 years.

It is currently waiting for approval from the Serbian government to start building, and is busy negotiating with a local farmer to buy a couple of hundred fields stretching across the 400-hectare site.

Jadarite - which mining giant Rio Tinto discovered in Siberia, bears many similarities to kryptonite, the fictional green crystal which saps Superman's powers

But if everything goes to plan it hopes to start construction next year, and production by 2026. Once operational, Rio believes it will be able to dig up 58,000 tons of jadarite a year, which will be enough for about 1m electric car batteries.

Overseeing the project from Brisbane is Sinead Kaufman, who hails from the home of Waterford Crystal in south-east Ireland and studied geology at Birmingham University before moving to Perth with Rio 16 years ago.

Kaufman, who runs Rio's minerals empire spanning diamonds to salt, is flying to Serbia on Saturday to see the site for the first time.

She said: 'Jadarite is amazing as it was actually found by Rio Tinto's geologists back in 2004. When they found it, they had no idea what it was as nobody had ever seen it before – it's a unique mineral.

'It looks like a grey rock with a bunch of white spots on it but each of those white spots is something quite special.'

Mining, oil and gas giants have all been busy burnishing their environmental credentials, amid growing pressure from politicians, environmental groups and big investors to tackle climate change and switch away from traditional fossil fuels to greener technologies.

While it is crucial they do their bit to hit net-zero carbon emissions targets, there is also a huge amount of money to be made.

Kaufman said demand for lithium is expected to grow by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent a year over the next decade, as diesel and petrol cars are phased out around the world.

Last month BHP signed a lucrative deal with Tesla boss Elon Musk (pictured) to supply nickel from its Kwinana refinery south of Perth, in Australia

'Lithium is really essential for the transition the world makes to a low carbon economy,' she said. 'It's something we know the world will need over the next few decades.

'You just can't produce the vision the world has for the electrification of cars if you don't have the material to make those batteries.'

But Rio is playing catch-up. Rival BHP has been mining another key component in lithium-ion electric car batteries – nickel – for years.

Last month BHP signed a lucrative deal with Elon Musk to supply nickel from its Kwinana refinery south of Perth, in Australia.

The silvery white metallic element is used to pack more energy into batteries and allows producers to reduce the use of cobalt, which is more expensive.

Nickel is also scarce and Musk has promised a 'giant contract for a long period of time' for a miner who can extract it while also causing minimal damage to the environment.

At the annual 'Diggers and Dealers' mining conference in Kalgoorlie, Australia, last week, BHP announced plans to build new nickel mines and wind farms in Western Australia as it tries to accelerate away from the fossil fuel sector.

But shortly before mining bosses showed off their green credentials there was a timely reminder that the battery technology remains in its infancy.

Firefighters had just spent the weekend trying to extinguish a blaze at Tesla's 'Big Battery', near Geelong in Victoria.

This is the largest lithium-ion battery in Australia and was built to provide electricity to the national grid. As it was far too dangerous to spray water on a 13-ton battery, the 150 firefighters had to let it burn for three days, sending big plumes of toxic smoke into the air.

Investigators will now try to determine precisely what caused the blaze.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Share trading and investing has surged in popularity in the pandemic, with a new breed of younger investors emerging who are increasingly attracted to big name US shares.

But there's a hurdle for some: if you want to buy a single Amazon share it will cost you $3,342, about £2,400 for a UK investor, while just one Tesla share costs $713, and even a lower-priced individual Apple share costs $146.

DIY investing giant Hargreaves Lansdown revealed yesterday that it has seen a surge in younger investors, but the past 18 months has also seen business boom for upstart rival trading apps and platforms, such as Freetrade, Trading 212 and eToro.

An attractive part of the latter's offering compared to the DIY investing platform old guard is the chance for investors to snap up fractional shares: a way to back stock market juggernauts for a fraction of the cost of one share.

Investors can get a slice of expensive tech companies like Amazon, which has a share price of $3,342, or about £2,400, through fractional share trading

What is a fractional share?

Fractional share investing lets investors own a piece of a share rather than one or more whole individual stocks.

Shares trade on the stock market as whole, rather than a portion, so the way to buy or sell fractionally is through a broker, DIY investing platform or app that offers this, and not all do.

Those that do offer fractional shares enable investors to more easily invest in leading stocks with big ticket share prices like Amazon.

The advantage is that these may otherwise be out of the reach of smaller investors, or require too big a chunk of an individual's portfolio for it to remain diversified.

For example, even for someone with a £20,000 investment portfolio, holding just one $3,342 Amazon share would equate to about £2,400 - more than 10 per cent of their holdings.

How do I invest in fractional shares?

Fractional shares do not trade on the open market so investors will need to sign up to a trading platform that offers them.

The most popular platforms for fractional share ownership in the UK are eToro, Trading212 and Freetrade, which all charge zero commission on trades so fees don't eat into returns.

In contrast, the big gun DIY investing platforms Hargreaves Lansdown, Interactive Investor, AJ Bell and Fidelity don't offer fractional share ownership but do tend to have deeper investing options in terms of funds, investment trusts and ETFs.

Investors can invest in fractional and whole shares, so they could put part of their portfolio in a fraction of a share in a company with a big share price like Amazon and the rest in cheaper stocks that would allow them to buy full shares.

It gives retail investors the opportunity to have a slice of such companies, while simultaneously diversifying their portfolio.

The problem is more acute for investors in big US stock market names, particularly the tech giants, where individual share prices tend to be higher. UK fractional shares aren't as common, partly because there aren't as many bumper share price stocks listed on the London stock exchange as in the US.

How else are fractional shares created?

Investors can also own fractional shares without setting out to invest in them specifically.

This can happen through dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), stock splits and through mergers and acquisitions.

A DRIP is when a dividend-offering company or brokerage firm allows investors to use dividend payouts to purchase more of the same shares.

Because it 'drips' back into the purchase of more shares it is not limited to full shares.

A 3 for 2 stock split would create three stocks for every two an investor owns, so an investor with an odd number of shares would end up with a fractional share.

Finally, M&As may also create fractional shares if companies combine new common stock using a predetermined ratio.

TRADING PLATFORMS THAT OFFER FRACTIONAL SHARES IN THE UK eToro - $50 minimum deposit Wombat - £10 minimum deposit Trading212 - $1/€1 minimum deposit Freetrade - requires £5 minimum deposit to open an account Revolut - $1 minimum deposit. The minimum amount of shares you can buy is 0.00000001. Stake - $50 minimum deposit Nutmeg and Wealthsimple also offer investors the opportunity to buy fractional shares through ETFs.

Will I get my dividends?

If you opt for fractional shares in a company that pays dividends you will still be entitled to a portion of the payouts.

The dividends are calculated based on the portion of a share the investor owns.

If a company pays its shareholders £5 in dividends per share and an investor owns half a share, they will be entitled to £2.50.

Are fractional shares worth investing in?

Fractional share investing is a good option for investors with limited funds, or those new to investing, who would otherwise be priced out of buying shares in popular stocks.

Even for some investors with larger portfolios, it makes sense for diversification purposes.

They can also simplify the way people invest: it allows investors to allocate a sum of cash to a given company rather than try to fit a company's share price to the amount of cash you want to invest.

The question is more whether it is worth seeking out a platform that offers fractional share investing over one that doesn't. Ultimately, that will depend on your investing style and preferences - for example, if you mainly hold UK shares it is less of an issue, but if you plan to directly hold big US stocks it might be worth doing.

Many of the new trading apps also do not offer fund investing and some may not have either an Isa or a Self invested personal pension option, meaning that overall one of the more established DIY investing platforms with a wider offering may prove better. You can read our guide to DIY investing platforms here.

David Kimberley, analyst at Freetrade said: 'Fractional shares allow investors to get started with as little as £2.

'In order to grow your money, it's important that investors prioritise time in the market, rather than trying to time the market.

'With fractional shares, you have the ability to invest smaller sums across a number of companies immediately, meaning that investors can start putting their hard-earned money to work, rather than saving up over months (or years) to buy a single share of a company like Alphabet.'

However, fractional shares may prove harder to transfer to a new provider or sell and if investors don't opt for zero commission platforms, they can rack up fees that eat into returns.

Lamborghini's iconic Countach - recently voted Britain's most popular poster car of all time - is making a comeback, the Italian marque has confirmed. And it looks set to be unveiled in a matter of days.

In a shock announcement, the iconic Italian sports car maker revealed via its social media channels that the Countach - first revealed in prototype form 50 years ago - will return in 2021.

Accompanying a teaser video to announce the news, the brand said: 'We make dreams come true. We did it with the classic Countach in the 1970s. And we're doing it again. The new Lamborghini Countach is coming.'

While details about the car and its unveiling are incredibly limited for now, the reborn Countach is expected to be debuted ahead of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California, which takes place on Sunday 15 August.

Countach is back! Lamborghini has revealed this teaser image of the reborn supercar, which looks set to be unveiled in full in the US next week

We make dreams come true. We did it with the classic Countach in the 1970s. And we’re doing it again. The new Lamborghini Countach is coming. ​#Lamborghini #Countach pic.twitter.com/nXctgIuyqe — Lamborghini (@Lamborghini) August 9, 2021

The original Countach debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971 as the LP500 concept, though it took another three years of development before the production version went on sale in 1974.

Still recognised as one of the greatest supercars of all time, the Countach's wedge-shaped design - penned by Marcello Gandini - and scissor doors were a huge departure from Lamborghini's original high-performance model, the Miura.

Earlier this year, returning chief executive Stefan Winkelmann promised two new models to feature the manufacturer's V12 engine before it embarked on electrifying its entire line-up, with the Countach set to be one of those cars to be among the last to get the wailing powerplant.

It's widely expected that it will share a powerplant with the hybrid Sián hypercar, using the 6.5-litre 12-cylinder motor and supercapacitor technology.

In a shock announcement on Monday night, Lamborghini confirmed the Countach nameplate will return in 2021 to mark the 50th anniversary of the original (pictured)

The return of the icon comes 50 years after the LP500 concept (pictured) was revealed at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show

The Countach went into production three years after the concept was showcased by Lamborghini. It was built from 1974 to 1990

Fewer than 2,000 examples of the original Countach were made despite it being in production for 16 years

It is unique from a traditional hybrid vehicle with a supplementary battery, being an electrical component that stores energy that can be used to boost both performance and efficiency.

With this being the case, be ready for the 2021 Countach to have somewhere in the region of 800PS (789 horsepower), accelerate from zero to 62mph in less than three seconds and have a top speed that nudges 220mph.

Further details about the car have been revealed on Instagram, having been leaked from the Lamborghini Unica app, which is exclusively reserved for customers who have at least one Lambo in their collection.

It's widely expected that the new Countach will share a powerplant with the hybrid Sián hypercar revealed in 2019. That means a 6.5-litre V12 with supercapacitor technology

The Contach is still recognised today as one of the greatest supercars of all time. Its looks were revolutionary when it went on sale in 1974

A wedge-shaped design - penned by Marcello Gandini - and scissor doors were a huge departure from Lamborghini's original high-performance model, the Miura

Earlier this year, returning Lamborghini CEO Stefan Winkelmann promised two new models that will feature the manufacturer's wailing V12 engine, with the Countach set to be one of those cars. Pictured, an original version of the supercar

Reports suggest its full name will be Countach LPI 800-4.

'LPI' is short for 'Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido', which loosely translates to it having a longitudinally mounted engine positioned in the middle - though towards the rear - of the car with a hybrid system. The '800' figure denotes the power output and '4' refers to it being all-wheel drive.

In terms of the looks, one snap showing the car under cover suggests it will be a true homage to the straight-lined and supremely low design of the original.

The one picture of the new car under cover suggests the it will stay true to the first examples, meaning no enormous rear wing like the version to the far right

Scissor doors, which open upwards and forwards, are almost certainly set to return also, given that the Countach was the first model to debut the then bonkers feature in the seventies

More details of the new version of this Lamborghini classic have been leaked online, with the car's full name set to be Countach LPI 800-4

LPI' is short for 'Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido', which loosely translates to it having a longitudinally mounted engine positioned in the middle - though towards the rear - of the car with a hybrid system. Pictured, two original Countach examples

While the lone images gives little away, it does show a long body with short rear overhangs and a distinctive silouhette that has graced the walls of petrolheads through generations (read more about that further down this page).

It also suggests the new model will stay true to the first examples, meaning no enormous rear wing.

Scissor doors, which open upwards and forwards, are almost certainly set to return also, given that the Countach was the first model to debut the then bonkers feature.

And while the Countach was in production for 16 years with just shy of 2,000 examples built, the new version to mark its 50th anniversary is going to be sold in far limited numbers and is certainly not going to be a complete one-off vehicle.

The '800' figure in the new version's name is said to denote the power output (800PS) and '4' refers to it being all-wheel drive. Pictured, four original Countach examples

The 2021 tribute to this iconic classic is set to be showcased at the ultra-exclusive Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, which is part of the Monterey Car Week event in the US

Pebble Beach has been the destination for Lamborghini to unveil limited-edition hypercars in the past, so is the most likely destination for the covers to come off the new take on this 50-year-old icon

While fewer than 2,000 versions of the original Countach (pictured) were make, production of the 2021 car will be in much smaller volumes

More will be revealed soon, likely towards the end of Monterey Car Week in the US (5 August - 15 August).

The Munich motor show is due to take place next month but Lamborghini has used the exclusive Pebble Beach event to showcase its limited-run hypercars in the past.

As well as promising two new new V12 models, the Italian marque also confirmed earlier this year that it will have an entirely electrified car range by 2024.

The new Countach won't be a one-off special, though its limited production run will most certainly be offered to its most committed customers who already have one or two Lamborghinis in their collection

In its traser announcement, the brand said: 'We make dreams come true. We did it with the classic Countach in the 1970s. And we're doing it again. The new Lamborghini Countach is coming'

The Countach name was the first not to be associated with famous bulls and bullfighting. The name originated from the word 'contacc', an exclamation of astonishment in the Piedmontese language

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A record number of second-hand cars were purchased in the UK between April and June, according to new industry figures published this morning.

Demand for used motors is at an all-time high due to a combination of pent-up demand following the pandemic and - more notably - the significant drop in new car supplies as a result of the global semiconductor computer chip shortage.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the used car market grew 108.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2021, with more than 2.1 million motors changing hands.

However, those buying second-hand cars are paying a premium as a result of the recent huge surge in demand with average values up 14 per cent year-on-year, according to Auto Trader.

Used car sales at record levels: The bottleneck in deliveries of new models caused by the global computer chip shortage has seen demand for second-hand vehicles surge in the second quarter of 2021

People buying used VWs, like the popular Golf hatchback pictured, face paying more money than a year ago with a 7.7% average price increase from the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter

Average prices of Smart's diminutive city cars have risen by around £900 in the last three months

Those looking for more luxury have seen used prices of a Mercedes Benz increase by more than 6% on average in the last three months alone

Industry data shows that a total of 2,167,504 used cars were bought in the months of April, May and June - up 6.6 per cent on 2019 pre-pandemic levels and the best second quarter performance on record.

In fact, bosses confirmed it was the second highest quarterly performance for used car sales ever, falling just 1,095 transactions shy of the 2020 third quarter high of 2,168,599, which was artificially inflated by the fact showrooms had been forced to close for much of the first half of that year due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The SMMT said the spike in sales was due to a combination of the country’s gradual emergence from lockdown and stock shortages in the new car market.

Latest registrations statistics published a week ago show that new motor sales plunged to their lowest July level since 1998, with deliveries bottlenecked by the global chip shortage.

This has forced many consumers to instead turn to used models to replace their existing vehicles, with April sales alone up 307.4 per cent on 2020 (and 5 per cent up on 2019) with 724,743 transactions in the month.

May and June also posted sales increases of 9.9 per cent and 4.6 per cent on pre-pandemic levels respectively, which were the best performances for both months ever seen.

It means that used car transactions for the first half of 2021 are up by a third (33.3 per cent) year-on-year to 3,855,259 units.

However, the lockdown during the first three months means second-hand sales are still 4.9 per cent down on half-year 2019 levels.

Considering a used Volvo? Experts suggest you'll have to pay 6.1% more on average today than you did in January, February and March this year

Even bargain hunters seeking a budged Dacia have seen the average price increase from £9,404.02 to £9,917.30 between Q1 and Q2 this year

With increased demand comes higher prices

With second-hand vehicle interest and sales at near record levels, so are prices of used motors.

With buyers growing increasingly frustrated with long waiting times and delivery delays for new models, many have turned their attention to used cars.

Ian Plummer, commercial director, Auto Trader, says the used car market is benefitting from a ‘multitude of tailwinds’ and, as a result, has revised predictions for used car sales in 2021, estimating eight million will change hands this year.

'Coupled with used car supply challenges, this demand has sent used prices rocketing, up from an already significant 7.1 per cent year-on-year increase in April to 11.1 per cent in June. This steep trajectory has continued, and as of July, prices are tracking at over 14 per cent,' he explained.

'With none of these consumer or economic factors showing any sign of easing, we’ve revised our 2021 forecast.

'We predict circa eight million used cars will be sold this year, which is considerably more robust than those made by other commentators, but we believe more accurately reflect the exceptional health of the market.'

Online automotive marketplace Heycar says it has seen the average price of a used VW rise by 8% in just one month as more drivers turn to the second-hand market

CAR BRANDS THAT ROSE IN VALUE MOST ON AVERAGE FROM Q1-Q2 2021 2021-Q1 2021-Q2 2021-Q2 MAKE Avg Price Avg Price % change Volkswagen £19,525.15 £21,032.15 7.7% Smart £10,125.51 £10,807.87 6.7% Mercedes-Benz £27,120.33 £28,861.03 6.4% Volvo £28,056.35 £29,754.21 6.1% Dacia £9,404.02 £9,917.30 5.5% SEAT £15,590.73 £16,386.99 5.1% Jaguar £33,563.86 £35,106.14 4.6% Audi £25,726.82 £26,870.24 4.4% Toyota £15,245.38 £15,911.24 4.4% Nissan £14,309.58 £14,838.80 3.7% Source: Heycar

Rival online car sales site heycar claims it has tracked average values of Volkswagens sold via its website increasing most between Q1 and Q2 as more buyers switch attention to the used market.

Karen Hilton, chief commercial officer said she has not been surprised to see that more people are keen to cash in on this spell of increased buying power.

'At heycar, we have seen a surge in part exchanges - jumping from around five per cent of our activity to 40 per cent in the space of a fortnight, she said.

'Motorists are clearly trading up, too - our dealer partners are telling us that people who do part exchange spend an extra £13,000 on their next car, on average.

'In this general period of market strength, certain manufacturers are more in demand. So, between Q1 and Q2, we have seen Ford models rise by 3.6 per cent, Nissans by 3.7 per cent and Volkswagens by 7.7 per cent.'

Online used car marketplace BuyaCar also recently claimed it had seen values 'shoot up to an unprecedented level' it calls 'new record prices' in recent weeks, with evidence of drivers paying more on average than ever before to secure a second-hand motor.

This increasingly strangled supply of new cars has seen the average price of a used models sold on its website rise from £13,108 in January to an all-time high of £15,399 in May - with prices continue to rise since.

It also claims that the average price of its top five best-selling cars broke the £17,000 barrier for the first time since the website launched in 2002.

SMMT stats show there's been an increase in sales of older used cars with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold in April to June being three years or under, the lowest on record

Commenting on the spike in second-hand motor demand, Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said, 'This is welcome news for the used car market as transactions rebounded following nationwide lockdowns which closed retailers.

'More motorists are turning to used cars as supply shortages continue to affect the new car market, and the increased need for personal mobility with people remaining wary of public transport as they return to work.

'A buoyant used car market is necessary to maintain strong residual values which, in turn, supports new car transactions.

'We now need to see a similar rebound in new car sales to accelerate the fleet renewal necessary to deliver immediate and continuous improvements in air quality and carbon emissions.'

Demand for used battery electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicles tripled in the second quarter to 10,903 and 16,202 - up 353.9 per cent and 349.8 per cent respectively.

However, these plug-in cars represent just 1.3 per cent of all second-hand vehicle transactions as older versions of electrified vehicles are slowly entering the used market.

Petrol and diesel powertrains, meanwhile, made up 96.4 per cent of the quarter’s used car market at 2,090,396 units.

In addition, increased demand overall has led to an increase in sales of older used cars with only 12.7 per cent of all vehicles sold being three years or under, the lowest on record.

Ford's Fiesta was the most-bought used car in the second quarter of 2021, while black was the most popular vehicle colour to change hands.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Tens of thousands of video clips and images have been sent to police showing motorists driving carelessly, dangerously and against the law in the last three years, latest figures show.

Since the National Dash Cam Safety Portal was created in summer 2018, a total of 68,279 pieces of footage and photos have been uploaded as part of 32,905 unique public submissions by drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians who have informed on road users putting others at risk.

It says 2021 has been the busiest so far with 19,565 videos uploaded to the platform in the first half of the year and a 341 per cent increase on average in the months of April to June.

Law Breakers: The National Dash Cam Safety Portal has in 3 years received 68,279 pieces of footage and photos since its inception in the summer of 2018

The NDCSP is now in its third year of operation with 37 of the 45 UK police forces currently signed up to use it - and more in talks to join.

The database - created by dashcam manufacturer Nextbase and security software specialist, Egress - provides a simple online portal for any member of the public to send images and videos of other drivers being reckless at the wheel.

With police numbers being cut in the last decade, the portal has provided a simple way for people to submit evidence to the police, which is then reviewed by officers to deem if the footage shows actions that are offence worthy.

The surge in use of dashcams, with motorists and cyclists using cameras for insurance and claims purposes, and smartphones means people have been capturing clips of poor driving in increasing numbers.

Motoring groups have previously said that it has become a 'sad state of affairs' that dwindling police numbers has meant that 'dash cam vigilantes' are now required to enforce the nation's road safety.

Any images and video taken by the public can be sent to police via the portal and can be used to prosecute dangerous drivers in the same way speed camera clips are used as the sole evidence needed to punish limit-breaking motorists.

Some 19,565 videos have been uploaded to the platform in the first half of the year and a 341% increase on average in the months of April to June

Each video requires a short description of the event captured, additional photos and a supporting online questionnaire, which takes around 15 minutes to complete in total.

This can be used as an eye-witness statement if police proceed with punishing a driver caught on camera.

Nextbase says the the database has saved police a collective 263,240 hours - the equivalent of over 29 years of officers' time - in the three years it has been in use.

It says 2021 has so far proven to be the system’s busiest time yet.

As lockdown restrictions began to ease in April, with beer gardens opening and the number of people beginning to go on staycations across the country increased, some 19,565 submissions have been made so far this year.

In the months of April to June, the portal saw 5,457 road traffic offences punished - which is more than double the three-month average since the portal’s inception.

These penalties can range from court cases to awareness courses, or fixed penalty notices to warning letters.

All public-generated video footage can be used to target a multitude of offences including dangerous driving, driving without due care and attention, contravening solid white lines, mobile phone use, improper control of vehicle and contravening red traffic lights.

Fewer than one in five of the 33,000 cases sent to police have resulted in no further action, records show. That means around 80% of submissions have sparked court cases, awareness courses, fixed penalty notices or warning letters

According to latest records, fewer than one in five of the near-33,000 cases uploaded by the public have resulted in no further action by police.

Nextbase says this has 'demonstrated the success of the platform in identifying the most severe of incidents and linking motorists with police in a bid to crack down on this behaviour'.

Bryn Brooker, head of road safety at the dashcam maker, said, 'These stats show that the portal is needed now more than ever and I would like to remind the public of the fact that Dash Cam technology can help other road users, as well as you and your passengers.

'If we all work together, with the police, to continue to identify the worst of the worst – those dangerous drivers that, put simply, should not be allowed behind the wheel – then we will continue to see motorists from across the country interacting with the Portal.

'This is why it was built, to make the roads of this country safer for those of us that are just trying to get from A to B and go about our daily routines.

'We have watched this platform grow from both a public and police perspective and are hugely encouraged by its continued appeal.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Unprecedented monetary stimulus around the world has driven stock markets higher since the coronavirus crash but what will happen now that inflation is rearing its head?

Markets are anticipating a strong recovery and fiscal stimulus has joined rate cuts and money printing in turbo-charging the US and other major economies, says Barry Norris, of Argonaut Capital, which is delivering some of the fastest economic growth that he has seen as an investor.

He says: ‘That means that this year should be a really good year for the general economy and Main Street, but it may not be as good for Wall Street and particularly those high growth stocks which benefited the most from low interest rates.’

Highly-valued growth superstar shares have the longest time horizon in term of expected returns, and Barry believes while last year was great for growth investors this year will be much better for investors in old economy companies, value and commodities. And he believes one asset that could be hit hard is cryptocurrency.

He joins Richard Hunter and Simon Lambert to discuss the best near term prospects for investing in the recovery and why he believes unfashionable European value and dividend shares could be a winner.

Barry runs a European Income fund and also Argonaut’s Absolute Return fund, which allows him to go both long and short. He reveals some of the types of company he is betting against with short positions and why he is particularly dubious on cryptocurrency and bitcoin.

‘I would describe myself as a bitcoin minimalist,’ he says, adding that while he sees the potential in the concept, he does not see its value being justified, comparing it to a ‘pyramid scheme’ or ‘chain letter’ where those who got in early make profits and those that buy in late ‘are the fall guys’.

Barry says: ‘I see value in the blockchain idea of a cryptocurrency potentially disintermediating the need for a financial intermediary in transactions, but the problem is is that the only killer app for cryptocurrency at the moment is money laundering and financial extortion, hence the fact there is a ransomware attack almost every day.

‘For most people their interest in crypto is purely speculation. Unfortunately, crypto only has a value if everybody uses it in transactions and the only killer app at the moment is normally something that is criminal.’

He adds: ‘Crypto is the poster child of inane empty calorie speculation.’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investors have been backing a strong rebound from the coronavirus lockdowns – and are already reaping the rewards from some consumer economy shares that have leapt since vaccines were revealed.

The US and UK are among the countries powering ahead in vaccinating people against Covid-19 and look poised to benefit from the re-opening trade, with many people eager to get out and enjoy themselves.

Some stocks have soared in the expectation of not just a return to normal but a predicted mass desire to get out and spend lockdown savings.

Yet, at the same time we shouldn't underestimate how many people are still concerned about getting back to their old way of life - and how things have changed, Tom Becket argues on this episode of the Investing Show.

Meanwhile, even if a consumer boom arrives will this effect last long enough for the economy to gain both escape velocity from the hefty coronavirus recession but also a momentum that will last for some years, taking the developed world out of the low-growth and into a Roaring Twenties?

Or should investors expect a world that’s very different to the one seen before the coronavirus crisis, but that unfortunately sees the US, UK, and Europe slip back to low growth?

And just how much will the vast quantities of debt and money printing enlisted to to fund fighting the pandemic skew the future?

On this Investing Show, Tom Becket, CIO of Punter Southall Wealth, joins Richard Hunter and Simon Lambert to discuss the prospects for shares, whether there are any safe havens left for investors, and where the best opportunities lie.

Will investors see a Roaring Twenties of stock market returns as forecast by some, or a return to low growth for the developed world after the recovery bounce?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@‘As long as you’re not taking an apocalyptic view of the world – which is almost always wrong to have an apocalyptic view – then I think there’s plenty to be optimistic about,’ says Nick Train – one of Britain’s best known fund managers.

The manager of Finsbury Growth & Income trust and one half of the Lindsell Train fund management duo has built a reputation for conviction investing over the years.

He joins Simon Lambert on this episode of the Investing Show to discuss a year 'as challenging as I can recall as a professional investor', but why the coronavirus recovery combined with accelerated adoption of technology could unleash huge productivity and wealth gains across the global economy over the next five years.

Train discusses how that fits with Finsbury Growth & Income’s tight portfolio of under 25 different companies and the impact it could have on its well-known consumer names, ranging from Diageo, to Hargreaves Lansdown and Burberry.

Finsbury Growth & Income has grown to almost £2billion in size under Train's 20 years of stewardship, with growth of 237.5 per cent over the past ten years and 62.2 per cent over the past five years.

The trust has a dividend yield of 1.9 per cent and ongoing charges of 0.64 per cent.

Although Finsbury Growth & Income slipped over the past year - down 1.7 per cent in the 12 months to the 1 February - this was better than the 7.7 per cent average decline in the UK equity income sector.

Over the past decade, Finsbury Growth & Income's approach has delivered rewards for long-term investors, with its share price up 237.5 per cent

Considering the events of the past year, a decline of less than 2 per cent is a more than respectable return for a portfolio that is 75 per cent invested in UK companies, but Train acknowledges in many investors' eyes it will compare unfavourably with the returns they have seen from the US stock market over the same period.

Nonetheless, Finsbury Growth & Income is UK-focussed trust and he believes many of its 25 holdings can capitalise in years to come.

He says that the past year has highlighted how companies in different sectors using digital technology to their advantage can take swift steps forward and engage better with their customers.

This is a key to searching out the winners for the years ahead, argues Train.

He says: ‘We’re going to need to find – within the context of the UK stock market – more UK companies, whether they are classic technology companies or right across the industrial base, that can exploit technology to strengthen and enhance their businesses and at all costs avoid companies where technology is unravelling their business franchise.’

Train discusses his investing style – and how he was influenced by Warren Buffett – and explains why he runs a relatively tight portfolio and targets companies that you can understand and have the opportunity to compound success.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When estate agency group Belvoir unveiled its 2019 figures on March 30, 2020, Britain had just entered into its first lockdown and chief executive Dorian Gonsalves said he thought Covid-19 would have a significant effect on trading for the rest of the year, so much so that the final dividend was axed.

In the event, Gonsalves – and Belvoir's shareholders – were pleasantly surprised. The company proved far more resilient than anyone had hoped.

Revenues and profits rose substantially, the dividend was reinstated and the company continued to expand organically and through acquisition.

Growth has continued at pace ever since. Last week, Gonsalves said first-half revenues were 41 per cent higher than in 2020 and 53 per cent ahead of 2019, driven by strong demand across every part of the business.

On the move: Soaring demand for new homes has boosted revenues for estate agency Belvoir

Belvoir differs from many peers because it operates a franchise model, with 243 franchisees effectively acting as small businesses, supported by Gonsalves and his team.

This makes the group nimbler and more entrepreneurial than many large property firms, a particular bonus during the ups and downs of the pandemic.

The company also derives around 90 per cent of its revenues from rentals, rather than sales.

Commercial property landlords have had a tough time during the pandemic, as tenants suffered from closures and lockdowns. But the residential rental market held its own.

Belvoir suffered from virtually no arrears last year and in the first half of this year, underlying rental revenues rose 10 per cent, with further strong growth expected through 2021 and beyond.

On the sales side, Belvoir has benefited from soaring demand for new homes, as people rush to find larger properties more in keeping with flexible working lifestyles.

Headquartered in Grantham, Lincolnshire, the company is well located too, with a strong presence in the Midlands and the North, where activity has been buoyant for both sales and rentals.

Belvoir derives around 90 per cent of its revenues from rentals, rather than sales

In recent years, Belvoir has moved into financial services as well, offering mortgage advice through 242 independent advisers. In June, this business was bolstered with the acquisition of Nottingham Building Society's mortgage advice division.

A small deal right now, this should drive future growth, as the building society has been building a name for itself in the Lifetime ISA space, with savers likely to turn to Belvoir's advisers when they want to use their cash to buy a home.

Brokers expect that group revenues for 2021 will climb by 25 per cent to £27million, with profits rising at a similar pace to £9.3million. Belvoir is a decent dividend payer too.

The dividend for 2020 was 7.2p and this year, 7.4p is forecast, although that may well increase if the group continues to exceed expectations.

Midas recommended Belvoir in 2016 when the shares were £1.21 and we looked at the business again just before the first lockdown, by which time, the price had risen to £1.78. It slumped to below 100p in March last year but has since soared to £3.

Brokers believe there is further to go and Gonsalves is certainly optimistic, actively seeking acquisitions and helping franchisees to expand as well.

Midas verdict: Belvoir shareholders have been well rewarded and may choose to reduce their holdings, now that the price has reached £3.00. But they should retain at least 50 per cent of their stock.

Belvoir is well positioned to benefit from continued demand for new homes, the financial services business should accelerate growth and the dividend offers a decent income too.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As more people look to book holidays and head abroad in the coming months, a list of the best firms to travel with has been compiled by Which?

Exodus, Explore and Discover Egypt were the only three firms given the top rating of green+ as they were the only ones able to guarantee refunds in the event a customer was told to self-isolate prior to travel, according to its new holiday checker tool.

The consumer group compared the booking policies of more than 80 of the UK's package holiday providers and rated each as red, amber, green or green+, depending on how they perform against criteria set by experts.

Aside from the three 'best' travel firms, British Airways Holidays, First Choice, Hays Travel, Jet2 Holidays, Trailfinders and Tui were put in Which?'s green list, based on their refund policies.

Only three companies were found to have the highest rating of Green+ on Which?'s new tool

The tool has been created in response to the travel industry's reaction to the coronavirus pandemic.

Holidaymakers are likely to have long memories after last year with thousands complaining their provider was taking months to refund them - or they couldn't get through to their travel firm at all.

As a result, the tool looks to help point customers in the direction of the companies with the best flexible booking options so they can book with greater confidence and know they're less likely to be left out of pocket should something go wrong.

The research considered each firms policies on coronavirus-related disruption.

This included whether firms would refund customers in the event of a lockdown, if FCDO advice changes, if the customer is told to self-isolate before travelling and if customers are forced to quarantine in a hotel on their return.

Following a rise in concerns about people being contacted by NHS Test and Trace before they are due to travel, the experts also asked companies if they would provide full refunds in the event someone is told to self-isolate.

Only three firms including Exodus, Explore and Discover Egypt guaranteed refunds in this situation, as well as every other situation put to them by Which? and were rated green+ as a result.

Meanwhile, companies that committed to offering refunds in most scenarios put to them by Which? include British Airways Holidays, First Choice, Hays Travel, Jet2 Holidays, Trailfinders and Tui which were rated green.

This will likely provide some reassurance to customers who have already booked with these firms as well as encouraging others to book with them in the future.

Meanwhile, there were several companies placed on the red list with holidaymakers advised not to book with these providers.

Lastminute.com, Love Holidays, On the Beach and Teletext were all on the list after they were found to be putting customers at risk of being out of pocket if they are unable to travel as planned.

The research found these firms faced many shortcomings with their booking terms and commitments including not refunding customers in the event of coronavirus-related disruption with a lack of transparency about their policies.

In response, an On the Beach spokesperson said: 'We know it's difficult to make a decision about going on holiday at the moment – it's part of the reason that we stopped taking new bookings for this summer back in May and we continue to provide customers with as much flexibility as possible.

'If the FCDO advises against travel to a destination, our customers can change their holiday destination or dates free of charge, and we will waive any of our admin fees.

'If they wish to cancel their holiday, we will fully refund hotel and transfer costs, and our regulated, ring-fenced trust account means that we are able to do this quickly and always in cash rather than credit notes or vouchers.

'Prior to the pandemic, when the FCDO advised against non-essential travel to a destination, this triggered the closure of airspace and the cancellation of all non-essential flights.

'During the pandemic this has often not been the case, with airlines continuing to fly to affected destinations and many consumers still wanting to go on the holiday they have booked.

'Our holidays include flights from multiple third party airlines and the decision on whether to operate those flights lies with each airline. If the airline cancels the flight, then we will, of course, pass the refund straight on to our customers in full.

'Wherever customers are entitled to cancel and receive a full refund under the Package Travel Regulations then we will refund customers in full and in cash.'

A number of holiday providers were put on the Red list including Lastminute.com & Teletext

It added that if a customer wishes to cancel their holiday due to FCDO advice but the flight operates as planned, the airline retains the monies paid for the flight and in those instances this leaves it unable to pass a refund onto its customers.

However, Lastminute.com, Love Holidays and Teletext did not provide comment.

Companies that did not provide clear information on their booking policies were also rated as red for a lack of transparency.

While red companies' policies were not necessarily in breach of consumer law, some have faced investigations from the Competition and Markets Authority in the past year over failure to refund their customers including Love Holidays and Teletext.

Therefore, Which? is advising consumers against booking with a red company and to check before they book to ensure their holiday provider offers a good flexible booking policy.

Companies' ratings will be regularly evaluated to keep up to date with any changes to their policies as well as any changes to rules around international travel.

However, the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO) has hit back at Which? over the new tool claiming it is unfair to list firms as Red when the travel industry has been one of the worst hit.

Chris Rowles, Chairman of AITO, said: 'In a pandemic when no travel company has been able to trade for 17 months and all have had to dig deep into their own pockets to refund customers as quickly as they could, one expects better of our so-called consumer champion, Which?

'It may have escaped the attention of the team at Which? that, during the pandemic, travel companies have earnt no income whatsoever – they are paid only when clients depart on holiday, and our Government has not permitted any outbound travel from the UK except, mostly, for truck drivers.

'This is clearly not normal business practice and one would hope that those who run Which? might perhaps have been a tad more understanding than normal in recognition of these key facts and the struggle to survive that the travel industry has faced over the past year and a half.'

Several holiday firms have been ordered to refund customers by the CMA after taking too long

It is perhaps unsurprising that some of the firms are in the red list with This is Money previously reporting that Teletext could face legal action after failing to return more than £7million in refunds to customers.

The CMA said in May that the holiday firm had failed to address complaints from hundreds of customers who had not received refunds on cancelled trips within 14 days as required by law.

In response, hundreds of customers told us they had been waiting months, if not over a year, for a refund from the firm.

Many were waiting for thousands of pounds back but found it impossible to get through to the company by either phone or email.

Love Holidays was also investigated by the CMA in December of last year and was forced to refund 44,000 customers more than £18million for trips cancelled during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Lastminute.com also agreed to pay over £7million in refunds to customers for cancelled holidays in the same month after many customers complained they had to wait longer than the legal requirement to be compensated within a fortnight of cancellation.

Rory Boland, editor of Which? travel, said: 'Between changing travel restrictions, both in the UK and abroad, and the ongoing risk of being told to self-isolate, booking a foreign trip still comes with some uncertainty and things can go wrong if you've chosen the wrong provider.

'The best companies won't leave you high and dry though, so it's vital to do your research before booking.

'The difference between choosing a red company over a green company could be losing the entire cost of your holiday if circumstances change and you have to amend or cancel your plans.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The mini-housing boom has seen the average price of a home in Britain rise around £24,000 during the past year to almost £245,000.

But this doesn't mean to say that it isn't still possible to find a bargain if you're currently on the lookout for your next home to buy.

We have found some examples on property website Zoopla of homes that cost less than a fifth of the typically priced British home.

You may need to compromise on location or condition, but the relatively low price tag may be enough to tempt you to take a closer look.

We reveal four homes for sale with price tags of £40,000, including this four-bedroom detached house in the Scottish Highlands (scroll down for more details)

Tom Parker, of Zoopla, said: 'The property market is enjoying a once-in-a-generation boom but that doesn't mean there aren't bargains to be had if you look hard enough.

'While you won't often get the finished article for £40,000 there's plenty of properties with ample opportunity to be improved if you have the money and imagination.'

It comes after the average value of a home in Britain was revealed to have risen by around £24,500 between July last year and the end of June this year.

Nationwide said that the average cost of a home now stands at £244,229, although this is a drop from £245,432 in June, following the end of the stamp duty holiday.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: 'Buyers had rushed to complete deals before the deadline, with the number of housing market transactions soaring to a record high of almost 200,000 in June, which is around twice the typical monthly number before the pandemic.'

All of the selected properties are in the North and Scotland, and some need updating.

But two have the benefits of being moments from the sea, an unexpected perk that is likely to appeal to house hunters amid the pandemic - especially when the price tag only reads £40,000.

Here are pick of homes with price tags of £40k…

1. Four-bed house in Unst, Scotland,

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Buying property to rent out used to be lucrative until the Government introduced new taxes on second homes and removed the tax break on mortgage interest.

That hasn't stopped investors being drawn to residential property, which is what the UK Residential REIT (URES) is banking on when it lists on the stock market later this month.

This real estate investment trust focuses on mid-market rental properties in cities outside of London.

Residential property is usually an illiquid asset, so a trust, where you buy and sell shares in it, is an attractive option

Kee Gan, chief investment officer of L1 Capital, the company behind URES is targeting city centre flats that will generate immediate income, using economies of scale to refurbish them and gain rental uplift.

The trust won't be starting from scratch. When it floats it will acquire a seed portfolio of more than 1,200 properties and a pipeline of £440million in investment opportunities from L1 Capital.

This seed portfolio has performed well during Covid, with 96 per cent rental collection last year and 95 per cent average occupancy over the past two years.

The trust's targets are ambitious. Gan believes it can support a 5.5 per cent dividend yield and annual returns of 10 per cent – the stuff dreams are made on for Britain's beleaguered savers.

Residential property is usually an illiquid asset, so a trust, where you buy and sell shares in it, is an attractive option. They are also a way of holding property within a pension or Isa.

But there are reasons to be cautious. Ryan Hughes, at investment platform AJ Bell, points out that many homeowners are already hugely invested in the British property market. So an investment in residential lets could overexpose some.

Midas verdict: This end of the residential lettings market is not easy to gain exposure to as an individual investor, but it can be lucrative. L1 Capital has a decent track record.

Its first two property funds generated double-digit annual rates of return last year. Those interested in acquiring shares as the company lists can do so through brokers including AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown and Interactive Investor.

It is among a bunch of firms from the newly-capitalist economies which saw the City as an attractive place to float.

They reckoned without the London discount, which has made the UK a honey-pot for private equity barons.

Feeding frenzy: London-listed vodka distiller Stock Spirits has become the latest target for the private equity barons

Hard on the heels of a bid for Czech-based cyber-security Group Avast by America's Norton Life Lock, comes a £1billion offer by CVC for Stock with a decent 41 per cent-plus premium.

CVC is on a roll. It is involved in a messy battle in Spain for control of La Liga, but encountering resistance from its two most garlanded members, Real Madrid and Barcelona. It controls Formula One and did a strategic deal with Six Nations Rugby during the pandemic.

The words around CVC's deal with Stock are familiar. CVC is going to be investing in its 'strong track record of product innovation' and tap into the popularity of its brands among millennials. In other words, getting a lot of young people drunk.

As wonderful as that may be for the directors and shareholders, they should consider downsides. Loading up companies with debt is never a good idea, especially in a turbulent pandemic age. And, as colleagues at Avast and Norton are learning, the easiest way to jump-start margins is to sack people.

In a report on the summer madness, broker Peel Hunt points out that 12 UK public companies have come under offer since July. The most high-profile is the botched bidding war for supermarket Morrisons.

The most vexing is the undermining of the UK's aerospace capacity with the deals for Meggitt and Ultra Electronics.

And the least desirable is the offer for inhaler developer Vectura from Philip Morris. It has the medical establishment up in arms, including the Royal College of Physicians.

What also is clear from the Peel Hunt note is that private equity need have no fear of rejection as almost every deal is 'recommended'.

The idea that 'nodding dog' independent directors should ever get in the way of grasping executives becoming instant multi-millionaires through share incentive plans is alien.

As strong results from investment banks Barclays and Goldman Sachs – along with professional services such as PwC – demonstrate, everyone in finance has an abiding interest in getting deals over the line.

The broader interest of stakeholders, employees, suppliers and consumers or the nation, doesn't stand a chance against financial muscle.

Cashing out

No one could accuse Aviva boss Amanda Blanc of dragging her heels. In her 12 months in charge of the insurer, she has executed £7.5billion of disposals and is now dishing out the largesse with plans to give £4billion back to investors.

The first £750m is going on a share buyback. That will tidy up a sprawling equity base. But unless the company can find a winning formula to grow and to keep earnings and shares rising, then investors may feel cheated.

They will hope that as the rest of the cash is released over the next year, most of it will come as a special dividend. Aviva's balance sheet clean-up, including paying down £2billion of debt, and £300million in cost reductions should go some way to keeping Swedish activist investor Cevian at bay.

Blanc's next task will be making sure Aviva can keep growing in an increasingly digital sector. Disrupters such as newcomers Marshmallow pride themselves on undercutting incumbents.

The legacy of a strong advisers network also means Aviva is able to attract inflows into investment products. But the disruption of traditional channels by fintech upstarts could make that harder.

If the longer-term goal is a more progressive dividend, it might have been worth keeping some of the cash back for transformative, long-term investment in tech and marketing channels. That's not on the activist agenda.

Social justice

The Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) says it has no role in policing Britain's food security at Morrisons. But it can't resist poking the social media giants.

A preliminary ruling that Facebook's acquisition of online image creator Giphy raises serious concerns is gutsy, since the target company has no direct presence in the UK.

Facebook control could potentially deprive other platforms of the right to access animated images known as GIFs.

A fascinating intervention, but couldn't the CMA unleash its anti-trust enforcers closer to home?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently called for Britain's pension funds to put their weight behind the UK economy by investing more of their money in big infrastructure projects.

Their call to infrastructure arms was made earlier this month in a letter to investment managers. 'It's time we recognised the quality that other countries see in the UK,' they said, 'and back ourselves by investing more money into the companies and infrastructure that will drive growth and prosperity across our country.'

A number of investment managers – including 3i, HICL and GCP – already run stock market listed funds that invest in infrastructure projects.

For example, the £3.3billion HICL Infrastructure fund, a component of the FTSE250 Index, generates a steady stream of income for shareholders from a global portfolio of assets.

In the UK, its investments include the operation of a maximum security jail (Addiewell) on behalf of the Scottish Prison Service – and a hospital and three mental health facilities on behalf of two Birmingham NHS foundation trusts.

The result is a trust that is providing investors with a steady quarterly income – equivalent to 4.7 per cent a year – unaffected by lockdowns and the pandemic.

While HICL Infrastructure has been around for 15 years, investment trust JPMorgan Global Core Real Assets is in its infancy.

It was launched in September 2019 to invest not only in income generating infrastructure projects, but also real estate (commercial property) and transport (container ships and trains).

It has taken a while for the trust to make its investments – not helped by the pandemic – but it is now nigh on fully invested.

The result is an uptick in the quarterly dividend payments it is making – one penny per share compared to 0.75pence a year ago – and the promise of more income in the pipeline.

Philip Waller, part of the management team, says the trust's target income is between four and six per cent a year with the opportunity for a little capital growth on top.

'We see this trust primarily as a good portfolio diversifier for someone looking for income,' he says. 'It's investing in a spread of assets that are uncorrelated to each other, and to other financial assets such as equities.

'Further diversity comes from the fact that it has both unlisted and listed holdings and has exposure to nearly 650 infrastructure and transport assets and more than 200 real estate buildings. The portfolio is truly global.'

Three per cent of the fund is in UK assets. The income comes from the leasing of assets such as container ships, trains and industrial units, as well as investments in renewable energy projects.

Among its top holdings is a stake in US real estate trust Prologis, which specialises in logistics facilities.

Alan Brierley, an analyst at Investec Bank, recently issued a 'buy' note on the trust. This is after rating it a 'sell' as a result of the long time it was taking the managers to make its investments – and the share price trading at a premium to the value of the trust's underlying assets.

But with these issues largely resolved – the trust's premium is down to a reasonable 5.3 per cent – Brierley believes the JPMorgan fund provides investors with an important source of income diversification which should show 'defensive characteristics in more turbulent market conditions'.

The trust has assets valued at £200million, its stock market identification is BJVKW83, and annual charges total 0.71 per cent.

Although the current share price of 93p is below the £1 launch price, Brierley believes the prospects for asset growth and attractive dividends are encouraging.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2014, Korean Air flight 86 was forced to return to the gate at JFK airport after first-class passenger Heather Cho erupted in anger when her welcome snack of macadamia nuts was served in a packet rather than on a plate. Cho's father happened to be the big boss at Korean Air, and when the incident became public, there was outrage.

Cho eventually served a few months in jail but the incident highlighted the excesses of Korean 'chaebols', huge industrial conglomerates controlled by superwealthy families.

These privileged dynasties have for years faced accusations of bribery and corruption.

Driving growth: Giant Korean companies including car maker Hyundai help power profits in the fund WKOF

For canny investors however, their apparent susceptibility to scandal presents an opportunity.

Many Korean companies, quoted on the local stock exchange, have two classes of shares – voting and non-voting. The structure was designed to ensure that founding fathers retained control of their businesses after they were floated and remains prevalent to this day. As compensation, however, nonvoting shares traditionally pay out slightly higher dividends than ordinary stock.

This generosity seems to count for less among investors than the loss of voting rights and the nonvoting assets, known as preference shares, routinely trade at a significant discount to their voting counterparts.

Weiss Korean Opportunity Fund was set up to take advantage of this anomaly. Founded in 2013, the fund has delivered strong returns ever since, significantly outperforming both the local Korean market and stock markets more broadly.

The shares are £2.71, they are listed on AIM and should increase materially over time, paying annual dividends along the way.

The Weiss Korean Opportunity Fund, or WKOF, was created by Andrew Weiss, originally an academic, now Professor Emeritus at Boston University and the boss of Weiss Asset Management, a huge US investment firm.

Weiss and his team began looking at Korea over a decade ago and soon sensed that there was money to be made from the preference share sector.

Today, WKOF is invested in the preference shares of 36 Korean companies, from well-known names such as Hyundai Motor Company and LG Electronics, to lesser-known firms such as CJ CheilJedang, a global food company with a fast-growing sideline in natural animal feed.

All these businesses have one issue in common. Their non-voting shares trade at a significant discount to the voting shares, most recently calculated at more than 50 per cent. In other words, the preference shares are half the price of the ordinaries, while still paying out more in dividends.

The massive discount reflects persistent concerns that Korean firms' autocratic founders have too much power and might abuse it. While examples of such abuse abound, there are clear signs that Korea's corporate culture is changing for the better.

Once, Korean firms were renowned as poor dividend payers, preferring to keep cash at hand to use on ill-thought-out pet projects, or worse. Today, dividends are growing, suggesting that financial discipline is improving.

Corporate governance is higher up the agenda too, as firms try to put Korea's scandal-ridden past behind them.

At the same time, Korean companies are at the forefront of some of the fastest-growing areas of business and industry, from sophisticated technology to green energy. South Korea consistently ranks as one of the world's biggest investors in research and development, an investment that is already paying off in terms of top-range phones, televisions and other gadgets and is likely to generate growth through this decade.

The country also produces many of the world's lithium-ion batteries, used to power electric vehicles, including Tesla cars.

Yet the South Korean market is cheaper than many other stock markets, when measured by the prices at which shares trade, compared to the earnings they generate. Regional peers, such as Taiwan, India and Japan, are all more expensive than the Korean KOSPI, an index which tracks the country's listed businesses.

If the Korean market is cheap and the preference shares are half the price of ordinary stock, investors in this sector benefit from a double discount. This is expected to narrow substantially over time and, for certain companies, it already has, allowing WKOF to increase in value consistently year by year.

This performance is widely expected to continue. The Weiss team is deeply experienced, they have a broad network across South Korea and keep a constant eye on generating value for shareholders, including Weiss himself, with a near 8 per cent stake in the business.

Midas verdict: South Korea is a long way away and Korean preference shares may seem rather exotic for some UK shareholders. But several of the world's best-known businesses hail from Korea. The Weiss Korea Opportunity Fund is determined to prove its mettle and an update later this week should prove encouraging. A long-term buy for the adventurous investor.

Daniel's posts come one month after he penned emotional essay about stepping away from music amid personal struggles during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The musician, who last released music in 2017, returned to Instagram for the first time in over a year in July to share his private battle.

'Dear anyone, the world is in a very strange order at the moment. It's very confronting and bemusing,' he began the lengthy post.

'The reason I've not released music is not because of that. Sometimes I need to feel like a human being and feel what other human beings feel while believing that I am important or creative. I am not. I need to create. There is no need for people to see, hear or appreciate it,' he continued.

Johns, who previously struggled with anorexia and mental health issues, went on to reveal he's been enjoying living out of the public eye in recent years.

'I have been learning that the longer I'm away from people's opinions the stronger I become. Art is not a way to receive validation,' he wrote.

'I believe it's a way to feel connected to whatever this is and not a way to make people feel something for you.'

The Straight Lines hit-maker admitted he's 'not sure what he's doing', but cryptically insisted that he is sure 'how he wants to do it'.

'In a time where people need guidance I cannot help as I'm seeking it myself. This is not a cry for help / this is a way to say to anyone who's listening or reading it's OK to be confused, disillusioned, saddened. It's also OK to be inspired, optimistic and brave,' he wrote.

His post ended on a more positive note, as Johns advised fans to remember love and friendship are 'real' and the 'ability to be open-minded is vital'.

'Just try to know that the world wants you to be good and true. This is a mantra I will try to tell myself as well. Sometimes it's hard and sometimes it's harder than we can't even comprehend, sometimes it's even easy,' he wrote.

'Be calm and accept anarchy and rebellion/ intelligence and kindness. Run to the hills or the ocean if you need? Also we're all going to die so try and have some fun.'

The biography The Book of Daniel, by Jeff Apter, made shocking claims about Johns' two-year eating disorder battle when he was a teenager.

'He started to test himself, seeing how little he could eat and still get by and his weight slipped to 50kg,' the author said.

Johns is quoted in the book as saying he didn't realise 'how bad his illness had gotten', adding: 'I was just eating so I wouldn't collapse.'

Eventually overcoming the disorder, Daniel faced another health crisis when he began suffering from arthritis in 2002.

The former One Show host, 43, was left overwhelmed when he was able to fix a vehicle that was special to his dad Michael on Saturday evenings show.

Hearing the engine roar, the TV presenter said: 'I tell you what, that takes me back. Even that engine. That has hit me in the heart that has.'

Emotional: Matt Baker fought back tears on his new TV show Our Farm on the Dales on Saturday

Matt left his life in London behind and moved back to his family farm in the Yorkshire Dales last year after his mum Janice suffered an accident while working on her farm.

He decided to take over the running of the farm alongside his family and the Channel 4 show Our Farm on the Dales has documented his journey.

In the latest episode Matt was determined to repair the vintage car, which has sat unused for two decades.

Vintage: The former One Show host was left gobsmacked when he was able to fix a vehicle that was special to his dad

Matt said: 'For 20 years, my dad's old car's been rusting away as an eyesore at the side of the farm.

'It's been weighing heavy on his mind. It's caused me a lot of sleepless nights, because it's just a shame to see it go. And I couldn't do anything about it.'

Matt took the car to a local restoration garage to see if it could be fixed.

He said: 'It would mean the world if it could be saved, but I'm not holding out much hope.'

The garage door opened to reveal the car, with the mechanic inside at the wheel, he turned the ignition key and the engine roared to life.

Matt was elated and shouted 'There she is!'

Worth a try! In the latest episode Matt was determined to fix his dad Michael's old car, which has sat unused for two decades

'I tell you what, that takes me back. Even that engine. That has hit me in the heart that has.'

'It's just amazing, I expected to come in here and have a poke around underneath - I never in a million years expected you to reverse it off the ramp.'

The star got emotional adding: 'It's incredible. I think what we need to do is show it back to my dad and say 'look dad, this is the story, what do you reckon?

'He's going to be amazed. What's making me feel more emotional is knowing what this is going to mean to my dad.

Matt said: 'For 20 years, my dad's old car's been rusting away as an eyesore at the side of the farm

'I think he'll be delighted to hear she's doing everything in her power to get back onto the road.'

Previously Matt's mum broke down in tears while filming after she revealed that she suffered from a fall while tending to the farm's herd of sheep, which saw them knock her to the ground.

Matt then admitted he felt he needed to be back home more, so he can be there to help out his family.

Hearing the engine roar the TV presenter said: 'I tell you what, that takes me back. Even that engine. That has hit me in the heart that has'

After Janice's accident, the family were left concerned that they'd have to give up the farm entirely.

Matt told the series: 'The Hampshire Downs [which are a breed of sheep] that we have bred here for years are big sheep. They are on the large end of the scale as far as sheep are concerned.

'I think, now at the stage that you're in and what has happened that - and this will be hard to hear as you've put so much effort into the flock that we've got - I just don't think that they are the way forward, for you now.'

The star got emotional adding: 'It's incredible. I think what we need to do is show it back to my dad and say 'look dad, this is the story, what do you reckon?'

Janice replied, through tears: 'It's quite a strange feeling really, sitting here doing this in the sunshine. It's the first time I've actually had to make a decision because of what's happened.

'It's the right decision. I know it's the right decision and you reach a time in your life when you think "I really can't do this anymore".

'In that respect it's sad, but in a good way, a fork in the road might mean good things will come from it in a different way.'

Matt admitted that it's hard for him to realise his parents aren't as young as they used to be.

He said: 'It's a really big deal for my mum. And it's tough, you know. You get to a point in your life when you have to look after your parents and you have to do your best to make sure everything's alright.

'And that was always weirdly your parents' role when you were growing up. Suddenly there's that role-reversal.

'We're going to spend a lot more time up here because work and things have changed for me and one of the reasons I stopped what I was doing was because I wanted to spend more time with my family and be here a lot more.

'The timing of it couldn't be any better. It's strange the way the world words.'

Yet Bella Hadid's romantic getaway came to an end on Monday as she was spotted leaving Ibiza on a private jet.

The couple have been inseparable during recent weeks with some passionate displays of affection during their time together.

Jet setting: She has been holidaying with her new boyfriend Marc Kalman, 33, in Spain. Yet Bella Hadid 's romantic getaway came to an end on Monday as she was spotted leaving Ibiza

The runway star, 24, was sporting a navy Adidas jumper and floral leggings which she paired with white trainers.

Sartorially in sync with his girlfriend, Marc also opted for comfort in a navy T-shirt and matching black face mask.

The pair wore protective face masks entering the airport due to the ongoing threat of COVID-19.

On Sunday, the supermodel gave fans an insight into her romantic getaway as she shared a bikini-clad snap while enjoying pizza and board games.

The runway star was sporting a mysterious bruise on her right thigh as she draped her toned leg over a blue patterned cushion.

Bella, who was laying next to a backgammon board, captioned her post: 'Undefeated.'

Fun in the sun: On Sunday, the supermodel gave fans an insight into her romantic getaway as she shared a bikini-clad snap while enjoying pizza and board games

The Vogue cover star is a backgammon enthusiast and was spotted picking a new board during a trip to Paris last month.

Bella stunned in a pink and maroon triangle top showcasing her taut midriff.

The brunette beauty's long waves spilled over her shoulder as she reclined next to a glass of white wine and a pepperoni pizza.

Prior to becoming romantically involved with art director Marc, Bella was in a long-term relationship with The Weeknd, which ended for good in 2019.

Bella and Marc went Instagram official with their relationship this past July with a now-deleted post made to the model's Instagram page.

However, a source recently spoke to Page Six and noted that the two had been seeing each other ever since last summer, with the insider noting that the two 'hid it well.'

Wow! Bella stunned in a pink and maroon triangle top showcasing her taut midriff as she shared snaps from her romantic trip

The source also elaborated on the pair's methods that they used to keep their relationship a secret in its early stages.

'If they went out, he would come out first, get the car, and then she would get into the car. They would drive to a location, and he'd drop her off but not get out and go park the car,' they specified.

They went on to note that the pair 'were very diligent about not being seen on a public street at the same time.'

The source expressed that the two kept things toned down in public and opted for dates that included her friends.

According to the individual, Bella and Marc never shared 'any PDA...and most of the time they were with other people, which of course made it difficult to prove that they were dating.'

However, the source noted that many people began speculating that the model was seeing her now-boyfriend when his car began being regularly seen at her residence.

They said: 'This new guy [at the time] was driving her around in his Porsche, and then the Porsche was [at her place] overnight multiple times...So it was like, "She's got to be hooking up with this dude."'

The insider concluded by speaking about their Instagram picture, which was later deleted, and noted that the two waited a year before going public with their romance.

'They basically came out on their anniversary — or somewhere around it,' the source noted.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Greg Wise has joined the Strictly line-up in memory of his late sister, Clare, who died in 2016, in a bid to end the stigma surrounding talking about death.

The Sense and Sensibility star, 55, has spoken out about how there is scarce material out there to help others going through the same heartbreak as their family did.

Greg, who is the husband of Dame Emma Thompson, has said: 'It's essential. It's important. I'm trying to get people to talk about death as much as they talk about the run up to birth'

His mission: Greg Wise, 55, joined the Strictly line-up in memory of his late sister, Clare, who died in 2016, in a bid to end the stigma surrounding talking about death

Clare died aged 51 after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013, when she started a blog documenting her journey. She was then told that the disease was incurable after it spread into her bones.

Greg also wrote about his own experience with his wife's battle in a series of journals, which were later published as a book.

In the journals he spoke about how Clare was unique and the family thought it was fitting for her to have a glittery coffin.

In a statement on appearing on this year's show he said: 'My beautiful sister was a huge disco queen. She left our world almost exactly five years ago in a glitter ball coffin. This is for her.'

End the stigma: The actor has spoken out about how little material is out there to help others: 'I'm trying to get people to talk about death as much as they talk about the run up to birth'

Being a Strictly fan, Greg said that his elder sister would have been ecstatic about the news of him going on Strictly, even though he claims he cannot dance.

Greg said: 'My gorgeous diva sis would have been insane with excitement that her little bro was doing this. I will channel her, as her bro can't dance - but I'm thrilled to be dipping my toes, knees, hips and arms into this wonderful world'

Back in 2016, Greg cancelled a family holiday in Greece and moved into his sister's London flat in the final three months of her life, in order to be her full-time carer.

On the night she died Greg wiped her face, told her he loved her and gave her permission to go when she wanted. She died one minute later, holding his hand.

Greg is an actor known for his various film, television and theatre roles, including The Crown, Cranford, Walking on Sunshine and his breakout role in Sense and Sensibility.

Big fan: Being a Strictly fanatic, Greg said that his elder sister would have been ecstatic about the news of him going on the show; Clare and Greg pictured in 2014

Greg also wrote box-office hit film Last Christmas with his wife, Emma, and the book Not That Kind of Love with his late sister Clare.

Emma and Greg share two children together, 33-year-old Tindy and Gaia, who is 21 years old.

He revealed that wife Emma was 'stupidly excited' he would be appearing on the show.

Speaking on This Morning, he said: 'It's going to be so important having her there. She's done three films back-to-back this year, so she's exhausted now anyway.'

He also admitted he is 'more nervous' about having the spotlight on him - due to him being a part of the dance show - than he is about taking to the dance floor and strutting his stuff.

Sweet: He revealed that wife Emma was also 'stupidly excited' he would be appearing on the show. 'It's going to be so important having her there'

When it was suggested there would be a lot of attention on him during his Strictly stint, he said: 'Yeah, which is one of the things I'm slightly more nervous about than the actual dance steps.

'But it's about being out there and exposing yourself as someone who can't dance, and learning.'

Moments earlier on the show, Matilda 'Tilly' Ramsay was revealed as the ninth contestant.

The CBBC presenter - who is the daughter of chef Gordon Ramsay - was unveiled during Wednesday's episode of This Morning and her famous father also made a cameo as he recorded a clip to show to her.

In the video, Gordon, 54, cheekily warned Tilly, 19, not to date any of the dancers, while Tilly admitted she was 'terrified' of the challenge that lies ahead.

Also joining the star-studded line up is presenter AJ Odudu, along will comedian Robert Webb, Olympian Adam Peaty, Dragon's Den star Sara Davies, and actress Nina Wadia.

Eastenders' Rose Ayling Ellis will be taking to the dancefloor with Corrie's Katie McGlynn, BBC Breakfast host Dan Walker, England rugby union star Ugo Monye, and TV presenter Rhys Stephenson.

Other famous faces include Loose Women panellist Judi Love, and McFly's Tom Fletcher.

And on Monday's Lorraine, Octavia Spencer, 51, and Kate Hudson, 42, enthused about their friendship and working together on the Apple+ crime series.

Octavia - who also produces the show - plays Poppy, an old friend of Kate's character Micah, and both women raved about each other's talents.

Happy ladies: On Monday's Lorraine, Octavia Spencer, 51, and Kate Hudson, 42, enthused about their friendship and working together on the Apple+ crime series Truth Be Told



Speaking to Ross King, Octavia gushed: 'Octavia the producer thinks of Kate, the actor, as one of the greatest actors out there and it's an honour that she said yes, because she made our season that much more fun - for Octavia the actor - but also for our viewing audience because she brings such a richness, such a depth to Micah.

'Octavia the actor is excited to be working on a show that's extremely fun and a genre that I actually do watch every night.'

Kate added: 'Octavia loves true crime, I can attest to this. Octavia not only knows every true crime series - or has seen it - but also she knows things that are happening in real life.

'She gets really into how crazy some of these stories are. So if there's anybody to be producing a true crime show, it's Octavia.'

Women supporting women: Both women raved about each other's talents

Speaking of Octavia as a producer, Kate joked: 'She demanded so much of me, we had some really tough times on set!

Kate continued: '[Ross] you've interviewed a lot of people and I'm sure they always say it comes from the top. When you have great energy on set and you have a really great leader, that's where it all trickles down from.

'Octavia is that leader, she is just absolutely loveable, warm, generous, smart, attentive, makes everybody work at their best.'

Speaking about the extra pressures of producing during a pandemic, Octavia explained: 'Our escape as a society, as a world for this pandemic, is your creative outlets - books and your viewing pleasure, so I think it's incumbent upon us to put out material that allows for a little escapism.

Talented: Octavia - who also produces the show - plays Poppy in Truth Be Told

'I'm excited that doing a true crime show like Truth Be Told, we have active viewership. You're sitting on the edge of your seat and for me, I'm a fan of the genre and so I would literally watch it in one day if I could.'

Commenting on the show's plot, Kate said: 'You have these moments that go beyond just the who dunnit, it's also how we're all related to each other so it's got a really juicy… I think it's going to keep a lot of people engaged.'

Of their own friendship, Octavia revealed: 'We had met in passing at some sort of awards event and we're fans of each other. And just to play opposite someone who is always ready to play and mix it up.

In character: In The Apple+ series, Kate plays Micah, an old friend of Poppy's

'There were times when Kate would always keep me guessing - something in rehearsal and she would bring something different to each take we filmed, which made it really exciting.'

Kate agreed: 'We could disarm each other and at the same time I think, Octavia and I could make each other cry in five seconds. We really did energetically feed off each other.'

Octavia added: 'Having a scene partner and a season partner in Kate was just really, really fun.'

And on revealing any secrets about Octavia, Kate said: 'I will never tell!' To which Octavia sang: 'That's what friends are for.'

Woah there! Michelle guided the way as she carried a chaise lounge

The third series of Brassic is set to hit screens later this year after series two ended on a cliffhanger as Vinnie confessed his true feelings for single mum Erin (Michelle Keegan) just as he was being carted off by the police.

As he was being lead away, Erin, who has dated his best pal Dylan, whispered something inaudible in his ear.

Declaring his feelings, Vinnie said: 'I know it's wrong, but you're the first thing in the morning, and you're the last thing at night.'

He then added he didn't know 'how to tell' how much she means to him.

Brassic follows the story of Lancashire native Vinnie, who has bipolar disorder and his best friend Dylan (Damien Molony) from whom he has been inseparable since childhood.

A tainted past, the boys have dealt, scammed, bribed and conned their way through adolescence.

Now, on the brink of adulthood, their dealing and stealing is catching up with them, with the repercussions of their crimes heading their way.

Michelle plays alongside them as a single mum seeking a better life for herself and son Tyler (Jude Riordan).

While navigating complicated relationships with the show's leads Dylan and Vinnie, she still strives for a good childhood for her son.

The new series of Brassic is expected to air on Sky One in October following the rise of the previous seasons.

The actress, who has been married to the TOWIE star turned TV presenter, for six years, hit out at sexist double standards - admitting queries about when she is going to have a baby do 'bother' her now.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine, she said: 'A few years ago it didn't bother me and I answered the question.

'But now I think, ''I don't need to answer that because nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors''.

Exciting: The third series of Brassic is set to hit screens later this year

'I remember when I finished Our Girl people were like, ''Is it because you're going off to have a baby?''

'I know for a fact if Mark finished a job, nobody would ask him if he was going to have a baby. It's not fair. It does make me feel frustrated.'

Michelle and husband Mark have been together since late 2012 when they met while they were both on holiday in Dubai.

The former TOWIE star popped the question nine months later and the pair married in a lavish ceremony at Hengrave Hall in Suffolk in May 2015.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Dune's director, Denis Villeneuve, recently spoke about his plans for a potential sequel to the forthcoming feature.

The filmmaker, 53, recently spoke to Il Venerdi Di Republicca and gave the media outlet a bit of information regarding his future plans for a follow-up film, should one be produced.

The upcoming flick is based on Frank Herbert's 1965 novel of the same name and will premiere at the 78th Venice International Film Festival, which will occur next month.

Looking to the future: Dune's director, Denis Villeneuve expressed that he has plans for a follow-up to the soon-to-be-released feature; he is seen in 2013

During the sit-down, Villeneuve remarked that he was excited to begin work on a sequel to Dune and commented on the chemistry between its lead actors.

'I can't wait to shoot the second part of Dune to get [Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya] back together,' he said.

The Call Me By Your Name star will portray Paul Atreides in the film, and the Euphoria lead is set to play his romantic interest, Chani.

The Blade Runner 2049 director also pointed out that he planned to place a new character at the forefront of the film in the planned feature.

Excited: During an interview, the filmmaker expressed that he 'can't wait to shoot the second part of Dune to get [Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya] back together'

Taking the lead: The filmmaker also revealed that Zendaya's character, Chani, will serve as the main character in a potential follow-up flick

Specifically, he noted that 'in the next chapter Zendaya will be the protagonist of the story.'

Development on the soon-to-be-released version of Dune initially began in 2016 when Legendary Entertainment acquired the rights to the book.

Alejandro Jodorowsky was previously set to direct an adaptation of the novel that would have starred figures such as Orson Welles and Salvador Dali, although plans fell through in the mid-1970s.

David Lynch went on to helm a feature based on the book that starred Kyle MacLachlan that was released in 1984 and was met with a negative critical reception.

In the past: Development on the current version of Dune was initially started in 2016 when Legendary Pictures acquired the rights to the book

Not the first: David Lynch previously helmed an adaptation of the book, which was released to negative reviews in 1984

A miniseries was later produced and broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel, now known as Syfy, in 2000, which was received well by both critics and fans of the novel.

Villeneuve officially signed on to direct Dune in 2017, and he also serves as one of its producers.

The forthcoming film will feature an ensemble cast including performers such as Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson and Jason Momoa, among numerous others.

Principal photography initially began in March of 2019 and continued throughout the year until it officially concluded that July.

Further filming for the forthcoming feature was conducted the following year in Budapest.

Dune was originally supposed to have its premiere in November of 2020, but it was eventually delayed on numerous occasions owing to the ongoing state of the global pandemic.

It was ultimately given a wide debut date of October 22nd, where it currently stands.

Taking their time: Dune was originally supposed to be released in November of 2020, although it was later delayed several times

Villeneuve has expressed concern about Warner Bros' decision to dual-release the feature in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service, as the film's producers fear that Dune will not be profitable enough to warrant a follow-up.

A preview of the flick's first ten minutes revealed that the movie was being released as Dune: Part One, lending further speculation that a second motion picture is being planned.

A spinoff series entitled Dune: The Sisterhood is currently being developed and will serve as a prequel to the film.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The stamp duty holiday and house price rises have led to a spike in the number of mortgages lent to those more at risk of defaulting.

The number of single-income households borrowing four or more times their salary hit a five-year high at the beginning of this year according to new figures, as buyers grappled with rising house prices.

In the first three months of 2021, 12.6 per cent of new mortgages were lent to people in that higher-risk category, according to auditors Mazars.

Risky business: Banks are lending a larger proportion of mortgages to those borrowers who are in theory more likely to default on their loans, according to new figures

This was the highest proportion since 2016, and a jump of more than one percentage point since before the pandemic in the first three months of 2019 when 11.4 per cent of single-income customers borrowed more than 4 times their wage.

Mazars blamed the increase on the stamp duty holiday and low mortgage interest rates, which it said had 'tempted more buyers to stretch their finances'.

Interest rates are at historic lows, with Halifax having launched a two-year fixed rate at 0.83 per cent.

Buyers at all levels of the market have been forced to pay more for their homes since the start of the pandemic.

This was thanks to a surge in demand for moving house as people's lifestyle needs changed, as well as the stamp duty holiday which offered people a maximum tax saving of £15,000 before it was tapered down to £5,000 at the end of June.

The latest estimates suggest that house prices jumped by 10.5 per cent in the year to July, increasing by around £25,000.

Most mainstream lenders will only allow mortgage holders to borrow 4 or 4.5 times their salary, though those with significant equity built up in their homes often borrow far less.

Highly mortgaged: The proportion of individual home buyers borrowing more than 4 times what they earn in a year has increased to 12.6 per cent according to Mazars

However there are exceptions to that rule. For example, Nationwide changed its policy earlier this year to allow first-time buyers to borrow up to 5.5 times their salary - 20 per cent more than its standard limit.

To do so, though, they would need to lock in to their mortgage deal for at least five years.

Those who own less of their homes proportionally are also at higher risk of negative equity if house prices were to fall.

Paul Rouse, partner at Mazars, said lending at higher salary multiples could cause problems for both customers and lenders down the line, especially as Government wage support schemes such as furlough came to an end.

He also said it would likely lead to higher levels of personal debt, especially for first-time buyers who usually borrow the most relative to their salaries because they do not have equity from an existing home to draw on for their deposit.

'Some borrowers, notably first-time buyers with small deposits, may have over-extended themselves,' Rouse said.

'If the exit from the lockdown is bumpier than expected, this could lead to significant job losses.

'It would be miraculous if such a huge blow to the economy can be absorbed without higher levels of personal insolvency.'

Since the pandemic mortgage lenders have been under growing pressure from the regulator to offer more support to borrowers who find themselves unable to meet their payments.

While this could be good news for customers, it could land lenders in hot water.

'Lenders are finding themselves in an uncomfortable position, as they face pressure from regulators to offer forbearance to struggling borrowers,' Rouse said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@‘We’re pretty excited by the outlook for a lot of reasons and literally at the moment we’re in sell to buy mode,’ says Georgina Brittain, manager of JP Morgan UK Smaller Companies trust.

‘We have such a list of things that we’d like to own, but we don’t want to sell anything and we don’t have any cash.

‘That is such an exciting place for a fund manager to be. You’re trying to find the thing that you’re most happy to sell but you don’t really want to. But you’ve got such other great opportunities.’

On this episode of the Investing Show, the UK smaller and medium-sized companies specialist joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter to discuss the broad range of opportunities that she and her team are finding as the coronavirus recovery gathers pace.

Georgina talks about three of the major holdings in the trust’s portfolio, highlighting the diversity of great British small companies on offer to investors: publisher future, homeware and furnishing star Dunelm, and life-sciences and healthcare specialist SDI, which she describes as an acorn that has a buy and build growth strategy that could really pay off.

The fund manager with more than two decades’ experience also discussed how she and her team handled the coronavirus crash and the rebound since.

She says: ‘I have managed money for almost 25 years. You think you’ve seen it all. You know that at times it’s stressful or very stressful. Last year was off the clock, is the only way to describe it in terms of the stress.’

Finally, with investment big hitters, such as Scottish Mortgage, saying they need to look further afield for exciting young companies and increasingly delve into the unlisted space, does Georgina still see great opportunities coming through?

She says that while you need to be incredibly careful, backing IPOs as a small cap investor can pay off – and that the UK market has plenty of those coming through.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Is a simple portfolio made up largely of shares and balanced out by some bonds and cash, the answer to long-term returns?

While some multi-asset funds can seem to take a delight in their complexity, that straightforward mix is enough for Iain McCombie of Baillie Gifford’s Managed Fund.

The fund, which invests in a mix of growth company shares and government and corporate bonds around the world, along with some cash, has more than doubled investors' money over the past five years.

Over its 33-year life, the Managed Fund has averaged 75 per cent in shares, with the rest in bonds and cash.

Its performance figures show returns of 35.9 per cent over one year, 60.9 per cent over three years and 117.5 per cent over five years, compared to 10.7 per cent, 18.2 per cent and 44.9 per cent, respectively for its IA Mixed Investment 40-85 per cent sector average.

That’s been done by taking a long-term view of good equity and bond investments and sensible asset allocation, says Iain, who joins our latest Investing Show.

He says the Managed Fund’s approach is simple, easy to understand and can be all you need to generate good returns, but he adds that just because something is simple, doesn’t mean it is easy.

The manager explains how the fund invests, with four equal equity portfolios in the UK, US, Asia and Europe, run by individual regional investment teams, who look for the best growth opportunities with a five-year view.

The top ten includes familiar global names, such as Tesla and Amazon, but these make up a far smaller slice of the broadly spread portfolio than they do in Baillie Gifford’s big name growth investment trusts and funds, such as Scottish Mortgage.

Iain runs the UK equities side of the fund and discusses the companies he invests in that fit that best of the best bill. These range from long-term profit machine Ashtead, to what he dubs ‘Boring Bunzl’, and kitchen stalwart Howdens.

He also discusses whether investors should try to buy more of quality companies when share prices fall and how worries over rising inflation could affect investments.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investment bankers in London and New York are poised for their biggest bonuses in a decade amid a huge surge in deal-making.

As the economy rebounds from the pandemic, banks are reaping the rewards from a frenzy of stock market floats and corporate takeovers, a report says.

The bonanza has boosted profits, and many are now putting big sums aside to hand out. Bonuses this year could soar by as much as 35 per cent, says consultancy firm Johnson Associates.

Deal bonanza: As the economy rebounds from the pandemic, banks are reaping the rewards from a frenzy of stock market floats and corporate takeovers, claims a new report

Many lenders froze or cut bonus pools last year because of the Covid-19 crisis. But the massive bounce back since then, coupled with rising complaints from junior bankers about long hours, means rewards are on the rise again.

Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, said: ‘The industry has performed at a level that last year we thought was impossible.’

His firm expects investment bankers in advisory roles to see bonuses rise by 20 to 25 per cent, while those working in underwriting are set for a 30 to 35 per cent increase.

British banks HSBC, Lloyds and Barclays are among those increasing bonus pools, while Natwest is reviewing the matter.

Barclays increased its bonus pool from £749million to £1.1billion this year, while HSBC has topped up its own by £650million in the first half. Lloyds will spend an extra £100million on bonuses.

Pay is expected to rise at Wall Street banks as well. Goldman Sachs has hiked pay by £2.5billion compared to a year ago, while JP Morgan has raised it by £1.4billion.

Along with rival Morgan Stanley, the US banks have raised pay for junior bankers as well after complaints about working conditions.

The rise in bonuses is also likely to prove controversial among politicians and campaigners, at a time when the economy is under pressure from the pandemic.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the architects of Thatcherism has damned Morrisons’ suitors as ‘vulture capitalists’ keen to asset strip the grocer.

Lord Vinson, 90, who co-founded the Centre for Policy Studies with Margaret Thatcher, said a private equity buyer would look to extract £1billion from its property portfolio.

The Tory peer believes staff at Morrisons supermarkets should be ‘really frightened’ by the prospect of the grocer losing its independence, adding it will ‘leave this country poorer’.

Tory peer Lord Vinson, who co-founded the Centre for Policy Studies with Margaret Thatcher (pictured), said the former Prime Minister 'wouldn't have liked' Morrisons' private equity deal

He demanded Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng step in, adding that even Mrs Thatcher would have ‘disliked’ the deal.

The comments came as Clayton Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), under the former Tesco boss Terry Leahy, prepares to raise its bid for Morrisons and overtake the consortium led by Fortress, which upped its offer to £6.7billion, or 272p per share, last week.

Lord Vinson said: ‘Mrs Thatcher might have said “It’s the market and you take the rough with the smooth”, but fundamentally she wouldn’t have liked it.

‘It doesn’t bring any benefit except to the bidders. I’m all for free markets and free trade, but there comes a point where it should be conducted within a moral framework.

There is only one reason for US vulture capital’s interest in Morrisons, they want to trouser a billion pounds. They want to take money out of the business by asset-stripping.’

He added: ‘We’ve seen it happen so often, as with Debenhams. Why can’t somebody in the Government say: “We don’t like the look of this?”’

He called for all takeover bids over a certain size to be referred to a beefed-up Competition and Markets Authority.

A series of big City and Westminster names including former Iceland boss Bill Grimsey, Darren Jones, the chairman of the MPs’ business committee, and Labour peer Lord Sikka have raised concerns.

Fortress, whose bid has been recommended by Morrisons’ board, has pledged to protect jobs and maintain a substantial chunk of the property portfolio.

The promises are not legally binding. Sources have suggested that CD&R, which also owns B&M, will publish its own pledges when it returns with a fresh bid.

Fortress said: ‘We are focusing on long-term sustainable value creation and place very significant emphasis on the wider responsibilities of ownership.’

Analysts say a sale of assets is likelier if the price rises above 270p a share, as a buyer seeks to claw back its investment.

On Monday, the Takeover Panel confirmed an extension to the deadline for CD&R to bid to 5pm on August 20.

The date for shareholders to vote on Fortress’s offer has been pushed back 11 days – to August 27.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The decision whether to invest in Medica Group, the provider of services to hospital radiology departments, largely comes down to how fast you think elective surgery rates will recover to pre-pandemic levels.

In a recent trading update covering the first half of the year, the company reported 'a sustained recovery in activity in diagnostic services'.

Medica's customer base comprises more than 100 NHS trusts, as well as Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) plus many private hospital and insurance groups, and it is well-known that there is a growing backlog of surgery waiting to be performed.

Medica Group provides services to hospital radiology departments

Management revealed in the July trading update that elective surgery activity is back to 75 per cent of pre-Covid levels and the board is counting on the release of pent-up demand for its services, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computerised tomography), ultrasound and plain film (x-ray) scans, to drive growth into and beyond 2022.

The elective surgery part of the business accounts for around 35 per cent of revenues and so a speedy return to more normal levels of elective surgery would certainly ginger up the top-line.

It seems obvious, however, that the ability of healthcare organisations to clear this backlog of operations (and thus spark increased demand for Medica's teleradiology services) is dependent on them not being overwhelmed with emergency care for Covid-19 sufferers.

It is probably too early to call it one way or the other as we wait for the effects of the July loosening of lockdown restrictions to become apparent but – touch wood – the signs look promising.

As of 8 August, 47million people in the UK had received at least one vaccine jab and 39.4million had received a second, which should contribute to keeping hospital admissions at manageable levels.

Meanwhile, more than two-thirds of 18-30-year-olds have had their first jab, which should allay some fears about this age group being hesitant to receive the vaccine.

While the seven day average of the number of daily admissions to UK hospitals has risen from around 100 in mid-May to 742 in early August, this is nowhere near this year's peak of 4,126 cases seen in early January and is showing signs of waning in any case.

Before the coronavirus pandemic changed everything, things had been going fairly swimmingly for the group, with double-digit percentage revenue growth each year for ten years.

The group has a stated ambition to double revenues from 2020's level by 2025 by consolidating what it believes is a leadership position in UK teleradiology services while branching out into allied areas of growth.

More than 85 per cent of its revenues in 2019 (i.e. pre-pandemic) came from repeat business, via customers who had been with the group for at least two years.

Medica's bespoke information technology platform is described as 'robust and secure' and is scalable, which is to say the company can take on new clients without significantly requiring heavy capital expenditure.

That being said, the company is investing in the platform, seeking to enhance functionality and provide proprietary (i.e. Medica-owned) interfaces between its customers and Medica's team of radiologists.

In July, Medica said that it was counting on a rise in demand for its services, which include MRI scans and X-rays, among the others

House broker Liberum, commenting on the half-year trading update, said better cost control and an improved business mix 'means gross margins are likely to be at least in-line with last year, which is well ahead of current consensus forecasts'.

Of equal importance to the elective surgery business to Medica is its Nighthawk out of hours radiology reporting business, which also generates around 35 per cent of group revenues.

Dr Stuart Quin, the chief executive of Medica, told investors in July that the recovery of elective scanning activity in health services is now well underway and Medica is seeing a sustained recovery in elective scanning volumes as a result.

The NightHawk business in the UK is also putting in a solid performance due to continued growth from existing customers, he added.

The company is not pinning its hopes solely on a resurgence in non-Covid-related operations in the UK to fuel growth; it is also expanding into new markets and services in the US, Ireland and Australia.

As in the UK, the group saw eye-catching growth in the first half of the year in Ireland, where its services include diabetic retinopathy screening services.

The increase in scanning activity is putting pressure on radiology department capacity, providing the opportunity for Medica to step in and support out-of-hours reporting provision across Ireland. Meanwhile, the group's ophthalmology screening contract in Ireland reported a strong performance in the first half.

Elsewhere in the world, reported revenues for the US RadMD business, acquired in March of this year, have continued to grow although this growth has been tempered by a continuation of slower-than-normal patient recruitment into existing clinical trials due to the ongoing pandemic.

As restrictions are lifted across the US, Medica is starting to see patient numbers, and therefore RadMD's activity and order book conversion, increase.

Which brings us back to where we started, namely the company being somewhat hostage to fortune when it comes to how soon things can return to business as usual for healthcare organisations.

Medica's current share price of 163p means it is valued on 22 times forecast earnings for the current year, which is higher than the market average; however, since floating in 2017, the average price/earnings ratio of the stock has been 28.1, reflecting the unprecedented interruption to day-to-day proceedings in the healthcare world.

As normal service is resumed, that price/earnings ratio should head back up, suggesting now is an opportunistic time to buy the shares.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The cost of a detached house has surged by around £46,000 since the pandemic began as buyers searched for more space, according to Rightmove.

The price tag for such a home has soared by 10 per cent, hitting over £500,000 on average nationally. Back in February last year, the average cost of a detached house was £471,406.

In contrast, the average asking price of a flat has risen by just 1 per cent, or around £2,000, in the same period and is now worth £277,302.

How much? The cost of a detached house has surged by around £46,000 in the past year

There are signs that flats are starting to make a comeback, however, with the number of sales agreed up by 14 per cent in June and July compared to the same point last year.

This has the potential to push the price of flats up in the coming months, driven by lockdown restrictions easing, medium to long term working patterns becoming clearer and better availability of low-deposit mortgages, Rightmove said.

The cheapest location to get on the property ladder is the North East of England, with average asking prices for flats at £103,098, while the most expensive area outside London is the South East, where average asking prices for flats are £235,073.

The average asking price for a flat in London is £534,054, marking a drop of 2 per cent since February 2020.

Tim Bannister, Rightmove’s director of property data, said: 'Navigating a busy market can be daunting for buyers, especially if they’re looking to get onto the property ladder for the first time.

'However the latest data might suggest an opportunity for some first-time buyers, with average asking prices for flats currently up by 1 per cent, which is significantly less than the price increases we’ve seen for other property types.

He added: 'The sharp rise in average asking prices for detached homes probably comes as no surprise to those who have been following the rush for room that emerged when the market reopened, and with available stock still limited and strong demand continuing, we’re unlikely to see prices fall for this property type anytime soon.'

Property listings continue to fall

The number of properties being listed for sale continued to drop last month, pushing house price inflation up further, according to a separate closely-watched survey published today.

The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said new instructions from sellers 'moved deeper into negative territory' last month, and are at their worst level since April 2020.

With the primary phase of the stamp duty holiday gone, newly agreed property sales and queries from prospective buyers also fell last month, the Rics said.

But house prices continued to rise everywhere in the country, with the North of England, Wales and East Anglia seeing particularly strong growth. On the flip side, house price growth in London was markedly weaker.

Experts at the Rics said some buyers were struggling to move up the property ladder amid high demand for houses with more space over smaller flats.

Dwindling: The number of properties being listed for sale has continued to drop

Waning: Queries from prospective buyers fell last month, according to the Rics

The Rics said tight supply was a 'crucial factor' in sustaining higher house prices across the country 'for the time being.'

A total of 66 per cent of estate agents surveyed said they thought property prices would continue to rise over the next year, up from 56 per cent in June.

But new buyer enquiries shrank in July, ending a positive four-month streak for the housing market.

The Rics added: 'As a result, the number agreed sales also reportedly took a dip, posting a net balance of -21 per cent in July across the UK, with sales volumes slowing most notably in Yorkshire & the Humber, the East Midlands and East Anglia.'

Ian Macklin of estate agency group Ian Macklin & Company in Hale, Greater Manchester, said: 'The ending of the stamp duty holiday has resulted in fewer new instructions and sales which are broadly back to the levels previously experienced.'

Summing up the survey's findings, Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Rics, said: ''Although the tapering in stamp duty is beginning to have some impact on RICS activity indicators, the overall tone to the market remains firm with the metrics capturing price expectations showing few signs of wavering.

'Significantly, a strong message from survey respondents is that buyers are continuing to place a premium on space with the prospect of a hybrid model of work being adopted by many organisations providing the opportunity for greater flexibility around location.

'This is being reflected both in the challenge some current homeowners are having in moving up the property ladder, as well in stronger price expectations from the Rics survey for larger than smaller properties.'

On the up: Stock shortages are pushing property prices up
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the stand-out features of the pandemic has been the reliance many Britons have had on streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime, Disney, Netflix and Now TV, to help cure the indoor boredom.

When it comes to choosing what to watch next, many of the streaming giants have a section with recommendations - and more often than not, they feel fairly out of sync.

Greg Vartoukian had enough of this and the pandemic prompted the self-confessed film buff to start work on an idea he'd had for a number of years: a personalised film and TV recommendation website.

Watch Clever's 'taste fingerprint' - essentially a blueprint of your personal taste - which also screens for quality, narrows down the very best recommendations.

Netflix and Chill: streaming platforms tend to push their own original productions over genuine recommendations

Streaming services don't prioritise recommendations

Despite a career largely spent in corporate circles - including a stint as financial director of the London Business School - Greg is no stranger to the glamour of the film industry.

A decade ago he invested in a small film with Hollywood star Idris Elba, and was even cast as an extra, all the while sitting on a very early idea for what would become Watch Clever.

'For some years I felt there wasn't a way to find stuff that truly suited my individual taste. There's movies which can be critically acclaimed or rated highly but that doesn't always necessarily mean that I'm going to particularly enjoy it,' Greg says.

Greg's own film taste is far from high brow - his top three films are Back to the Future, Gladiator and Enemy of the State.

'That was part of it - I have quite an accessible taste, a lot of the film critics however do not necessarily have that taste and that was part of the challenge.'

When he first thought about a more personalised way of recommending films, he thought the streaming giants would beat him to it.

Streaming platforms have been a real pandemic winner - the number of subscribers in the UK increased by more than 8million in 2020.

Greg Vartoukian started work on Watch Clever during the pandemic

They have now monopolised TV consumption, with the number of subscribers now double the number signed up to traditional pay TV providers like Sky and BT.

But this dominance means they have little incentive to finetune their own algorithm, instead pumping out their own original content in favour of their users' tastes, according to Greg.

As the country braced itself for a national lockdown Greg started to think seriously about how to develop Watch Clever: 'I had a broad vision of what I wanted to develop, I certainly didn't have it all mapped out but I thought let's give it a go.'

By the start of summer 2020 the wheels were in motion.

Developing a taste fingerprint

Greg and his small team of developers created a model where each film or TV show is auto-labelled by a set of characteristics, including pace, intricacy and emotional punch.

These same characteristics are used to develop a user's taste fingerprint, which is initially configured when they pick their top three films during the sign up process.

Users can then apply a taste filter to all searches so only films which score a one - a perfect taste match - or 2 will appear in the search.

'Movies and TV shows are typically classified by genre but I thought that was insufficient.

'There are DNA characteristics in a movie - if it's fast, emotional, intricate or surreal… I love comedies but I don't like surreal comedy so it's being able to go beyond just the comedy genre without having to do a load of research.'

Watch Clever asks users in-depth questions about their film and TV taste to develop a taste fingerprint

Watch Clever also screens for quality using Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb data - as well as a mood filter, which incorporates shortcuts like feel-good or intriguing to help users decide what to watch.

So far it has proved popular. It piloted the website at the end of 2020 before launching in 2021.

It has since attracted 50,000 users from almost 80 countries, an impressive feat given it has largely neglected traditional marketing in favour of Search Engine Optimisation and Search Engine Marketing.

'Because of the universal appeal, when people search on a search engine they ask "I need a good movie to watch tonight" or "what are the newest TV shows", "what can I watch on Netflix" and being directed to us.'

The next challenge for Greg is building his premium membership, of which there are just a few hundred users.

For £19.99 a year, users can filter search by streaming providers, filter all search options by mood, year or rating, and access curated lists.

Soon it will start to offer a personalised newsletter, and is even looking at developing a joint taste fingerprint to take the stress out of Netflix and Chill.

A logical step forward would be to make an approach to partner with some of the major streaming platforms, a move Greg has not ruled out.

'We really want to get up and running and establish ourselves before connecting with some of those. It's definitely something for the future- there's various different ways in which we could potentially connect, one being the algorithm… we're not quite there yet.'

Watch Clever is still in its early stages but it has managed to tap into something most people who use streaming sites find increasingly frustrating.

CVC Capital Partners has agreed to buy the vodka-and-rum maker for £767million in a 377p-per-share deal.

Stock Spirits said it was the fifth unsolicited offer CVC had made.

Taking Stock: CVC Advisers has agreed to buy the vodka and rum maker for £767m in a 377p-per-share deal. Stock Spirits said it was the fifth unsolicited offer CVC had made

The deal is the latest in a string of companies to be swooped on by private equity businesses since the pandemic struck.

A staggering 123 firms had been bought between the start of the outbreak and May 2021.

The pandemic plundering has seen companies including Asda, Aggreko, Signature Aviation and LV fall into the hands of buyout barons.

And the likes of Ultra Electronics and Morrisons are now being circled.

Stock Spirits is focused on Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, the Czech Republic and Italy, which account for around 80 per cent of its sales.

Its best-known drinks include 1906, Stock Prestige and Syramusa.

The company, which has been dubbed a ‘mini Diageo’, has a portfolio of more than 70 own brands and about 70 third-party drinks which it distributes.

It is based in Buckinghamshire, but only has around two dozen employees there.

CVC’s offer is 41pc higher than the value of the company’s stock before the deal was announced.

But last night Stock Spirits’ shares rocketed 43.7 per cent, or 117p, to 385p, suggesting investors believe there will be a bidding war for the company.

Analysts agreed, with Shore Capital describing the bid as ‘modest’, adding: ‘An approach for Stock Spirits is understandable in our view given its leading market position across European markets, notably in Poland and Czech Republic.

‘It remains to be seen if the bid flushes out counter offers from the industry.’

Stock Spirits listed in London in 2013. It has had several spats with its largest shareholder, Western Gate Private Investments, including one earlier this year, when Western Gate slammed the board for pursuing an aggressive merger and acquisitions strategy instead of giving more money back to investors.

CVC’s plot to buy Stock Spirits was announced on the same day that it was successful in striking a deal to invest in Spanish football league, La Liga. The private equity group will invest £1.8billion in the organisation – around a 10 per cent stake.

It marks its first deal into a major European football league, although it has been heavily criticised by Spain’s two largest clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid.

CVC could be a controversial buyer for Stock Spirits. It is the largest private equity company in the UK and also one of the most ruthless.

Founded in 1981, CVC has been a breeding ground for some of the UK’s leading fund managers including Jon Moulton, Mike Smith and Frank Neale, who all went on to become titans of the industry.

The firm is notoriously private and likes to operate away from the public spotlight.

CVC has its tentacles across all parts of British life, most famously in retail.

In 2003 it was part of a consortium that bought Debenhams. CVC was accused of a quick flip, buying the retailer on the cheap, loading it with debt and then refloating it at a big profit.

Debenhams collapsed last year under mounting debts.

Last month CVC snapped up a significant stake in Six Nations Rugby. CVC also has stakes in Premiership Rugby, the Pro 14 and breakdown recovery company RAC.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The national lockdowns over the past year have given people plenty of time to reflect on their jobs, lifestyles and passions.

This has led many to embrace their entrepreneurial spirit and work on a hobby or idea that has always been on the back burner due to career commitments.

Olympic sailing champion Hannah Mills MBE, gold medal winner in Tokyo, found herself in the same situation after the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games were called off at the start of the pandemic last year. With training on hold, she had the time to develop her sustainable not-for-profit brand the Big Plastic Pledge.

Here's how she did it - and how you could bring your passions to life in the form of a side hustle or full-time career.

Point of sail

Hannah’s sustainable side hustle was launched in 2019 after the athlete, who won a silver medal at the Olympic Games London 2012 and a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Rio during 2016, was shocked by sailing through beaches, marinas and harbours that were littered with plastic.

She had always wanted to do something beyond sailing that gave her a feel-good factor, and tackling sustainability issues provided that opportunity.

'Growing up, I was obsessed with the Olympics and only thought about standing on the podium with a medal,' she says.

'I felt early on with my career that while I loved sailing, I wasn’t necessarily delivering on other personal values of giving back and making a difference to more than just my sport.'

The two-time world champion decided to use her sporting background, networks and profile to raise awareness, change behaviour and influence others on environmental issues through an initiative called the Big Plastic Pledge.

To turbocharge her efforts, she used GoDaddy. Through their Websites & Marketing product, she was able to take the website to the next level, reaching her target audience at scale with new online toolkits and even incorporating new ecommerce capabilities, enabling her to sell sustainably sourced products direct to customers.

Plus, GoDaddy is helping to take the Pledge to the next level by developing, redesigning and hosting new toolkits for Hannah’s network of Olympic ambassadors and to share tips with UK micro-businesses for ways to become more sustainable in their operations.

Riding the waves

She admits that the initial launch of the campaign, which aimed to eliminate single-use plastics from sport, felt rushed - but says the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games gave her time to focus on the future aims of the campaign initiative.

'With the onset of the pandemic, I wasn’t able to train, freeing up much of my time,' Hannah explains.

'I felt I was running to keep up with everything that was going on beforehand but the being out of my strict training regime gave me time to think about what we were doing and to focus on bringing athletes on board rather than doing lots of events.'

She also used the time in lockdown to upskill and took an eight-week sustainability course at a university which she said gave her a new perspective and clearer goals.

She explains: 'Learning again was really good and I came back to the Big Plastic Pledge with more clarity.'

This helped develop the pledge, which encourages athletes and people playing or involved in sport to commit to three out of nine sustainable changes.

These include refusing to use plastic straws and encouraging clubs and events to use alternatives to plastic.

More than 3,000 people have signed the pledge so far and Hannah is working with other athletes to promote it, and she's pushing the pledge as part of her role as a European Climate Pact Ambassador for the International Olympic Committee too.

Making dreams a reality with GoDaddy

Gaining traction through any type of business or campaign in a pandemic was always going to be a challenge due to restrictions on seeing people face-to-face. But Hannah says her website has played a key part in communicating the message clearly.

'We wanted the Big Plastic Pledge to be accessible globally and that is why we needed a website with the products and tools on-hand for us to deliver our message effectively.'

Via GoDaddy, Hannah has been able to spread her sustainability message on an international scale without needing any marketing expertise.

Their Website + Marketing package, for example, has ready-made templates for social media posts and marketing communications. All you need to do is fill in the details then GoDaddy does the hard work for you, giving your fledgling idea the support it needs to get off the ground.

For Hannah, this isn’t just a temporary side hustle. She says she's in it for the long haul and still plans to make waves with her campaign once she retires from sailing.

'My passion and my drive is all around sustainability and sport,' she says.

'I want to maximise the network I have got through sailing and the Olympics to make a difference.

'These toolkits, built and launched in partnership with GoDaddy, make it manageable and achievable for businesses to cut down on plastics on an individual level, and have the potential to be incredibly powerful if used in numbers.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New drivers are being urged to watch out for bogus car insurance deals being promoted on social media, as thousands of learners are hoping to pass their test following more than a year of disruption.

Fake car insurance sales - known as 'ghost broking' - is a growing scam that involves fraudsters pretending to be insurance brokers in order to sell unrealistically cheap and subsequently fake policies.

These are often advertised to younger drivers - who often face paying out four figure sums for cover - via Facebook and Instagram, according to research from the Insurance Fraud Bureau.

The not-for-profit organisation is now warning learner drivers to be careful when purchasing insurance online as it could cost them their first car.

New drivers are urged to watch out for bogus car insurance deals promoted on social media

There is set to be a large influx of new drivers on the horizon following confirmation from the Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency that driving test centres face an unprecedented challenge to reduce waiting times left by the pandemic.

While learner drivers in a driving school are typically covered by their instructor's insurance policy until they pass their test, they will need to take out motor insurance for their first car.

However, with a rush of new drivers approaching and with so many people facing financial hardship, the IFB is concerned it will provide an opportunity for ghost broker scammers.

Stephen Dalton, head of intelligence and investigations at the IFB, said: 'The last thing new drivers need right now is to risk losing their car for no insurance because they've been duped by a scammer on social media.

'Drivers must carry out basic checks to make sure they're buying car insurance through a trusted provider, or they'll be making a very expensive mistake.'

Mark Magee, Head of Driver Policy at the DVSA, added: 'The DVSA's priority is to help everyone through a lifetime of safe driving.

'As well as ensuring you have the skills, knowledge and understanding attitude to drive safely, having valid insurance is of the utmost importance when you drive on your own.

'Check to make sure insurance brokers are genuine before parting with your money.'

Fraudsters often tempt younger people with their bogus car insurance deals by promoting unrealistically cheap prices up front, despite the fact insurance is meant to be priced based on the risk of the individual.

They often then encourage contact with them through popular end-to-end encrypted messaging software such as WhatsApp.

Watch out: Fake car insurance sales known as ghost broking is a growing scam online

The IFB, an organisation that works with the police to crackdown on organised insurance scams, has seen its investigations into ghost broking double since 2016, and the scam has remained prevalent throughout the pandemic.

Investigations have found cash-strapped young drivers forking out hundreds of pounds for car insurance that in reality is worth no more than a photo shopped piece of paper.

In some cases scammers also use stolen personal information to take out policies which are then doctored before being sold on to customers.

Driving without valid insurance is easily detected by police. Uninsured drivers can have their vehicle instantly seized and are likely to receive six points on their licence.

They can also face court where they might receive an unlimited fine and a driving ban. Furthermore, an uninsured driving conviction will show on records and can affect job prospects.

If a collision is caused by the uninsured driver they may also be liable for covering the costs which can run into the thousands.

The pandemic has delayed learner drivers' gaining their license by an average of nine months

Pandemic delays learners by nine months

The problem of ghost broking could be exacerbated by the pandemic, which has led to long waiting lists for those sitting both their theory and practical tests, with a reported backlog of around 420,000 tests.

In fact, the Covid-19 pandemic delayed learner drivers' gaining their license by an average of nine months, according to research by GoCompare Car Insurance.

Lockdown restrictions meant driving lessons and driving tests were cancelled across the UK, causing chaos for thousands of learner drivers hoping to get legally on the roads.

Some 29 per cent of parents surveyed by Go Compare think the pandemic delayed their children passing their driving test by a whole year.

As a result, for some, the forced break has resulted in them giving up on plans to learn to drive altogether.

The survey of 1,000 people found 27 per cent have not returned to the driver's seat and 11 per cent are less inclined to get back in a car and learn to drive.

Separate research from the AA found the most common reason for drivers failing their test this year was observation at junctions closely followed by looking in their mirrors when changing direction and turning right at junctions.

As a result, the car insurer is urging learner drivers to ensure they are ready to take the test rather than simply booking quickly to avoid a longer wait.

Robert Cowell, AA Driving School interim managing director, said: 'Driving test slots are like gold dust right now due to an ever-growing backlog.

'As a result, learners may risk attempting a practical test before they're ready rather than face an extended wait and fail on these common test faults.

'Learning to drive is a vital life skill and it's important learners take the time to develop their experience at the right pace so they become safe, confident drivers.

'The last 18 months have created more pressures in all aspects of young people's lives and restrictions on learning to drive have added to this. The DVSA are releasing more test slots each month and we hope this will help the situation.'

Avoiding fake car insurance deals

New drivers are urged to avoid deals on social media or messaging apps and to only purchase car insurance through reputable sellers.

• If buying through an Insurance Broker they should check the seller is registered with the British Insurance brokers' Association.

• If buying directly through an insurer they should appear as a registered member of the Motor Insurers' Bureau.

• Checks can also be made to see Insurance Advisors are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Another key defence business was sold off yesterday as Babcock International offloaded a consultancy that does work on nuclear submarines and weaponry for Royal Navy warships.

The defence giant is selling Frazer-Nash Consultancy to American aerospace group KBR in a deal worth nearly £300million.

The deal will raise concerns that UK industry is rapidly losing companies and assets after the Covid crisis triggered a downturn in the aerospace sector.

Sell-off: The defence giant is selling Frazer-Nash Consultancy to American aerospace group KBR in a deal worth nearly £300m

It comes amid a wave of bids for key UK defence assets, with Meggitt and Ultra both being circled by American firms. The Government has been encouraged to step in to block the deals on national security grounds.

Frazer-Nash employs 900 people and has operations in Plymouth, Bristol and Glasgow. Its sale surprised some as it sits in the marine division of Babcock, which builds warships for the Royal Navy, including new aircraft carriers and Type 31 frigates, and which services the submarine fleet.

Frazer-Nash is also a lucrative double-digit margin consultancy. KBR will be getting a business that before the pandemic was making annual profits of £17m on revenues of £101m. The sale means Britain's second-largest defence contractor is steaming ahead with turnaround plans unveiled just two weeks ago.

Chief executive David Lockwood, who joined last year, said he was aiming to raise £400million from selling off various divisions that were less connected to its core work.

The FTSE250 company is a key contractor for the Ministry of Defence and is tasked with maintaining the UK's fleet of nuclear submarines, operating the Devonport naval dock at Plymouth and training Royal Air Force pilots.

The sale of Frazer-Nash Consultancy for £293million means Babcock has secured most of money it needs to meet its goal.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The boss of Gatwick Airport has called on the Government to remove 'unnecessary and costly' PCR testing requirements for UK holidaymakers as the group slumped to a multi-million loss.

Stewart Wingate said that, despite 75 per cent of UK adults being double-vaccinated, travel risked lagging behind the US and Europe if the Government doesn’t simplify travel rules.

It comes amid rising concerns about rip-off PCR tests costing up to £400 each, as well as unreturned or delayed results, with MPs yesterday urging the Government to cap prices for these tests at £40.

Gatwick Airport said passenger numbers were 'very low' at just 569,000 in the first half

Health Secretary Sajid Javid wrote to the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog last week, asking it to urgently investigate firms profiteering off testing requirements.

The competition watchdog responded this week, saying it was ready to take enforcement action against testing firms if it finds they are breaching consumer law.

It comes after shocking pictures of uncollected £50-a-time samples piled high outside UK pharmacies.

'Our Government needs to act now and remove unnecessary and costly PCR testing requirements for passengers, particularly for those double vaccinated,' Gatwick chief executive Wingate said.

'UK travel recovery should not be allowed to lag behind the US and Europe.

'Passengers need the travel rules simplified so they can choose to travel more freely and enjoy much needed breaks and reunions with family and friends which are currently much more attainable for those in Europe and the US.'

The company is calling on the Government to remove all tests requirements for travellers from countries on the 'green' list and for double-vaccinated travellers returning from 'amber' list countries.

Non-vaccinated people returning from 'ambe' list countries should take a single lateral flow test, Gatwick added.

It comes as the group slumped to a pre-tax loss of £204million in the first half of the year as passenger numbers were 'very low' at just 569,000 due to the impact of Covid-related international travel bans.

An overflowing Randox bin Covid test last week

While the airport has remained open throughout the first six months of the year, it said that a collapse in passenger demand and Government restrictions had hit business hard.

The company also said it was in fresh talks with banks to avoid defaulting on its loans, as after a year requesting short-term waivers on its loans, it was again facing pressure.

The business was able to save £31.3million by slashing staff costs nearly in half after it made more than 40 per cent of its employees redundant last year.

'First I would like to thank all our staff for their hard work and fortitude throughout what has no doubt been the most challenging six months the airport has witnessed with its low passenger and air traffic volumes,' Wingate said.

'I remain certain that Gatwick will recover and as a business we are financially and operationally well placed for that.'

The Texas native donned a black top as she posed with her friends at a driving range. She pulled her brunette locks into a ponytail and shielded her eyes with a pair of gold-framed sunglasses that had purple metallic lenses.

Clarkson covered her face with a colorful block print mask as she posed for a selfie with her friends. As COVID-19 cases continue to rise due to the Delta variant, the trio were all masked as they took the shot.

In her next post, Kelly wore a black cowboy hat with a feather on the cap and a leopard print top as she and her friends beamed in front of a packed arena during a George Strait concert.

She added another photo of the country music legend on stage during his performance, writing, 'Y’all, run, don’t walk to any George Strait show coming to a venue near you! He is still the #GOAT ❤️.'

Kelly, who started her career as as country singer, performed a cover of Strait's classic song You Look So Good in Love on her talk show in April.

Clarkson's vacation comes after she celebrated earlier in the week when a judge upheld the prenuptial agreement in her contentions divorce from Blackstock, 44.

And on Saturday, a report by TMZ claimed The Voice coach - who is said to be worth over £32million ($45million USD) - wants to go 'full steam ahead' in selling their Montana ranch which she owns, and where Brandon is currently residing.

Sources tell the outlet that Clarkson's attorney, famed divorce lawyer Laura Wasser, previously asked the judge for permission to sell the property, to which Blackstock's lawyers objected, with no ruling on the prenuptial agreement at the time.

Moving on: Kelly Clarkson (pictured), 39, reportedly wants to go 'full steam ahead' in selling her Montana ranch ex-husband Brandon Blackstock STILL lives in - after a judge UPHELD their prenup on Wednesday amid their bitter divorce battle

With Blackstock still living in the property, TMZ suggests Clarkson's lawyers would have to file court documents to determine conditions in which the ranch could be sold.

MailOnline has reached out to Clarkson's representatives for comment.

Clarkson had reason to celebrate on Wednesday after learning that a judge has upheld the prenuptial agreement in her bitter divorce battle with Blackstock.

Reports: Sources told TMZ on Saturday that Clarkson's attorney, Laura Wasser, previously asked the judge for permission to sell the property, to which Blackstock's lawyers objected, with no ruling on the prenuptial agreement at the time. Pictured with Blackstock in 2018

TMZ reported at the time how Clarkson was on set of The Voice when she 'let out a scream' of joy, with fellow coaches Blake Shelton and Ariana Grande joining in.

Sources told the outlet that while Clarkson was filming the singing competition, she received an email from her lawyers sharing the good news that her prenup had been kept in place, meaning she will keep the bulk of her assets and income.

Last month, Clarkson had been temporarily ordered to pay Blackstock nearly $200,000-per-month (£144,000) in spousal and child support.

The documents also revealed details into Clarkson's finances, showing that she personally earns over $2.4million (£1.8million) a month.

Reason to celebrate! Clarkson was said to have found out that her prenup with Blackstock will be upheld, while she was filming The Voice on Wednesday

TMZ reported that Clarkson will keep the lion's share of their assets including the Montana ranch where Blackstock is currently residing.

Blackstock had been contesting the prenup and wanted to split their properties 50/50, in addition to the income that she earned throughout their marriage - but a judge has reportedly stopped his request.

Sources added that Clarkson's friend and fellow coach Shelton recently cut ties with Blackstock, who had managed the country singer for a number of years.

A judge is said to have agreed with Clarkson's attorney that the signed prenup had to be taken into account.

It's over: Per reports, Clarkson has been awarded primary custody of their children - River, seven, and Remington, five (pictured above, as well as his elder kids Seth and Savannah)

Clarkson now has the right to sell the Montana ranch as she is the one who purchased it, according to the report.

The ex couple's divorce has been 'bifurcated' meaning the end of the marriage has officially been declared.

Per the report, Clarkson has been awarded primary custody of their minor children - River, seven, and Remington, five.

Earlier this week, it was reported that Clarkson would pay 70 per cent of her children's school fees and expenses but had refused to pay for the Montana ranch.

The judge had ordered that Blackstock carry the financial burden of his Montana ranch, that costs around $81,000 (£58,000) a month to run in expenses.

Cause for celebration: Blake Shelton and Ariana Grande are said to have celebrated Kelly's legal win backstage on The Voice according to a report (John Legend also pictured)

Blackstock is currently living at the ranch, and is using it as his primary residence.

Court documents obtained by TMZ confirm Clarkson will continue to pay Blackstock $150,000 (£108,000) per month whilst the divorce case continues in court as well as $45,000 (£32,000) in child support.

The permanent specifics of any spousal support is still unclear.

The singer has sold a staggering 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide in her career, and currently has her own hit talk show.

Kiss off: Earlier this month Clarkson asked for the courts to legally declare her single, over one year after she initially filed for divorce in June 2020 (pictured in 2018)

Clarkson first began dating Blackstock - a country music manager - back in 2011 and married him in 2013.

Blackstock also shares his 13-year-old son Seth and 17-year-old daughter Savannah with his ex-wife Melissa Ashworth.

The Piece By Piece hitmaker had sparked speculation last year that she and Blackstock could have been set to have a third child, as she confessed she had 'baby fever' after chatting to celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.

During their chat, in which Gordon's 13-month-old son Oscar appeared, Clarkson said: 'Oh my gosh! Do not do this to me. I so want another child, and my husband is like, 'No! We have four!'

'You get baby fever when you see them and you're like, 'Oh, I miss the chubby little legs and the little face.'

The actress, 53, told The Sunday Telegraph that production was called off in the U.S. last year as the country continued to battle the Covid pandemic.

Nicole then made the decision to relocate filming for the limited series to Australia.

'It was a hustle': Nicole Kidman, 53, (pictured) has revealed how her new TV series Nine Perfect Strangers was almost cancelled

'It was a hustle. We were fully supported by all of the actors and the government and we were able to still get the show made instead of having to shut it down, which was the other possibility,' she explained.

'For me it was the ability to get the show made... We hadn't really finalised the location so we were still kind of trying to find the right spot and we couldn't find it. And then suddenly the possibility of shooting in Byron Bay became available,' she said.

After finding the right location, Nicole revealed strict Covid safety measures had to be enforced on set.

Cast and crew members were also required to get tested for the virus regularly.

Based on the 2018 novel by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty, the eight-episode series tells the story of nine stressed-out urbanites who escape to a wellness retreat run by Nicole's character, Masha.

The show was produced by Nicole's production company Blossom Films, alongside collaborators Bruna Papandrea and David E. Kelley.

Making it happen: 'We were fully supported by all of the actors and the government and we were able to still get the show made instead of having to shut it down,' she explained

Nicole also starred in the series alongside an A-list cast, including Melissa McCarthy, Bobby Cannavale, Luke Evans and Manny Jacinto.

Jonathan Levine served as director and executive producer on all eight episodes of the limited series.

Nicole told The Daily Telegraph in July last year she was 'thrilled' to be able to bring hundreds of jobs to the local industry.

'I am thrilled we are able to make Nine Perfect Strangers in Australia,' she said.

'It is a great opportunity for me to give back to the community that nurtured me through so much of my career.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The stark North-South inheritance tax divide has been revealed by analysis showing two-thirds of estates hit by it lie in the south and east of the UK, with an average bill of £210,000.

In the 2018 to 2019 tax year, only 22,100 estates, or the equivalent of 3.7 per cent of deaths across Britain, triggered an inheritance tax bill, said NFU Mutual.

Of that tax take, 64 per cent comes from the South East, London, East of England, and South West, while a further 10 per cent comes from the East and West Midlands.

This means that all the northern regions, Wales, Scotland and Norther Ireland account for 25 per cent of the tax take.

How much? A map showing average inheritance tax bills across the country in 2018/19

The average bill on estates paying inheritance tax was up 6 per cent on the previous year.

But with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak having frozen the level at which people start paying inheritance tax for a further five years, many more are likely to fall in its scope in future, NFU Mutual has warned.

People in London had the highest inheritance tax bills in the country in 2018/19, forking out an average of £271,820, according to official figures.

The North West registered the lowest average inheritance tax bills in England, with residents in the vicinity forking out around £152,898 after the death of a loved one.

Only 252 people in Northern Ireland paid inheritance tax in the tax year in question, but had to fork out £40million between them, according to the data.

In Wales, 654 people were slapped with an inheritance tax bill in 2018/19, which came in at a total of £102million, or around £155,963.30 each.

Across Scotland, 1,190 people paid an inheritance tax bill totalling £233million over the period, forking out around £195,798.32 each.

On 3 March, Sunak froze two allowances for inheritance tax for a further five years, until 2026. This means the nil-rate band is staying put at £325,000 for the time being and the residence nil-rate band will be kept on hold at £175,000 until 2026.

Inheritance tax in brief Your estate is a combination of your property, savings, investments, other assets, wherever in the world they are held, and any gifts you give away in the seven years leading up to your death. Inheritance Tax is charged at 40 per cent on any part of an estate that exceeds individual allowances, known as the nil rate bands. The standard nil rate band is currently £325,000 per person, with no tax charged on assets left to spouses or civil partners. All of an unused nil rate band, or any unused part of it,ca n be passed on to a spouse or civil partner, so it is effectively doubled to £625,000 for couples. A further residence nil rate band is available to those who pass their home on to children or direct descendants, worth £175,000 each. The addition of this means a married couple or civil partners can pass on £1million inheritance tax-free, if they own a property worth at least £350,000. Analysts at Tilney warned there are catches: 'The allowance is tapered down for people with larger estates, reducing by £1 for every £2 that the estate is valued at over £2million. 'The residence nil rate band can only be used when passing on a residence to direct descendants and applies only to your home, not a buy-to-let property.'

The nil-rate band has been frozen at £325,000 per person since April 2009, so by April 2026 it will have remained unchanged for 17-years, during which house prices have risen sharply.

Jason Hollands, managing director at BestInvest, told This is Money: 'Had the allowance been indexed each year for consumer price inflation, it would be worth approximately £414,000 per person currently, so the impact of freezing the allowance has already been significant in real terms.

'The Chancellor’s declared freeze is therefore just extending that pain further.'

Sean McCann, chartered financial planner at NFU Mutual, said: 'Inheritance tax is feared by many but paid by relatively few.

'But with the average bill in excess of £200,000, it can make a significant dent in a family’s wealth for those that do get caught in the net.'

Mr McCann warned that more households will be caught by the inheritance tax net in future after Sunak froze the two inheritance tax thresholds to offset sky-high costs shelled out responding to the pandemic.

He said: With the tax-free allowances frozen for the next five years, rising asset prices and a heated housing market, a growing number of families will be impacted.

'It's critical that families concerned about being caught by inheritance tax seek advice as early as possible. The earlier you plan the more options you have to mitigate any potential bill.'

A recent survey by The Open Partnership found that 60 per cent of advisers expect demand for inheritance tax planning to rise over the coming year.

Speaking to This is Money, Ian Dyall, head of estate planning at Tilney, said: 'Rising property prices and any prospect of IHT reforms will be a real concern for many families, particularly for those forced to the sell homes of loved ones or other assets to pay a large inheritance tax bill.

'Fortunately, there are actions that individuals and families can consider taking now as part of their estate planning to mitigate against future changes to IHT rules.

'This could include lifetime gifting, using pensions to pass wealth on to the next generation and considering investments that qualify for Business Relief. Taking action early means more of your money going to your beneficiaries and less to the taxman.'

Radford, the swinging sixties coachbuilder best known for creating bespoke Minis for the Beatles, Peter Sellers and other celebrities, has made a comeback in 2021 - and its first new model is going to be something a little special.

Under the guise of new owners, who include 2009 F1 champion Jenson Button, TV vehicle restorer Ant Anstead and designer Mark Stubbs, it has unveiled its Radford Type 62-2 - a modernised road-legal version of the 1969 Lotus Type 62 racer.

Just 62 examples will be built and they are set to be so unique and tailored to each customer that Radford says it can't put a price on it.

Radford's reimagined racer for the road: This is the new Type 62-2, the returning coachbuilding brand's bespoke new model based on the iconic Lotus Type 62

The reborn brand showcased its plans for the boutique-built motor this weekend at the Lyon Air Museum in Orange County, California.

The supercar will be powered by a supercharged 3.5-litre V6 engine currently used in the Lotus Exige and will mark the first Radford coachbuilt creation for more than half a century.

It will be sold in three varying specifications, with the choice of levels of performance - and pricing - depending on how extreme you want your sixties racing car for the road to be.

An entry-level 'Classic' trim option comes with 430bhp and a six-speed manual gearbox.

It will be sold with forged alloy wheels - 17 inches up front and 18 inches at the rear - and use adjustable coilover suspension, Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres and AP racing brake calipers and iron discs.

There will also be a unique electronic stability programme to modulate power and grip designed by Bosch.

The entry version is called the 'Classic' and will feature the Lotus V6 engine with 430bhp and a six-speed manual gearbox

The mid-spec option is the 'Gold Leaf' will have its six-cylinder engine upgraded to 500bhp with the addition of stronger con-rods, new pistons, more aggressive camshafts, a remapped ECU and a titanium exhaust system

The three partners behind the rebirth of the Radford brand (left-to-right, Anstead, Button and Stubbs) feast their eyes on the original Type 62 Lotus racer that their new supercar pays homage to

The Gold Leaf Radford Type 62-2 will sport the iconic red-and-white livery of Graham Hill's 1968 Lotus Type 49B Formula One racer (pictured)

The mid-tier version is called the 'Gold Leaf', which will sport the iconic red-and-white livery of Graham Hill's 1968 Lotus Type 49B Formula One racer.

The six-cylinder engine will be upgraded to a more potent 500bhp output with the addition of stronger con-rods, new pistons, more aggressive camshafts, a remapped ECU and a titanium exhaust system.

Customers will get the option of a sharp-shifting seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox.

It also receives upgraded two-piece forged aluminium wheels that are an inch larger in diameter on each axle compared to those fitted to the Classic trim - though are still lighter.

A motorsport-derived traction control and ABS system - honed by Jenson Button - will also feature to control the extra engine performance.

Radford confirmed in July that it had purchased the rights to use the legendary John Player Special - or JPS - black and gold livery

The most powerful Type 62-2 is a 'JPS' version with 600bhp and the same stunning livery used on Emerson Fittipaldi's championship-winning Lotus-Ford 72D, pictured here during practice for the Grand Prix of Great Britain at Brands Hatch on 15 July 1972

Finally, the top grade examples will be the 'JPS' variants.

Having recently purchased the rights to use the legendary John Player Special black and gold livery, Radford will use the stunning scheme used on Emmerson Fittipaldi's 1972 championship-winning Lotus Type 72D F1 car for its most powerful 600bhp Type 62-2 with all the bells and whistles.

While the top-spec gets the same chassis setup as the Gold Leaf version it has even lighter carbon composite wheels, monobloc calipers and carbon ceramic brake discs.

The team behind the limited-run car promise that the V6 engine will make a decent rumble, too.

'The sound of the Type 62-2 even at idle is something really special. But when you begin to explore the rev range further up, it becomes incredible, raising the hairs on the back of your neck and putting a big smile on your face,' Button says.

'However, the unique thing about this engine is that we've kept it pure, no exhaust valves, no trickery of any kind – what you hear is uncorrupted and utterly authentic – just like every single element of the driving experience.'

Underpinning each model will be a Lotus platform, with a modified version of the bonded aluminium chassis from the Elise and Exige sports cars.

Only 62 examples of the Type 62-2 will be created, with production due to start at the end of this year and first deliveries arriving in early 2022

The bodywork will be almost entirely carbon composite while the cabin will also be wrapped in a carbon fibre roll-over crash to provide occupant protection in the event of an accident

The bodywork will be almost entirely carbon composite while the cabin will also be wrapped in a carbon fibre roll-over crash to provide occupant protection in the event of an accident.

The combination of lightweight materials means the Type 62-2 should tip the scales at around 1,000kg - which is about the same as a Volkswagen Up! city car.

That means, in the most extreme JPS guise, the 600bhp-per-tonne ratio will be better than the V8 Mclaren 675 LT (564bhp per tonne), V12 Pagani Huayra Roadster (589bhp per tonne) and even the quad-turbo W16 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse (595bhp-per-tonne).

To improve both stiffness and how well it stick to the road in the bends, Radford will fit a bespoke - and sophisticated - tubular rear subframe that is promised to be a welded piece of art that's visible from the back of the car.

Like you'd find on most race cars, the underside of the new Type 62-2 is completely flat.

This is designed to channel air towards the rear diffuser to generate downforce at high speeds.

As a result, the Classic version does without a spoiler at all, while the Gold Leaf and JPS will have just a pair of small ducktails at each rear quarter. However, the JPS example will have a larger rear diffuser and front splitter to generate more load into the tarmac.

The Gold Leaf and JPS versions will both feature small ducktail tips on the rear quarters, which mimic those featured on the original Lotus car

Radford is best known for coachbuilt cars, especially bespoke Minis in the 1960s. Left: Britt Ekland received a one-off Radford Mini from her husband Peter Sellers for her birthday in 1965. Right: John Lennon pictured in his bespoke Radford Mini

Commenting on the project, Jenson Button explained: 'Creating a car that is simultaneously luxurious and comfortable, and great to drive, is a tough challenge, but the first Radford of the modern era delivers.

'Type 62-2 is a driver's car at its heart – when you see the design, it looks just like a 70s Le Mans car. And when you sit behind the steering wheel and look through the curved windscreen, you can see the front wheel arches – something you just don't experience on road cars today.

'With such a low centre of gravity, the car's body doesn't roll. The chassis exhibits all the hallmarks of a beautifully set up race car for the road – gifting the driver supreme confidence to extract maximum enjoyment every journey.'

Radford's design will remain true to the original Lotus's compact dimensions and will stand just 1,133mm tall - that's only fractionally higher than an original Ford GT40 and makes the Type 62-2 one of the shortest models on the market.

Stood alongside the car on which it's based, you might struggle to tell them apart at first glance - that includes the like-for-like doors, which will cut into the roof panel like a sixties endurance racer.

While this is a great period feature, it could cause problematic for taller drivers to get in and out. Jeremy Clarkson famously bought a modern-era GT40 in 2005 and struggled not only to get in but also to close the doors due to the lack of headroom.

Clarkson sold the car at the RM Sotheby's Monterey sale in 2017 for $379,500, having covered just 60 miles in the supercar.

The wing mirrors look like those on the original car but feature cameras mounted inside their housings that relay live images to the driver via small screens on each A-pillar so they can see what's going on around them

The Type 62-2 will stand just 1,133mm tall, making it one of the lowest cars to enter the market in recent history. The two doors will also have sections that cut into the roof panel, just like a sixties endurance racer

Jenson Button is not only one of the owners of the revitalised Radford brand but also in charge of making sure the bespoke supercars offer the best driving experience

Modern upgrades include LED headlights - which have been designed to look like the original lamps - and a connecting LED bar between the two brake light clusters.

It also gets wing mirrors that are similar in shape to those on the original car but feature cameras mounted inside their housings that relay live images to the driver via small screens on each A-pillar so they can see what's going on around them.

Inside, Radford promises creature comforts including a five-speaker stereo, digital rear-view camera and six-inch digital instrument cluster.

For those customers intending to take their Lotus remake back to the track, there's a built in data logger and configurable displays the simplify the digital instrument cluster to show speed, gear selection and lap times for when they're hurtling around a circuit.

Each version will also be sold with an optional power nose lift system, which raised the front of the car so it can clear speed bumps and difficult angles for car parks and sloped driveways.

Customers will also get the opportunity to increase the bespoke purchase price with the addition of matching custom luggage from Mason and Sons, which slots under the front clamshell.

The returning car brand says buyers will work closely with its design team to select every element of their bespoke vehicle, from the upholstery finishes, paint colours and aero features on the bodywork.

It's for this reason it says it can't make the price of the cars publicly known.

Stubbs said: 'Coachbuilding in the modern era utterly liberates an automotive designer. Advances in technology have ushered in a new era of this historic craft, making it possible to achieve levels of quality and design never before possible and deliver them in an extremely short time.

'This enables us to evoke the spirit of an iconic car with stunning authenticity and offer owners the ultimate in customisation. However, while Type 62-2 elicits the original Type 62 Lotus hallmarks, it sets its own path as a Radford model – it's all about creating a feeling of driving something timeless. Something that doesn't look or feel like anything else on the road.'

Production of the Radford Type 62-2 begins in late 2021, with first deliveries being made in the first quarter of 2022.

Anstead added: 'Only 62 Radford Type 62 models will ever be built. No two will be exactly alike, and each will be an exceptionally rare sight on the world's roads.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Whatever you have got your sights set on this year, if it is going to involve a credit card, then it is essential that you get the right one.

The best credit cards can help you clear your debts faster, spread the cost of an expensive purchase and even earn a tidy sum in airline points, cashback or rewards.

Pick the wrong one, however, or fail to manage it correctly and you can be left with a hefty bill, and a credit rating in tatters.

So whether your plans are simply making more of your everyday spending or getting on top of existing debts to the more adventurous such as shelling out for a new Kitchen or a dream holiday - here's our pick of the best credit cards to help.

Play your cards right: This is Money has rounded up the best credit card offers

This is Money has scoured the market and picked out what we believe are the best credit card deals to help you make the most of your money.

We pick these because we think that they offer something that makes them stand out from the crowd, they may not always have the absolute lowest rate or longest special offer, but they are judged by our independent research to offer a good deal.

Do you need to clear existing debt? Before you think about signing up for a new card to use for spending, you should make sure that your existing debts are in order. If you've racked up a load of debt and have decided to make a fresh start on tackling it, zero per cent balance transfer cards could be the way to go. Moving your debt to an interest-free card means that you can freeze the size of your debt, rather than continually play catch-up as interest piles on the pounds. Make sure you stick to the rules though and clear your debt within the time period, otherwise you could be hit with high interest rates - and remember card firms offer interest-free periods because they manage to catch so many people out. The right balance transfer card for you depends on your circumstances, so rather than recommend one 'best' option here, we would instead recommend readers go to our in-depth guide to 0 per cent balance transfer cards for the best deal.

Best credit cards for spending on big purchases

Interest-free spending

If you're planning some home improvements or large purchases in the near future and need some extra cash for spending, as long as you are confident you can pay off the full amount within the interest-free period to avoid high interest rates , a 0 per cent purchase card could be a good option for you.

Remember, you will need to be disciplined about clearing the balance before the end of the term, otherwise interest on the remaining amount will quickly make it an expensive option.

Before you apply, read more about how to avoid the 0 per cent interest traps here

Could you be better with a long-term low rate instead?

If you are happy to sidestep a 0 per cent interest period, another credit card option for anyone wanting to take the pressure off paying within a set time period is a permanent low-interest card.

Unfortunately these cards are not as good as they once were, however you can still find low interest deals closer to 9 or 10 per cent, rather than the typical 19 or 20 per cent found.

These give the flexibility of knowing that you have a card to hand to spread big purchases out, without worrying about falling foul of any small print.

Protecting your money Another major bonus with rewards cards is the consumer protection you are entitled to, under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Put simply, if you use the credit card to buy something worth more than £100, here or abroad, the card issuer is equally liable if something goes wrong.

Missing payments, paying late or spending beyond your limit risk losing an interest-free term which can quickly land you in hot water when standard interest at 18 or 19 per cent is slapped on your remaining balance.

The benefit is that if you decide not to pay off the entire balance every month, you will only have to pay minimal interest.

You must have a good credit rating to be approved.

Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Tesco Bank all offer cards with an APR of 9.9 per cent, TSB 7.9 per cent and the Co-op Bank 8.9 per cent.

Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland also have the benefit of offering no-fee balance transfers.

Best credit cards for rewards

Over recent years some of the most lucrative schemes have unfortunately been scrapped or scaled back.

But there are still a few cards that if you do it right, could earn you £100s worth of goods and services for free.

Remember: Each company operates under their own points system, so make sure you check what each point is actually worth – something that may appear to offer huge bonuses could in reality be almost worthless.

Below we have picked a few of our favourites, alternatively read more about all of the top deals in our in depth guide:

Travel rewards: pay with a credit card to get deals on trips

Best for airline points: British Airways American Express Premium Plus Card

Your choice of rewards card will largely depend on which airlines you prefer because a combination of credit card and frequent flyer points are going to get you the best discounts.

However, if you are a big spender, the British Airways Premium Plus Amex card is one of the most lucrative deals on the market.

> Read our top five tips on boosting your Avios points pot without spending any more

The small-print

What it offers

Halifax demands no extra charges for spending abroad anywhere or any extra for withdrawing cash at home and abroad.

Plus it's a Mastercard which means conversion rates are much better.

There is no annual fee - so there are zero extra costs as long as you pay off your balance in full every month.

Additional cards on the same account are available and you can manage your account online.

Watch out for

Interest is charged immediately at the card's standard rate of 19.9 per cent on cash withdrawals and spending abroad, but you can minimise the cost by repaying in full as soon as possible.

Depending on your credit score, applicants may be given a higher interest rate of 27.95 per cent.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Banks could face fines or be blocked from closing branches under plans to protect cash use.

City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is reportedly considering new rules to stop banks from shutting high street branches to ensure consumers and businesses can still access cash.

It comes as more than 4,200 branches have now shut since 2015 – with 801 closing since lockdown restrictions were enforced in March last year.

Campaigners have long called for urgent action to preserve coins and notes for the millions who rely on them.

Banks could face fines or be blocked from closing branches under plans to protect cash use (stock image)

Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged to introduce laws to protect cash access last year, and last month the Treasury finally launched a consultation into how the legislation could work.

Proposals include handing the FCA powers to fine banks that shut branches where they are most needed, and the regulator may even be allowed to enforce injunctions and stop some closures from going ahead at all.

The plans could also see nine out of ten neighbourhoods given the legal right to be within 0.6 miles of somewhere they can take out cash free of charge.

The consultation will run until September 23 but any new laws could take at least two years to enforce.

Industry experts have told Money Mail that the Treasury is unlikely to view cash machines as an equal replacement to the face-to-face service branches offer.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak (pictured) pledged to introduce laws to protect cash access last year, and last month the Treasury finally launched a consultation into how the legislation could work

The consultation also aims to ensure ‘reasonable access’ to places where people can deposit cash - a service which most ATMs outside bank branches do not provide.

Gareth Shaw, head of money at consumer group Which?, says: ‘The government’s proposal to put the FCA in charge of the cash system, including holding industry accountable for providing access, is a vital step. As cash machine and bank branch numbers continue to decline sharply, the government’s legislation plans cannot be introduced soon enough.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘We know that cash remains vital for millions of people and we are committed to protecting access to cash across the UK.’

A UK Finance spokesman said growing numbers of customers were turning to new technology to manage their money, including online and mobile banking.

But he added: ‘Technology is not for everyone and bank branches continue to play an important role in the life of local communities, meaning decisions to close them are never taken lightly.’
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Share trading and investing has surged in popularity in the pandemic, with a new breed of younger investors emerging who are increasingly attracted to big name US shares.

But there's a hurdle for some: if you want to buy a single Amazon share it will cost you $3,342, about £2,400 for a UK investor, while just one Tesla share costs $713, and even a lower-priced individual Apple share costs $146.

DIY investing giant Hargreaves Lansdown revealed yesterday that it has seen a surge in younger investors, but the past 18 months has also seen business boom for upstart rival trading apps and platforms, such as Freetrade, Trading 212 and eToro.

An attractive part of the latter's offering compared to the DIY investing platform old guard is the chance for investors to snap up fractional shares: a way to back stock market juggernauts for a fraction of the cost of one share.

Investors can get a slice of expensive tech companies like Amazon, which has a share price of $3,342, or about £2,400, through fractional share trading

What is a fractional share?

Fractional share investing lets investors own a piece of a share rather than one or more whole individual stocks.

Shares trade on the stock market as whole, rather than a portion, so the way to buy or sell fractionally is through a broker, DIY investing platform or app that offers this, and not all do.

Those that do offer fractional shares enable investors to more easily invest in leading stocks with big ticket share prices like Amazon.

The advantage is that these may otherwise be out of the reach of smaller investors, or require too big a chunk of an individual's portfolio for it to remain diversified.

For example, even for someone with a £20,000 investment portfolio, holding just one $3,342 Amazon share would equate to about £2,400 - more than 10 per cent of their holdings.

How do I invest in fractional shares?

Fractional shares do not trade on the open market so investors will need to sign up to a trading platform that offers them.

The most popular platforms for fractional share ownership in the UK are eToro, Trading212 and Freetrade, which all charge zero commission on trades so fees don't eat into returns.

In contrast, the big gun DIY investing platforms Hargreaves Lansdown, Interactive Investor, AJ Bell and Fidelity don't offer fractional share ownership but do tend to have deeper investing options in terms of funds, investment trusts and ETFs.

Investors can invest in fractional and whole shares, so they could put part of their portfolio in a fraction of a share in a company with a big share price like Amazon and the rest in cheaper stocks that would allow them to buy full shares.

It gives retail investors the opportunity to have a slice of such companies, while simultaneously diversifying their portfolio.

The problem is more acute for investors in big US stock market names, particularly the tech giants, where individual share prices tend to be higher. UK fractional shares aren't as common, partly because there aren't as many bumper share price stocks listed on the London stock exchange as in the US.

How else are fractional shares created?

Investors can also own fractional shares without setting out to invest in them specifically.

This can happen through dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), stock splits and through mergers and acquisitions.

A DRIP is when a dividend-offering company or brokerage firm allows investors to use dividend payouts to purchase more of the same shares.

Because it 'drips' back into the purchase of more shares it is not limited to full shares.

A 3 for 2 stock split would create three stocks for every two an investor owns, so an investor with an odd number of shares would end up with a fractional share.

Finally, M&As may also create fractional shares if companies combine new common stock using a predetermined ratio.

TRADING PLATFORMS THAT OFFER FRACTIONAL SHARES IN THE UK eToro - $50 minimum deposit Wombat - £10 minimum deposit Trading212 - $1/€1 minimum deposit Freetrade - requires £5 minimum deposit to open an account Revolut - $1 minimum deposit. The minimum amount of shares you can buy is 0.00000001. Stake - $50 minimum deposit Nutmeg and Wealthsimple also offer investors the opportunity to buy fractional shares through ETFs.

Will I get my dividends?

If you opt for fractional shares in a company that pays dividends you will still be entitled to a portion of the payouts.

The dividends are calculated based on the portion of a share the investor owns.

If a company pays its shareholders £5 in dividends per share and an investor owns half a share, they will be entitled to £2.50.

Are fractional shares worth investing in?

Fractional share investing is a good option for investors with limited funds, or those new to investing, who would otherwise be priced out of buying shares in popular stocks.

Even for some investors with larger portfolios, it makes sense for diversification purposes.

They can also simplify the way people invest: it allows investors to allocate a sum of cash to a given company rather than try to fit a company's share price to the amount of cash you want to invest.

The question is more whether it is worth seeking out a platform that offers fractional share investing over one that doesn't. Ultimately, that will depend on your investing style and preferences - for example, if you mainly hold UK shares it is less of an issue, but if you plan to directly hold big US stocks it might be worth doing.

Many of the new trading apps also do not offer fund investing and some may not have either an Isa or a Self invested personal pension option, meaning that overall one of the more established DIY investing platforms with a wider offering may prove better. You can read our guide to DIY investing platforms here.

David Kimberley, analyst at Freetrade said: 'Fractional shares allow investors to get started with as little as £2.

'In order to grow your money, it's important that investors prioritise time in the market, rather than trying to time the market.

'With fractional shares, you have the ability to invest smaller sums across a number of companies immediately, meaning that investors can start putting their hard-earned money to work, rather than saving up over months (or years) to buy a single share of a company like Alphabet.'

However, fractional shares may prove harder to transfer to a new provider or sell and if investors don't opt for zero commission platforms, they can rack up fees that eat into returns.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The property market is one of Britain’s great soap operas, with plenty of twists and turns and heroes and villains along the way.

At the moment there is a cliffhanger: will house prices start falling?

Steady growth has been swapped for a slide towards stagnation in the headline figures, but how much does that mask a regional divide, with things looking far healthier outside of London and the commuter belt?

In this Investing Show special, Andrew Montlake of mortgage broker Coreco, joins us to discuss what’s going on in the residential property and buy-to-let markets.

He also looks at why mortgage rates are near their all-time lows despite a base rate rise and how long that could last.

Shares start the year on a strong run

The stock market has put a bad 2018 behind it and jumped at the start of 2019. Major markets in the UK and US have added between 5 and 8 per cent since the New Year, so what’s fuelling that and can it continue?

Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, joins Simon Lambert on the Investing Show to discuss it.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Gino D’Acampo’s loss-making chain of upmarket Italian restaurants had to be rescued with a £12.9million bailout even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.

The money was lent from a linked restaurant company owned by the celebrity chef’s co-investors, Iceland bosses Sir Malcolm Walker and Tarsem Dhaliwal.

It followed four years of losses totalling £7.6million. D’Acampo’s restaurant chain was founded in 2015, with an initial branch at Manchester’s Corn Exchange.

In a pickle: Celebrity chef Gino D'Acampo's restaurant chain had to be rescued with a £12.9m bailout even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit

It has since branched out to eight sites in northern England and Birmingham, promising to be ‘the best Italian in town’.

The 45-year-old’s lavishly-furnished eateries promise ‘crowd-pleasing classics inspired by my travels and what’s in season’.

Suppliers are said to be ‘hand-picked’ to ‘ensure we are getting the finest meat, vegetables, herbs and fruits from here in the UK and Italia’.

Despite the chain’s financial woes, D’Acampo appears to be expanding his empire – having launched a business venture with Spanish hotel company Melia.

The chef has opened First Street Bar and Kitchen, at Melia’s INNside hotel in central Manchester and there are plans for further restaurants at Melia hotels around the UK.

Separately, D’Acampo’s My Pasta Bar business, which has two branches in central London, is £5million in debt.

It also appears to have been bailed out by businesses controlled by Walker and Dhaliwal.

The My Pasta Bar branch in Leadenhall Market in the City was still decorated with its logos but a sign was hanging in the window, apologising for its closure until further notice due to coronavirus. An identical notice hung in the window of the Fleet Street restaurant.

A source said: ‘As to why Gino’s restaurants have lost so much money, I don’t really know.

‘I would guess the relationship between him, Sir Malcolm and Tarsem Dhaliwal is pretty fraught, given the losses and the fact he’s gone away opening these new restaurants with someone else now. The losses must have gone up even more because of the pandemic.’

Gino D’Acampo Worldwide Restaurants Limited made losses of £997,000 in 2017, £530,000 in 2018, £2.9million in 2019 and £3.1million in 2020.

Accounts for 2020 show Gino D’Acampo Worldwide Restaurants owed £12.9million to Individual Restaurants – which runs Piccolinos and The Restaurant Bar and Grill. The sum is believed to include a bank loan of £7.125million taken out in 2019.

Walker, Iceland’s founder and executive chairman, controls Individual Restaurants along with Dhaliwal, managing director of the frozen food supermarket chain.

Despite small annual operating profits of around £2million, exceptional items resulted in Individual Restaurants Limited making pre-tax losses of £10.2million over three years between 2017 and 2019. It has not yet filed accounts for 2020.

The company, which has more than 40 branches, was subject of a pre-pack administration deal last November.

It was bought by another firm controlled by Walker and Dhaliwal and its head office moved to Iceland’s headquarters in Flintshire, North Wales.

Steven Walker, managing director of Gino D’Acampo Worldwide Restaurants and Individual Restaurants – who is no relation of Sir Malcolm – said: ‘The restaurants have been trading well since they reopened.’

He said the £12.9million bailout was simply ‘a transaction within the group’.

D’Acampo is the sole director of his pasta bar business. The company, The Pasta Bar Specialists, has borrowed heavily.

Its 2019 accounts reveal £4million of loans from Steven Walker, Gino D’Acampo Worldwide Restaurants and The Restaurant Bar and Grill. Walker and Dhaliwal did not wish to comment. D’Acampo did not respond to requests for comment.

Mainstream television

At the tail-end of the 2019-20 season, with football being played behind close doors because of the pandemic, some live Premier League action was shown on the BBC for the first time.

However, this won't continue - instead, fans happy to wait to watch the highlights will have to wait for Match of the Day on a Saturday evening, or Match of the Day 2 on the Sunday.

What about bums on seats?

Many fans will be chomping at the bit to get back to stadiums and watch their team live in action, after nearly a year and a half away.

With restriction rules relaxed, stadiums can be at full capacity once more - although, from October, there are expected to be rule changes for grounds with 20,000-plus capacity, which could include a proof of being vaccinated or a 'vaccine passport.'

A statement last month from the Premier League said: 'Fans have been hugely missed… we are looking forward to full stadiums in the 2021/22 season.

'As we move towards a Government decision on Step 4 of the roadmap and beyond, we will continue to work with football stakeholders and relevant public authorities to ensure that the return to full capacity is done in a way that keeps everyone safe.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When estate agency group Belvoir unveiled its 2019 figures on March 30, 2020, Britain had just entered into its first lockdown and chief executive Dorian Gonsalves said he thought Covid-19 would have a significant effect on trading for the rest of the year, so much so that the final dividend was axed.

In the event, Gonsalves – and Belvoir's shareholders – were pleasantly surprised. The company proved far more resilient than anyone had hoped.

Revenues and profits rose substantially, the dividend was reinstated and the company continued to expand organically and through acquisition.

Growth has continued at pace ever since. Last week, Gonsalves said first-half revenues were 41 per cent higher than in 2020 and 53 per cent ahead of 2019, driven by strong demand across every part of the business.

On the move: Soaring demand for new homes has boosted revenues for estate agency Belvoir

Belvoir differs from many peers because it operates a franchise model, with 243 franchisees effectively acting as small businesses, supported by Gonsalves and his team.

This makes the group nimbler and more entrepreneurial than many large property firms, a particular bonus during the ups and downs of the pandemic.

The company also derives around 90 per cent of its revenues from rentals, rather than sales.

Commercial property landlords have had a tough time during the pandemic, as tenants suffered from closures and lockdowns. But the residential rental market held its own.

Belvoir suffered from virtually no arrears last year and in the first half of this year, underlying rental revenues rose 10 per cent, with further strong growth expected through 2021 and beyond.

On the sales side, Belvoir has benefited from soaring demand for new homes, as people rush to find larger properties more in keeping with flexible working lifestyles.

Headquartered in Grantham, Lincolnshire, the company is well located too, with a strong presence in the Midlands and the North, where activity has been buoyant for both sales and rentals.

Belvoir derives around 90 per cent of its revenues from rentals, rather than sales

In recent years, Belvoir has moved into financial services as well, offering mortgage advice through 242 independent advisers. In June, this business was bolstered with the acquisition of Nottingham Building Society's mortgage advice division.

A small deal right now, this should drive future growth, as the building society has been building a name for itself in the Lifetime ISA space, with savers likely to turn to Belvoir's advisers when they want to use their cash to buy a home.

Brokers expect that group revenues for 2021 will climb by 25 per cent to £27million, with profits rising at a similar pace to £9.3million. Belvoir is a decent dividend payer too.

The dividend for 2020 was 7.2p and this year, 7.4p is forecast, although that may well increase if the group continues to exceed expectations.

Midas recommended Belvoir in 2016 when the shares were £1.21 and we looked at the business again just before the first lockdown, by which time, the price had risen to £1.78. It slumped to below 100p in March last year but has since soared to £3.

Brokers believe there is further to go and Gonsalves is certainly optimistic, actively seeking acquisitions and helping franchisees to expand as well.

Midas verdict: Belvoir shareholders have been well rewarded and may choose to reduce their holdings, now that the price has reached £3.00. But they should retain at least 50 per cent of their stock.

Belvoir is well positioned to benefit from continued demand for new homes, the financial services business should accelerate growth and the dividend offers a decent income too.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Kirsti Overton and her partner Chris Penfold bought their £150,000 three-bedroom flat, they were over the moon finally to own a home together. But five years on, they have been forced to sell up because their service charges have nearly tripled.

A Money Mail investigation today reveals how some firms appointed to manage properties are cashing in while leaseholders are seeing bills soar to unaffordable levels.

There are also fears that residents are being hit with rising charges by mistake. Some firms have been forced to refund residents tens of thousands of pounds after charges were found to be unjustified or made in error.

Forced to sell up: Chris Penfold and Kirsti Overton

Kirsti and Chris first paid £1,473 a year to cover costs associated with the block of 25 apartments in Newcastle upon Tyne. Fast-forward to 2021 and their manage-­ ment agent, Kingston Property Services, has now said they must pay £4,140 — more than eight times the cost of their monthly mortgage. Kirsti, 33, says: ‘We have never been able to save anything because we are always having to pay these bills. It’s so stressful not knowing how high they could end up in the future.’

But estate agents have warned the couple that they may not be able to find a buyer willing to take on the high fees. Experts say rip-off service charges levied by unregulated firms could be the next scandal to blight the housing market. The Leasehold Advisory Service, which offers free legal advice, says one in four inquiries are about costly service charges.

EVER HIGHER VARIABLE COSTS

Service charges are supposed to go towards maintaining the building and any communal areas, such as the garden or car parks. In some developments, water rates and building insurance premiums may also be covered. Luxury apartment blocks may also expect residents to foot the bill for concierge staff, swimming pools and gyms. Charges usually range between £1,000 and £2,000 a year.

Fees totalling more than £5,000 a year would be considered excessive, according to property experts at HomeOwners Alliance. Landlords typically employ managing agents to look after properties and collect service charges from the leaseholders. In the past fees were usually fixed, but today more leases now allow for ‘variable’ charges, which mean fees can be increased to cover rising costs and inflation. Experts warn that unscrupulous firms are hiking fees to rake in extra profit.

Amelia Murray purchased a flat with her brother three years ago. But she says: 'We never would have gone ahead had we known what a costly nightmare we faced dealing with the building’s managing agent'

Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, says: ‘Leaseholders remain at the mercy of their free-­ holders and their managing agents and continue to be used as an end-­ less cash cow. We know our homes need maintenance but having no control over these costs is like writing a blank cheque.’

Paula Higgins, chief executive of consumer group HomeOwners Alliance, says buyers of newbuild properties are at particular risk. She adds: ‘Developers can set service charges unrealistically low to tempt buyers into going through with a purchase. Once a managing agent takes control of the development, it will usually hike the fees to meet actual costs.’

Generous commission paid out to brokers for home insurance is also driving up the cost of premiums for leaseholders. Harry Scoffin, of the charity the Leasehold Knowledge Partner-­ ship, says: ‘Average commissions of around 40 per cent of a leaseholder’s premium is a common consumer grievance in the sector. ‘And there is no law that compels the freeholder or broker to reveal this information to the leaseholder who foots the bill.’

HOW THE BILLS QUICKLY ADD UP

In Kirsti and Chris’s case, the cause of the rising bills appears to be down to huge increases in the amount of money the firm has spent on repairs, increasing from £3,801 in their first year to an estimated £8,000 needed for 2021. Jobs include servicing floors, lights, windows and fixing leaks in the red-brick listed building. Residents also pay into a ‘reserve fund’, which is for more expensive jobs such as replacing a roof.

But while they contributed £5,000 in 2016, they are now being asked to pay in £14,500. Other costs include a £5,135 annual cleaning bill and a £495 accountancy fee. The firm also charges a management fee to cover its own services and staff. This has risen by 10 per cent to £6,775 since they moved in.

Andy and Siobhan Masterson, both 50, used to pay £800 a year for their two-bedroom flat in Sutton, Surrey, but since the freehold was purchased by another landlord their fees have soared to £3,509. New agent Eagerstates has commissioned more than £10,000 of work — and each time a job costs leaseholders more than £250, it charges a 15 per cent management fee. Eagerstates says it had to ‘pick up the slack’ left by the previous agent to ‘bring the property up to date and compliant with laws’.

How I plotted escape Amelia Murray: My brother and I bought a flat together three years ago. But we never would have gone ahead had we known what a costly nightmare we faced dealing with the building’s managing agent. The first bill arrived months after we moved in. There are two flats in the building and between us we were billed £7,717 for ‘external decorating’ - including a £1,177 management fee. When we asked local builders for quotes, they came in at less than half the cost. Yet we paid out the money and wrote it off as a bad experience. But the bills kept coming and over the next few months we and our neighbours were each invoiced £467 for an asbestos survey we did not need, £400 for a fire safety check and £400 for a fire safety sign. We were also charged £1,493 a year for buildings insurance. So we decided to take matters into our own hands and ask to buy the freehold for the building, which meant we could organise any work needed ourselves. But we were told we would have to pay a £420 fee just to get a response from the firm. Alternatively, we could apply for the Right To Manage (RTM). Under the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, leaseholders can replace their management company with themselves or another firm. The Leasehold Advice Centre helped us prepare and serve notices, complete title searches and register the RTM. It took five months and cost £834. We still pay annual ground rent but have more than halved our insurance cost and are no longer on the hook for any more shock demands.

A Kingston Property Services spokesman says the building’s age means more needs to be spent on repairs and saved for future works. He adds: ‘The management fee is fixed and therefore unaffected by the amount of works commissioned for the building.’

NEXT CHAPTER OF THE SCANDAL?

It is not the first time Britain’s 4.5 million leaseholders have felt exploited by profit-hungry businesses. For years, they have been forced to pay punitive ground rents to firms that own the land their home is built on. In January, after a Daily Mail campaign to end toxic leaseholds, ministers pledged to scrap the archaic charges for millions. The new rules followed an investigation by the Competition & Mar-­ kets Authority (CMA), which uncovered ‘troubling evidence’ of potentially unfair terms and misselling. Housing developer Persimmon has since agreed to sell free-­ holds to leaseholders at a discounted price. Aviva said it would refund up to 1,000 families whose ground rent bills had doubled.

Pressure is now piling on other developers and investment firms that bought freeholds to follow suit. But leaseholders are still not protected against sky-high service charges. The CMA said it had received complaints about costs rapidly escalating and home­owners billed for work not carried out. It warned: ‘A service charge should be compensatory, rather than a means of making a profit.’

In September 2020, the CMA said: ‘The wide variety and high cost of these charges can often take homeowners by surprise and leave them feeling vulnerable, frustrated and exploited in their own homes.’ Cross-party peer Lord (Richard) Best co-wrote a report with industry professionals in 2019 calling for management agents to be licensed and unscrupulous firms fined.

He says: ‘We urgently need a regulator because people just don’t know the score about these firms. Leaseholders have nowhere to go if something goes wrong.’

But ministers are yet to introduce new laws on service charges and, until then, the CMA cannot address the issues it has identified. Yet in Scotland managing agents, known as property factors, are regulated. Leaseholds are also banned in Scotland and residents in a block of flats can vote to fire a factor if they wish.

BATTLE OVER BOTCHED BILLS

Bungling firms have also been billing homeowners incorrectly — leading to some residents winning back tens of thousands of pounds. Last week the Financial Times revealed widespread errors in how service charges are calculated by major housing firms. Insurance giant Aviva has agreed to refund leaseholders of a luxury central London development more than £300,000, the newspaper reported.

Yet residents, who trawled through documents to find they had been billed £200,000 for Christmas lights over three years, say they have found more than £2million in possible charge errors over five years. Meanwhile, Optivo, one of the UK’s largest housing associations, admitted residents of its over-55s block in Kidbrooke Village, SouthEast London, had been over-­ charged by £20,000 a year for gas and agreed to refund them a total of £143,000.

Roger Edwards and his neighbours spent hours checking bills from One Housing Group (OHG), which is landlord to more than 35,000 people. The 64-year-old lawyer and his partner Paula Edwards, 49, bought their new-build two-bed-­ room flat in Wandsworth, SouthWest London, for £440,000 in 2015. And in 2016, the block of 31 flatowners received an estimated service bill of £37,573. But OHG ended up charging them £51,319.84 for the year of which Roger had to pay £1,796.

So Roger and his neighbours got together to ask OHG for con-­ tracts, invoices and receipts on a variety of expenses including CCTV maintenance, rubbish collection and repair jobs. After fail-­ ing to provide receipts for materials purchased for work, the company agreed to credit them with refunds totalling more than £11,500. The firm agreed to refund another £14,000 after further challenges of the 2019 accounts.

Roger and his neighbours have since taken over their bills and appointed a new managing agent after successfully applying for Right To Manage. He says: ‘By the end of it we had completely lost trust in the company, which at best was clearly incompetent.’

In 2019, OHG had to refund 12 residents £246 after it charged them for maintaining a nonexistent lift for nine years. At the time it apologised for the errors on the bills for the block in Reading, Berkshire. It is understood bulkbought products made it difficult for OHG to provide receipts. Its chief operating officer Chyrel Brown says: ‘Our service charges are based on reasonable costs incurred and there are clear mechanisms for leaseholders to query or dispute them. We apologise for any errors that have occurred.’

When David Watson moved into his one-bedroom flat in Camber-­well, South London, in 2016, he was paying £118 a month to housing association London & Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q). But the fees have been hiked every year since. By April they had more than doubled to £320.98. The company wrote to residents to say it would be hiking cleaning costs after re-measuring their communal areas, before admitting these bills should have been capped at £100 all along and that the letters had been sent in error. Yet even after receiving a £1,304.20 refund, David, 41, says: ‘We feel like we are stuck with a company which is failing to check how it is spending other people’s money.’

An L&Q spokesman says: ‘We have refunded leaseholders for charges above this cap, and are writing to them to apologise for our error, explain what happened and put things right.’ Optivo says it became aware of inconsistencies when it took over the block in 2017 and that it has addressed them with a ‘lengthy and thorough review’. Aviva disputes the £2million figure, but confirmed it had refunded leaseholders after ‘historic service charge errors by the estate’s managing agents’ were identified.

It is not the first time Britain’s 4.5 million leaseholders have felt exploited by profit-hungry businesses

OWNERS CAN TAKE CONTROL

Leaseholders must be offered the chance to find a cheaper quote but agents are not obliged to go with a different option. There is not a free ombudsman resolution service for leaseholders seeking to challenge service charges. But leaseholders can take their landlords to the FirstTier Tribunal (Property Chamber) if they believe the fees are not ‘reasonable’.

You can also apply to the tribunal to appoint a different managing agent. Your case will be heard by a panel, which may assess whether the agents are in serious breach of conduct set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. But there is a minimum £300 fee. You may have to foot your landlord’s legal bills if you don’t win.

Another option is to submit a notice to the First-Tier Tribunal of an intention to buy a share of the freehold so you can manage the property with your neighbours. But you will need to get at least half of the other leaseholders on board and hire a surveyor to value the price of your share. And a landlord can serve a counter-notice, which can result in a lengthy and costly process.

Anna Scoffin’s service charge bills have soared by more than £10,000 in the past eight years, from £16,426 a year when the building was under a previous agent to £26,520 today. But she cannot legally buy her freehold share because a business takes up more than 25 per cent of her Canary Wharf skyscraper. Anna, 55, says: ‘It’s a horrific situation when you’re faced with spiralling charges.’

A cheaper option is Right to Manage. Again, you need at least half of your neighbours to agree and a solicitor to help you send notice to your landlord of your intention. If the firm tries to block your request, you go to the FirstTier Tribunal. The Government also wants to make it easier for leaseholders to become commonholders, which would allow them to look after their own blocks.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The mini-housing boom has seen the average price of a home in Britain rise around £24,000 during the past year to almost £245,000.

But this doesn't mean to say that it isn't still possible to find a bargain if you're currently on the lookout for your next home to buy.

We have found some examples on property website Zoopla of homes that cost less than a fifth of the typically priced British home.

You may need to compromise on location or condition, but the relatively low price tag may be enough to tempt you to take a closer look.

We reveal four homes for sale with price tags of £40,000, including this four-bedroom detached house in the Scottish Highlands (scroll down for more details)

Tom Parker, of Zoopla, said: 'The property market is enjoying a once-in-a-generation boom but that doesn't mean there aren't bargains to be had if you look hard enough.

'While you won't often get the finished article for £40,000 there's plenty of properties with ample opportunity to be improved if you have the money and imagination.'

It comes after the average value of a home in Britain was revealed to have risen by around £24,500 between July last year and the end of June this year.

Nationwide said that the average cost of a home now stands at £244,229, although this is a drop from £245,432 in June, following the end of the stamp duty holiday.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: 'Buyers had rushed to complete deals before the deadline, with the number of housing market transactions soaring to a record high of almost 200,000 in June, which is around twice the typical monthly number before the pandemic.'

All of the selected properties are in the North and Scotland, and some need updating.

But two have the benefits of being moments from the sea, an unexpected perk that is likely to appeal to house hunters amid the pandemic - especially when the price tag only reads £40,000.

Here are pick of homes with price tags of £40k…

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The finance watchdog has admitted that the number of 'mortgage prisoners' across the UK may exceed previous estimates.

Mortgage prisoners are borrowers who took out high-interest home loans with lenders such as Northern Rock, which collapsed during the 2008 financial crash.

Trapped in a catch-22 situation thanks to mortgage lenders' rules (see factbox below), they have been paying eye-watering interest rates of up to 9 per cent, in some cases for more than a decade.

Trapped: Mortgage prisoners took out high-interest loans pre-financial crisis and find it difficult to remortgage due to stricter affordability criteria, debt and negative equity

The Financial Conduct Authority has previously said that there are 250,000 mortgage prisoners, but the review will interrogate that figure.

In the terms of reference the FCA has set out, it said: 'We believe that our July 2020 assumptions led to a low estimate of the number of customers who have mortgages with inactive firms and are unable to switch despite being up to date with payments.

'We expect that the change in economic conditions, more recent data and updated assumptions are likely to lead to an increase in our estimated number of mortgage prisoners.'

The review was announced by Economic Secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, in April 2021.

It happened as he led the opposition to a House of Lords amendment to the Financial Services Bill, which proposed capping the standard variable interest rates that mortgage prisoners could be charged, therefore reducing their monthly bills.

The amendment was not passed, as 355 Conservative MPs voted against it.

Rachel Neale, who founded the UK Mortgage Prisoners Action Group, said borrowers were frustrated that the FCA review was only happening now, after the old figures were used in the debate over the potentially life-changing amendment.

What is a mortgage prisoner? Mortgage prisoners took out high-interest home loans before the financial crisis, with lenders that subsequently collapsed. The most high-profile example is Northern Rock. Their mortgages were then put into a Government holding company, which sold the loans on to investment funds, for example Cerberus. Their loans are currently held under brands such as Heliodor, Landmark and NRAM. These companies do not offer new mortgages, so remortgaging with them is not possible. Other lenders will rarely accept mortgage prisoners because they adjusted their affordability requirements post-financial crisis and they now do not qualify. Some have also fallen into arrears due to their high payments. This leaves them trapped on default 'standard variable' interest rates as high as 9 per cent, meaning they have paid tens of thousands more than mainstream mortgage customers at a time when wider interest rates have fallen to rock-bottom levels. As a result, they say they have suffered financial hardship, but also emotional distress including mental health problems and family breakdowns.

'There are so many people who have contacted us and said the SVR cap decision just crushed us,' she said.

'Now [The FCA] is admitting that all of the figures that they have produced in the past have been produced on assumptions.

'Everything [The FCA and John Glen] have done has misled the whole situation, it has misled the way people have voted for solutions that have been put through and it has completely damaged mortgage prisoners.'

Neale believes the true number of mortgage prisoners resulting from the financial crash could be closer to 300,000.

She also said that a new cohort of mortgage prisoners was being created due to the cladding scandal, which is making homes unsaleable and impossible to remortgage in some cases.

This is in addition to the pandemic, which has seen people on furlough and who have taken government support grants for the self-employed be turned down for remortgages and fall on to higher standard variable rates.

Neale said these cases should also be taken into account in the review.

'Everything has been created by the Government and the banking industry. They are the only two that can resolve all those issues because they are the ones that created the problem,' she added.

Neale is also concerned that FCA's intention to 'update [the] data to consider the demographic and loan characteristics of mortgage prisoners' could result in some mortgage prisoners, for example those who have fallen into arrears as a result of high interest rates, being unfairly stigmatised.

'The huge worry with this review, which is why we never wanted it to be done, is that they want to create a narrative that victimises and plays a blame game,' she said.

The UKMPAG will meet with the FCA next month to discuss the review.

The cap proposed by the Lords amendment would have been no more than 2 percentage points above the Bank of England's base rate, which would currently make it 2.1 per cent, and the UKMPAG said it could have saved some of its members £800 a month.

Sky high: Some mortgage prisoners pay interest of up to 9 per cent (picture posed by model)

Speaking in the Commons, Glen cited Financial Conduct Authority analysis which, he said, showed that half of mortgage prisoners would be eligible to switch mortgages if they chose to.

He also said the SVR cap would be 'deeply unfair' to borrowers in the mainstream mortgage market who were in arrears or unable to secure a new fixed-rate deal, as they would not be able to benefit from the same interest rate reduction.

Glen promised that the Treasury would work with the FCA on a new solution for mortgage prisoners, of which the review is part.

The review will also report on the effectiveness of the 'modified affordability assessment,' a Government intervention which was supposed to make it easier for mortgage prisoners to remortgage with active lenders.

The policy has been in place since October 2019, and means lenders can choose not to ask for evidence of a customer's income and expenses, or apply a stress test.

However, this is not compulsory on the part of the lender, and the UK MPAG says many mortgage prisoners are not able to benefit.

The Treasury has promised to work with lenders and regulators to find 'practical and proportionate' solutions to the high interest rates paid by mortgage prisoners

In April, it said that it was only aware of 40 borrowers that had benefited from this.

The FCA review will be laid before parliament by the end of November this year.

In a statement, the Treasury has said that after the review is published it will work with lenders and regulators to 'Look for practical and proportionate solutions to help as many affected borrowers as possible switch to an active lender, should this be the customer's wish.'

This, it said, could include taking advantage of the modified affordability assessment, 'offering additional flexibility around other aspects of the underwriting process', or taking other steps to reduce the barriers that prevent borrowers from switching to a better deal.

Separately, The UKMPAG is now launching the Home Ownership Protection Enterprise, a mediation service which aims to provide an 'end-to-end open communication channel between mortgage providers, local authorities and homeowners when homelessness is likely as a result of repossession.'

Another way that mortgage prisoners may be able to get help is by bringing legal action against the private companies that now control their loans.

The law firm Harcus Parker is currently working with some mortgage prisoners in order to pursue such claims, but the process is at an early stage.

The FCA and Treasury have been contacted for comment.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Whoever knew that Stock Spirits, the vodka distiller beloved by boozers across Eastern Europe, is quoted in London?

It is among a bunch of firms from the newly-capitalist economies which saw the City as an attractive place to float.

They reckoned without the London discount, which has made the UK a honey-pot for private equity barons.

Feeding frenzy: London-listed vodka distiller Stock Spirits has become the latest target for the private equity barons

Hard on the heels of a bid for Czech-based cyber-security Group Avast by America's Norton Life Lock, comes a £1billion offer by CVC for Stock with a decent 41 per cent-plus premium.

CVC is on a roll. It is involved in a messy battle in Spain for control of La Liga, but encountering resistance from its two most garlanded members, Real Madrid and Barcelona. It controls Formula One and did a strategic deal with Six Nations Rugby during the pandemic.

The words around CVC's deal with Stock are familiar. CVC is going to be investing in its 'strong track record of product innovation' and tap into the popularity of its brands among millennials. In other words, getting a lot of young people drunk.

As wonderful as that may be for the directors and shareholders, they should consider downsides. Loading up companies with debt is never a good idea, especially in a turbulent pandemic age. And, as colleagues at Avast and Norton are learning, the easiest way to jump-start margins is to sack people.

In a report on the summer madness, broker Peel Hunt points out that 12 UK public companies have come under offer since July. The most high-profile is the botched bidding war for supermarket Morrisons.

The most vexing is the undermining of the UK's aerospace capacity with the deals for Meggitt and Ultra Electronics.

And the least desirable is the offer for inhaler developer Vectura from Philip Morris. It has the medical establishment up in arms, including the Royal College of Physicians.

What also is clear from the Peel Hunt note is that private equity need have no fear of rejection as almost every deal is 'recommended'.

The idea that 'nodding dog' independent directors should ever get in the way of grasping executives becoming instant multi-millionaires through share incentive plans is alien.

As strong results from investment banks Barclays and Goldman Sachs – along with professional services such as PwC – demonstrate, everyone in finance has an abiding interest in getting deals over the line.

The broader interest of stakeholders, employees, suppliers and consumers or the nation, doesn't stand a chance against financial muscle.

Cashing out

No one could accuse Aviva boss Amanda Blanc of dragging her heels. In her 12 months in charge of the insurer, she has executed £7.5billion of disposals and is now dishing out the largesse with plans to give £4billion back to investors.

The first £750m is going on a share buyback. That will tidy up a sprawling equity base. But unless the company can find a winning formula to grow and to keep earnings and shares rising, then investors may feel cheated.

They will hope that as the rest of the cash is released over the next year, most of it will come as a special dividend. Aviva's balance sheet clean-up, including paying down £2billion of debt, and £300million in cost reductions should go some way to keeping Swedish activist investor Cevian at bay.

Blanc's next task will be making sure Aviva can keep growing in an increasingly digital sector. Disrupters such as newcomers Marshmallow pride themselves on undercutting incumbents.

The legacy of a strong advisers network also means Aviva is able to attract inflows into investment products. But the disruption of traditional channels by fintech upstarts could make that harder.

If the longer-term goal is a more progressive dividend, it might have been worth keeping some of the cash back for transformative, long-term investment in tech and marketing channels. That's not on the activist agenda.

Social justice

The Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) says it has no role in policing Britain's food security at Morrisons. But it can't resist poking the social media giants.

A preliminary ruling that Facebook's acquisition of online image creator Giphy raises serious concerns is gutsy, since the target company has no direct presence in the UK.

Facebook control could potentially deprive other platforms of the right to access animated images known as GIFs.

A fascinating intervention, but couldn't the CMA unleash its anti-trust enforcers closer to home?
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Average asking prices for homes fell for the first time in 2021 in the last month, new data from Rightmove has revealed, amid the ending of the primary phase of the stamp duty holiday.

Property price tags have fallen an average £1,076 since mid-July - or 0.3 per cent - driven by a 'cooling' at the higher end of the market, according to the website.

The typical asking price for a home across the country stands at £337,371, down from £338,447 in July.

At the top of the property ladder, average asking prices have slipped by nearly £4,700 in the last few weeks, to £616,421.

Shifts: A chart showing average property asking prices in Britain since August 2020

Mapped: A map showing what's happening to property prices around the country

On an annual basis, average asking prices are still 5.6 per cent higher than they were a year ago, down slightly on the 5.7 per cent increase the previous month.

'Our analysis shows that average prices have only fallen in the upper-end sector, which is usually more affected by seasonal factors such as the summer holidays and has also seen the greatest withdrawal of stamp duty incentives', Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said.

He said stamp duty holiday savings were now typically no more than £2,500, adding that the window to take advantage of this saving by buying now and completing by the end of September has 'pretty much closed.'

Buyers now have to pay for stamp duty on purchases above £250,000, down from the £500,000 threshold during the main phase of the tax holiday.

During the pandemic, many prospective buyers have been on the hunt for a property with more outdoor space, and recent figures from Halifax last week suggest that the price of a detached house has risen by around £46,000 in a year.

Trends: A chart showing five-year average asking price trends

Rightmove said the number of homes coming up for sale remained at 'record lows', with buyers often battling to buy the same property.

While asking prices in the upper end of the market appear to have cooled, the 'mass-market' of homes for first-time buyers and second-steppers has held firm, the data suggests.

For first-time buyers, average asking prices have jumped by 3.7 per cent in the past few weeks, hiking the price tag from £207,386 to £208,714.

And, for people buying their second property, average property price tags have risen by 6.6 per cent to £309,643 in the past year, up from £308,668 a year ago.

Rightmove thinks there will be a further 'autumn bounce' in both seller activity and property prices in the coming months, with the chance of finding a buyer 'at, or close to, an all-time high.'

The time taken for a home to be 'sold subject to contract' was now just 36 days, Rightmove added.

It said buyer enquiries were still 56 per cent higher than by the same point back in 2019, and down 17 per cent from the 'frenzied' post-lockdown 2020 numbers.

The data showed that the number of sales agreed was 9 per cent higher than back at the same point in 2019.

Mr Bannister said: 'Sell before you buy is a successful tactic in fast moving markets, especially the current one where any new listings popular in both specification and location are selling in days rather than weeks.'

He added: We also anticipate that more property will come to market when future when owners have more clarity over their employers' long-term balance of home and office working.'

Toby Philips, managing director of Countrywide, said: 'The UK property market continues to defy expectation, with houses continuing to sell faster than ever.

'Although we're seeing glimmers of a downturn in house prices as a result of the tapered stamp duty holiday deadline, we're seeing this predominately in the premium end of the market.

Price tags: Percentage monthly change in average asking prices over time

'Across out Southern region in particular we're seeing a continued surge in the volume of new buyers looking to purchase the limited housing stock available.

'This is creating a fast moving, favourable market for sellers. We can see little sign of this abating and would go as far as predicting an Autumn bounce in prices if buyer demand continues as it is.'

He added: 'At Bairstow Eves, we've never seen a seller's market quite like this.'

Nick Barnes, head of research at Chestertons, said: 'August tends to be a quieter month but, in line with Rightmove’s analysis, buyer interest has remained strong and sales in the first half of August were 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.

'Chestertons also noted a 45 per cent reduction in the number of properties coming onto the London market, which inevitably creates competitive market conditions.

''As a result, we have seen a 49 per cent decrease in the number of sellers willing to drop their asking prices during the first half of August 2021 compared to this time last year.'

But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Holly Willoughby, Olivia Colman and Dame Helen Mirren, who have all appeared in the past, will be absent from this year’s campaign – and a top American model and activist will take on the lead role instead.

Colorado-born Madisyn Ritland, 32, a former catwalk star for US lingerie company Victoria’s Secret, has been signed up for the advert, which will hit screens from November.

Being a quintessentially British brand, Marks & Spencer has traditionally hired homegrown talent for its Christmas adverts. But Holly Willoughby will be absent from this year’s campaign

Colorado-born Madisyn Ritland, 32, a former catwalk star for US lingerie company Victoria’s Secret, has been signed up for the advert, which will hit screens from November

Her previous jobs also include modelling for Chanel, Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana, and leading a 2018 campaign for Italian drinks brand Martini.

As well as holding down a modelling career, Miss Ritland has transformed herself into an activist, setting up her own New York-based modelling agency, The Lions, to fight against models being mistreated.

She is also vice-president of a campaigning organisation called the Model Alliance to fight for the rights of those working in the industry.

The staunch feminist is vocal in America’s Time’s Up movement, which was set up to support victims of sexual harassment.

In 2018, she found herself in a war of words with US reality star Kendall Jenner, who in an interview said she is ‘super-selective’ about the catwalk shows she takes part in, adding: ‘I was never one of those girls who would do, like, 30 shows a season or whatever the f*** those girls do.’

A furious Miss Ritland hit back, saying: ‘Not everyone is a social media titan and reality TV show royalty – a lot of people have to use other means. I took it personally. I got defensive of all my friends who work so hard.’

She also accused Victoria’s Secret photographer Karl Templar of forcibly kissing her, prompting him to reply: ‘I’ve never abused my power or position. I never forced any model to do anything.

‘I always took the Victoria’s Secret girls to my editorial work to make the brand look more modern.’

M&S brand ambassador Holly appeared a cosy yellow pom-pom jumper and tartan mini skirt in the company's 2018 Christmas advert

The M&S campaign, which insiders say is expected to be ‘much more glossy and high-end’ than those of recent years, will be directed by American Autumn de Wilde. She was behind last year’s Oscar-nominated big-screen adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma.

She and Miss Ritland are understood to be friends – de Wilde directed the 2018 Martini advert. They also regularly comment on one another’s social media platforms.

The M&S campaign, which was filmed last week at a West London studio, comes just months after the high street giant formed a new in-house marketing communications team.

M&S said it was designed to give the retailer a more hands-on approach to its creative projects.

Huge rivalry has emerged in recent years as top chains compete for the most talked about Christmas campaigns, with Marks & Spencer and John Lewis often vying for the top spot.

Since it began making big-budget adverts in 2007, John Lewis has featured soundtracks by pop stars such as Sir Elton John.

M&S declined to comment.

The Monster's Ball star smiled softly as the wind lifted up strands of her golden-streaked brown tresses.

Last month, Berry gushed over her relationship with Hunt in an Instagram post in which she promoted a new cocktail collaboration.

'As you might know, I have a boyfriend, finally - I have a really good boyfriend, I have my person,' Halle said a clip in which she wore a black tank top and patterned head scarf.

Berry went on to say, 'When you find your person, you like to try to find things you can enjoy together,' adding that she and Van enjoy drinking wine and sipping bourbon, inspiring her collaboration, The Berry Blend.

The beverage includes blueberries, lemon, lime, orange, strawberries, pineapple, jalapeño and vegan sugar, infused with a blend of alcohol, which Berry describes as a 'sweet and spicy sensation.'

The Cleveland native last fall confirmed her romance with Hunt on social media and the pair walked the red carpet at the Oscars this past April.

Berry is mom to daughter Nahla, 13, with ex Gabriel Aubry, and son Maceo, seven, with ex-husband Olivier Martinez. She was past married to David Justice between 1993 and 1997, and singer Eric Benét from 2001 to 2005.

In February, a source told Us Weekly that the star 'absolutely believes Van is the one for her' and that she 'can see herself settling down with him.'

The insider said that Hunt 'really brings out the fun side of' the A-list beauty, adding that he's 'creative and funny and constantly challenging Halle and making her laugh.'

The source noted, 'Van is head over heels for Halle. It's adorable to see how much his is infatuated with her.'

Halle will next be seen in the Netflix martial arts movie Bruised. The film, which stars Berry as disgraced MMA fighter Jackie Justice, is also the actress's directorial debut.

However a source has now claimed that the duo have split after trying to make things work long distance 'put a strain' on their relationship.

Claims: Phoebe Dynevor and Pete Davidson have reportedly called it quits on their romance after five months of dating (pictured at Wimbledon in the UK in July)

A source told The Sun: 'Pete and Phoebe's romance was a real whirlwind and from the start they were both totally committed.

'It was pretty telling when Phoebe headed to Croatia with her mates this week rather than going to see Pete in America.

'It was wild while it lasted... But the distance has put a strain on them. They will remain close but unless something drastic changes their relationship won't recover.'

The source continued that both of the stars have very busy schedules at the moment, with Phoebe filming Bridgerton series two in the UK and Pete working on Saturday Night Live in the US as well as filming a movie called Meet Cute.

It is also thought that travel restrictions have added a further pressure to their romance as it isn't easy to just 'jump on a plane' and see each other.

MailOnline has contacted Phoebe and Pete's representatives for further comment.

The Saturday Night Live star is said to have told pals he thought the actress was 'hot as hell' over her character Daphne's intimate scenes with Simon, The Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page).

A Los Angeles based friend of Pete's told The Mirror: 'Pete just loved Bridgerton and just got totally tripped out by Phoebe.

'She was totally his type - fresh faced, youthful, innocent looking beauty.

'We all joked with him about the naughty scenes, and of course he confessed he found them hot. He binge watched the show and felt it was his destiny to meet her.'

The stars - who are both based in the UK - will not have to quarantine when they come home as Croatia is currently on the green travel list.

Filming on the second series of Bridgerton was recently delayed yet again after a Covid outbreak on set.

And Naomi Watts showed exactly where she gets them from on Sunday.

The actress posted several pictures of her gorgeous grandmother as she turned 96.

The apple doesn't far fall from the tree! Naomi Watts showed just where she gets her stunning good looks from as she posted pictures of her gorgeous grandmother on her 96th birthday over the weekend

Just like Naomi, her nan has sparkling blue eyes and a beautiful smile.

The 21 Grams star revealed in the caption of her picture that she hadn't seen her grandmother in almost two years.

'Happy birthday, Nanna!! 96 today!! These pics were taken in December 2019 (the last time i saw her!!). She’s the OG matriarch in our family,' she wrote.

'Tells a great story to this day. Loves to cook and boss everyone about. I attribute my hard work ethic to her. "Get off ya dinger" is a regular saying.

'I miss her so much. Can’t wait to see you when the world opens up! xox PS. I just heard they’ve suddenly gone into lockdown, so Nana is solo today!' she added.

'Please wish her the happiest birthday. ❤️'

Naomi is clearly missing her family.

Last week, she revealed one of her very favourite fashion pieces was a stunning vintage Ozzie Clarke dress, handed down from her beloved mother Myfanwy.

A classic beauty! Last week, Naomi revealed one of her very favourite fashion pieces was a stunning vintage Ozzie Clarke dress that was handed down from her beloved mother Myfanwy.

The floor-length floral dress had long sleeves and a large cut-out in the middle which showed off the 21 Grams star's décolletage and flat stomach.

The mother-of-two explained she has been wearing the vintage piece for 'decades'.

'I can’t remember if it was gifted or grifted. But this is my mum's #ozzieclark dress from 1975, and I’ve worn it for decades,' she wrote.

'A true classic. My hoarding gene is paying off! Nanna taught me right.'

Naomi was raised by her mother Myfanwy after her father Peter Watts died from an overdose in 1976.

The Mulholland Drive star was just seven-years-old when her father lost his life at the age of 31.

Back in an interview with The Guardian in 2017, Naomi said that rock band Pink Floyd stepped in to support her family after her father Peter Watts died from an overdose in 1976.

Peter was a sound engineer for the Wish You Were Here hitmakers, who helped the Watts family in the immediate aftermath of his death.

Hero: Naomi was raised by her mother Myfanwy after her father Peter Watts died from an overdose in 1976. They are pictured her together in 2011

She said: 'When he died, my dad hadn’t saved money, and I guess my mum didn’t have any. 'So they, the band, very kindly… ‘Trust fund’ doesn’t sound right at all. I think they gave my mum a few thousand dollars to help get things under way. A lump sum, to help. It was kind that they did that.'

The actress said she burst into tears when a Pink Floyd fan gave her a photo of her father in which she could clearly see his smile for the first time in her life.

She spoke of the importance of the moment: 'You’ve got to understand, I’ve got maybe three photos of my dad, and maybe two memories, and all of the photos of him are either out of focus or he’s a tiny speck in the background.'

The actress' parents Myfanwy Roberts and Peter Watts had divorced when she was four.

Close: Naomi is incredibly close with her mother (centre) who often accompanies the actress to events

Reflecting on her parents quirky styles, she said: 'I’d had enough of cool. I didn’t want cool. I wanted my parents to wear three-piece suits and tweed, not leather pants and four-inch platform boots.'

The Kent-born star credits moving around a lot as a child after her father's death- she went to nine different schools in England before emigrating to Australia at 14 - with learning how to reinvent herself.

The family moved to the North Shore area of Sydney where Naomi settled and eventually made friends with a teenage Nicole Kidman.

The aspiring actresses were cast together in Australian comedy, 1991's Flirting.

After a few episodes of Home & Away she was cast in the Hollywood movie Tank Girl and moved to the States.

Naomi, who labelled herself 'unhireable' spend many years being rejected at every audition before she got her big break in 2001's Mulholland Drive.

She was in a long-term relationship with Spotlight actor Liev Schreiber. After 11 years, the couple went their separate ways last year, but maintain a close relationship for their sons Sasha and Samuel.

Presents! The Made In Chelsea star was in for a treat as his girlfriend Zara gifted him a brand new Vespa Scooter, while she was also presented with cupcakes

Sam shared a plethora of snaps of his big day to his Instagram, with images including ones of his family as they helped mark his big day.

Captioning his post, he penned: 'It’s my birthday today, spending it with the nearest and dearest. I won’t get overly emotional, but I am under no illusions as to how unbelievably lucky I am to have my family, who put up with me and keep me in check. I love you guys so much and you’re my rock.'

He added: 'Here’s to many more years of acting like a child......LET THE BOTOX BEGIN!! (ps yes those are @p_wicks01 cupcakes) swipe to see what my amazing girlfriend got me!!!'

The collection of images also saw Sam and Zara sitting on the black scooter she brought for his birthday, with large blue '29' balloons seen hanging on the back.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nearly 60 per cent of Britons have tried to find out how much people they know spent on their latest property purchase, new figures have revealed.

While few believe it is acceptable to ask someone what they paid for a home outright, the vast majority have adopted under-the-radar tactics to discover what family, friends, 'frenemies', neighbours, colleagues and even potential partners paid for their homes.

Twenty-four per cent of people admitted they had even called time on a relationship after finding out the value of their partner's home, according to Zoopla.

Clued up: Nearly 60 per cent of Britons have tried to find out how much people they know spent on their latest property purchase, according to Zoopla

People also use 'super-snooping' tactics, which include searching for sale records online, to see how much a home they want to buy was last sold for, or to track what has happened to the price tag of a property they used to live in.

'People always want to know what others have paid for a property', Camilla Dell, managing partner at Black Brick Property Solutions, told This is Money.

While the majority of people are activity snooping, 65 per cent said they would never admit to the owner that they had researched their property's sold price.

Neighbours, friends and family member's homes are the most likely targets for super-snoopers, but 11 per cent said they had also looked up what a colleague paid for a property.

Three in ten said they were able to make assumptions about their colleagues' pay packets after finding out how much they were able to fork out for their home.

How to track house prices HM Land Registry has an online tool which enables people to look up sold prices for properties across England and Wales. Separate tools apply for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Land Registry sold data is used by websites including Rightmove, Zoopla and others to show how much properties went for. At the height of the pandemic last year, there was a lull in publishing up-to-date sold price data for house prices, with the Land Registry claiming it was focused on providing its 'core' services instead. But sold price data is now readily available, and generally seems up-to-date again. There are a few other options for keeping abreast of house prices near where you live. Halifax and Nationwide both publish their own indices each month. Both of these data sets are based on significantly fewer transactions than the Office for National Statistics' – around 15,000 a month – and as they are based on their own mortgage lending they exclude cash purchases, making them less comprehensive. They are, however, more up-to-date than the Land Registry, where a sale can take weeks or months to be registered in the system. Every three months, Nationwide also puts out more detailed regional house price reports. There's also LSL Acadata, which is based on Land Registry data, but uses its own internal models to give more up to date predictions and forecasts.

One in ten people said they had even checked out the value of the home of a prospective, current or former partner.

Nearly a third said they continued to date someone they would have otherwise ditched after viewing the price tag of their home online. For people aged between 35 to 44, this figure rose to 46 per cent.

Around half of people said seeing a partner's property value 'encouraged' them to keep dating someone, rising to 63 per cent for men.

But a quarter of people said they had called time on a relationship after viewing the value of their partner's home.

The emotions stirred by seeing how much someone has paid for a home can be complicated, and 11 per cent admitted they felt jealous after seeing the figures involved.

However, 10 per cent said they respected the person more after seeing their property's value, while 9 per cent said they felt they liked the person more than before.

Tom Parker, consumer spokesperson for Zoopla. said: 'Buttoned up Brits love talking about house prices - but for most, asking someone straight up what they paid for their home is still considered a taboo.

'But how much a house sold for is publicly available information and is easy to source online.

'Whether it's your boss, a friend or even a potential partner, it's clear we want to know more about the homes they live in and will often treat them differently as a result.'

Buying agents will often go to great lengths to help their clients find out what other people paid for a home they are interested in.

Camilla Dell added: 'As buying agents, before we submit an offer on a property we always do a comprehensive "buying report" for our clients.

'Within the report we highlight relevant comparable sales. It’s all about the price per square foot - the price paid divided by the internal square footage.

'This gives our clients a pretty good idea if the price they are paying is reasonable or not, and also aids us with our negotiations.

'We obtain data via Lonres - an industry-only database for agents, and the Land Registry.

'For off-plan sales, obtaining comparable sales data is a lot more difficult as sales will only appear on the Land Registry once they have completed which could be years away.'

Last month, data from the Office for National Statics revealed that average house prices across the country increased by 10 per cent in the year to May.

Some buyers fear they paid too much for their latest property, after savings from the stamp duty holiday were eaten up by soaring price tags.

The main stamp duty holiday applicable on homes up to £500,000 ended on 30 June.

Until 30 September the nil rate band will be £250,000. It will then return to the standard amount of £125,000 on 1 October.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ever heard of the phrase 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush'?

At its most basic level, this is the 'endowment effect' and is based on the finding that people will often place greater value on things once they have established ownership – be that a tangible object, such as a painting, or something less tangible like a stock market investment.

It leads to a situation where people will demand more money to sell an item that they own than they, or other people, would be prepared to pay for it, writes Rob Smith, head of behavioural finance at Barclays Wealth.

Emotional biases may have an impact on your investments, particularly if you're holding onto loss-making assets in the hope they'll 'come good'

Experts believe it's down to human nature and our deep-rooted aversion to feeling a sense of loss.

For example, we feel loss when we give up something we own, but we do not have that same feeling when we choose not to purchase something.

We are keener to avoid losing the item than we are to acquire it, and so put a higher value on it.

To bring this to life, the most well-known study on the behaviour found that participants wanted $7.12 to sell a mug that they owned, which had no sentimental value, but would only pay $2.87 to buy the same mug when they didn't own it.

Closely related to the endowment effect is the 'disposition effect', where investors hold onto loss-making assets longer than those that make gains – in the hope that they will 'come good' eventually.

These emotional biases towards things we already own can have a real impact on investors, as it can lead them to value their existing investments higher than what they would be willing to pay if they did not already own them.

Signs you're a sufferer

Feeling an emotional connection to your investments, whether this is to the company itself or its past financial performance, will increase your chances of suffering from the endowment effect.

This doesn't always mean that feeling a connection to your investments is a bad thing, but it does mean you need to be conscious of how your feelings might be influencing your judgement.

For instance, if you don't actively compare your investments with other potential opportunities, you might be falling prey to these effects and be missing out financially.

A sure fire way to tell is to pretend you don't currently hold your investments, and ask yourself 'would I buy this at its current price if I didn't already own it'?

If the answer is no, then you are certainly suffering from these effects and should consider selling.

Practical ways to fight it

Rob Smith: Consider whether you'd buy an asset at its current price if you didn't already own it

There are a couple of ways that you can try to overcome your emotional biases and work out if you're attaching too much value to your investments – potentially losing out on good market opportunities:

1. Think about an investment very similar to the one you own, but that's not in your portfolio.

Try to establish what you would view as a reasonable price for the investment were you to buy it today.

If the value is less than that of your current investment, then you should think about selling.

2. Consider the opportunity cost, as in the money you could be losing out on, by holding your investment – if there are other options that provide better risk-adjusted returns, then you should be looking to sell.

A gain of 5 per cent in isolation may seem attractive, but if this is considered against an 8 per cent gain from another investment with similar risk, then it becomes easier to overcome the bias.

3. Take a look at your portfolio and work out whether you hold any emotional attachments to your investments, and why.

It could be that you've inherited them from a close family member, that you used to work for the company in your youth, or that they're a sustainable investment addressing issues that you care about.

Whilst these are all sound reasons, and very understandable, the reality is that any emotional attachment to your investments can harm your decision making ability – so try and limit your emotions where you can.

When it comes to investing, it's fine to be led by motivations other than just financial returns, particularly when it comes to ESG investing - but even these investments should be judged as dispassionately as possible and on their merits.

By understanding your emotions, you can try to manage them - giving yourself the best chance of creating a portfolio that is fully diversified and set-up to take advantage of market opportunities, whilst weathering any market storms.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The stamp duty holiday and house price rises have led to a spike in the number of mortgages lent to those more at risk of defaulting.

The number of single-income households borrowing four or more times their salary hit a five-year high at the beginning of this year according to new figures, as buyers grappled with rising house prices.

In the first three months of 2021, 12.6 per cent of new mortgages were lent to people in that higher-risk category, according to auditors Mazars.

Risky business: Banks are lending a larger proportion of mortgages to those borrowers who are in theory more likely to default on their loans, according to new figures

This was the highest proportion since 2016, and a jump of more than one percentage point since before the pandemic in the first three months of 2019 when 11.4 per cent of single-income customers borrowed more than 4 times their wage.

Mazars blamed the increase on the stamp duty holiday and low mortgage interest rates, which it said had 'tempted more buyers to stretch their finances'.

Interest rates are at historic lows, with Halifax having launched a two-year fixed rate at 0.83 per cent.

Buyers at all levels of the market have been forced to pay more for their homes since the start of the pandemic.

This was thanks to a surge in demand for moving house as people's lifestyle needs changed, as well as the stamp duty holiday which offered people a maximum tax saving of £15,000 before it was tapered down to £5,000 at the end of June.

The latest estimates suggest that house prices jumped by 10.5 per cent in the year to July, increasing by around £25,000.

Most mainstream lenders will only allow mortgage holders to borrow 4 or 4.5 times their salary, though those with significant equity built up in their homes often borrow far less.

Highly mortgaged: The proportion of individual home buyers borrowing more than 4 times what they earn in a year has increased to 12.6 per cent according to Mazars

However there are exceptions to that rule. For example, Nationwide changed its policy earlier this year to allow first-time buyers to borrow up to 5.5 times their salary - 20 per cent more than its standard limit.

To do so, though, they would need to lock in to their mortgage deal for at least five years.

Those who own less of their homes proportionally are also at higher risk of negative equity if house prices were to fall.

Paul Rouse, partner at Mazars, said lending at higher salary multiples could cause problems for both customers and lenders down the line, especially as Government wage support schemes such as furlough came to an end.

He also said it would likely lead to higher levels of personal debt, especially for first-time buyers who usually borrow the most relative to their salaries because they do not have equity from an existing home to draw on for their deposit.

'Some borrowers, notably first-time buyers with small deposits, may have over-extended themselves,' Rouse said.

'If the exit from the lockdown is bumpier than expected, this could lead to significant job losses.

'It would be miraculous if such a huge blow to the economy can be absorbed without higher levels of personal insolvency.'

Since the pandemic mortgage lenders have been under growing pressure from the regulator to offer more support to borrowers who find themselves unable to meet their payments.

While this could be good news for customers, it could land lenders in hot water.

'Lenders are finding themselves in an uncomfortable position, as they face pressure from regulators to offer forbearance to struggling borrowers,' Rouse said.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The cost of a detached house has surged by around £46,000 since the pandemic began as buyers searched for more space, according to Rightmove.

The price tag for such a home has soared by 10 per cent, hitting over £500,000 on average nationally. Back in February last year, the average cost of a detached house was £471,406.

In contrast, the average asking price of a flat has risen by just 1 per cent, or around £2,000, in the same period and is now worth £277,302.

How much? The cost of a detached house has surged by around £46,000 in the past year

There are signs that flats are starting to make a comeback, however, with the number of sales agreed up by 14 per cent in June and July compared to the same point last year.

This has the potential to push the price of flats up in the coming months, driven by lockdown restrictions easing, medium to long term working patterns becoming clearer and better availability of low-deposit mortgages, Rightmove said.

The cheapest location to get on the property ladder is the North East of England, with average asking prices for flats at £103,098, while the most expensive area outside London is the South East, where average asking prices for flats are £235,073.

The average asking price for a flat in London is £534,054, marking a drop of 2 per cent since February 2020.

Tim Bannister, Rightmove’s director of property data, said: 'Navigating a busy market can be daunting for buyers, especially if they’re looking to get onto the property ladder for the first time.

'However the latest data might suggest an opportunity for some first-time buyers, with average asking prices for flats currently up by 1 per cent, which is significantly less than the price increases we’ve seen for other property types.

He added: 'The sharp rise in average asking prices for detached homes probably comes as no surprise to those who have been following the rush for room that emerged when the market reopened, and with available stock still limited and strong demand continuing, we’re unlikely to see prices fall for this property type anytime soon.'

Property listings continue to fall

The number of properties being listed for sale continued to drop last month, pushing house price inflation up further, according to a separate closely-watched survey published today.

The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said new instructions from sellers 'moved deeper into negative territory' last month, and are at their worst level since April 2020.

With the primary phase of the stamp duty holiday gone, newly agreed property sales and queries from prospective buyers also fell last month, the Rics said.

But house prices continued to rise everywhere in the country, with the North of England, Wales and East Anglia seeing particularly strong growth. On the flip side, house price growth in London was markedly weaker.

Experts at the Rics said some buyers were struggling to move up the property ladder amid high demand for houses with more space over smaller flats.

Dwindling: The number of properties being listed for sale has continued to drop

Waning: Queries from prospective buyers fell last month, according to the Rics

The Rics said tight supply was a 'crucial factor' in sustaining higher house prices across the country 'for the time being.'

A total of 66 per cent of estate agents surveyed said they thought property prices would continue to rise over the next year, up from 56 per cent in June.

But new buyer enquiries shrank in July, ending a positive four-month streak for the housing market.

The Rics added: 'As a result, the number agreed sales also reportedly took a dip, posting a net balance of -21 per cent in July across the UK, with sales volumes slowing most notably in Yorkshire & the Humber, the East Midlands and East Anglia.'

Ian Macklin of estate agency group Ian Macklin & Company in Hale, Greater Manchester, said: 'The ending of the stamp duty holiday has resulted in fewer new instructions and sales which are broadly back to the levels previously experienced.'

Summing up the survey's findings, Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Rics, said: ''Although the tapering in stamp duty is beginning to have some impact on RICS activity indicators, the overall tone to the market remains firm with the metrics capturing price expectations showing few signs of wavering.

'Significantly, a strong message from survey respondents is that buyers are continuing to place a premium on space with the prospect of a hybrid model of work being adopted by many organisations providing the opportunity for greater flexibility around location.

'This is being reflected both in the challenge some current homeowners are having in moving up the property ladder, as well in stronger price expectations from the Rics survey for larger than smaller properties.'

On the up: Stock shortages are pushing property prices up
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2018, Laura Crawford took a huge gamble. She swapped long hours as a management consultant in the City to start a nappy brand.

Fed-up with toddler tantrums and a colicky baby, she launched Mama Bamboo as an alternative to damaging plastic nappies and a lack of eco alternatives.

Here, as part of our new B Corp Beat series - focusing the spotlight on 'green' British companies - we find out more…

Mama Bamboo uses FSC-certified Moso bamboo which is fully sustainable and naturally antibacterial

The Attenborough effect

Laura admits she gave little thought to the effects disposable nappies had on the environment when she had her first child.

'I had no idea what was in a nappy, I hadn't even considered it and just bought what was on the shelf. I accepted that nappy rash was part and parcel and there was no alternative.'

Like the plastic straws and single use plastic bags David Attenborough warned about in his 2017 documentary Blue Planet II, approximately 8million disposable nappies are thrown into landfill every single day in the UK and can take up to 500 years to biodegrade.

By the time Laura's son was due she had cottoned on to the effects of single use plastic and sought out alternatives like reusable cloth nappies.

'As soon as he was born he went into cloth nappies which were a nightmare. I was handling a new born that was too small for the nappies, he was colicky, and my daughter was only 2 years old,' she says.

'It was the last straw. I went to find eco disposables and, at the time, there was only one brand and I didn't get on with them - they were papery, stiff and leaked a lot.'

What is a B Corp? In our new B Corp Beat series, we are interviewing British businesses which meet these strict standards. They are described as businesses that are said to meet the 'highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.' One the website, it says: 'B Corp Certification doesn't just evaluate a product or service; it assesses the overall positive impact of the company that stands behind it. And increasingly that's what people care most about.' B Corp was started in 2006 and gives scores to companies in order for them to be verified. These five areas are: governance, workers, community, environment and customers.

Shortly afterwards, the idea for Mama Bamboo was born.

'It was during a conversation with a friend who was an expat living over in Singapore - she mentioned that in Asia they had been using bamboo to make nappies for quite a long time.

'I was surprised because I couldn't work out how bamboo used in flooring and for plates could possibly be used in a nappy.'

Bamboo has become a popular alternative because it grows quickly and, in the correct conditions, does not need any chemicals, fertiliser, pesticides or irrigation system.

Laura opted for FSC-certified Moso bamboo which is fully sustainable and naturally antibacterial.

In the spring season it can grow between 12 and 15 feet in just three weeks so it is not in short supply.

The bamboo is shipped from China meaning it is still contributing negatively to the environment and not a completely sustainable option.

Mama Bamboo is not the only one creating bamboo nappies: eco brand Cheeky Panda has developed its own range while Boots now produces nappies which use 40 per cent plant-based materials.

By comparison Mama Bamboo claims its nappies currently biodegrade more than 60 per cent in less than three months and can achieve 80 per cent within two years. At this time no nappy can offer 100 per cent.

Laura says that each year, it calculates its carbon footprint and replants enough bamboo to soak up the equivalent carbon within two years.

While Mama Bamboo's eco credentials may come out on top, the challenge for Laura is convincing customers her products are best. Her immediate plan is to raise investment to expand both the product range and Mama Bamboo's geographical reach.

Crowdfunding round

Mama Bamboo has slowly built itself up over three years, and because it is mainly an online subscription business, it has not been too hurt by the pandemic.

Customers can save up to 20 per cent by subscribing but the products are still considerably more expensive than plastic disposables. A carton of 35 nappies costs £7.40 while an 80 pack of Pampers costs just £10.

This clear disparity between the two may prove to be a barrier to mainstream uptake.

However, Laura says the company has grown from a turnover of £360,000 last year to being on target for £900,000 this year. As the business grows more, so too does the need for specific expertise at the helm.

Laura Crawford launched Mama Bamboo in 2018 after she could not find any disposable eco-friendly nappies

'Jennie, who runs the logistics and operations, is my university friend. I brought her in the early days to help me pack boxes and now she's worked her way up to the head of logistics,' Laura says.

'We've got to the point where we can see the gaps within the team and I can feel where my amateur working of marketing and sales is holding the business back now.'

As a result, Mama Bamboo has launched a crowdfunding round with ecobank Triodos, targeting £540,000 worth of investment.

The decision to opt for crowdfunding came after Laura was approached by the head of Triodos' crowdfunding who incidentally used Mama Bamboo's products.

'We're still a start-up. I would personally find it quite hard to ask a single angel investor for half a million pounds. Whereas I felt more comfortable spreading it out amongst a couple of hundred investors, managing the risk a little better.'

Laura's main priority is hiring a sales director to ramp up Mama Bamboo's international presence.

The company was forced to abandon selling in the EU through Amazon amid the Brexit uncertainty.

'We're at the stage where we're ready to get back in there. Instead of shipping products to Amazon FBA UK, who handled logistics, I'm looking to have EU distributors that we can ship directly to from China with tailored branding.'

Laura is nothing but ambitious. She also wants to expand the product line into homeware, which would include bathrobes and towels, as well as a range of baby care products and a feminine care range.

B Corp certification

Mama Bamboo has carved out its niche. It says it was the first UK company to sell nappies made from sustainably grown bamboo and the only firm in the world whose nappies include fully compostable linings and packaging.

Its eco credentials don't just stop with its products.

Mama Bamboo launched the #nappyrevolution campaign calling on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to change the way councils handle nappy and wipe waste.

And in 2021/22 Mama Bamboo will partner with UCL to develop a sustainable circular economy model for councils to adopt curbside collection of industrial compost waste, including nappies and wipes.

This work prompted one of Laura's team to encourage Mama Bamboo to apply for a B Corp certification.

Prospective companies have to go through rigorous assessments and is awarded to organisation who achieve as core of at least 80 out of 200 against five areas of impact: Governance, Community, Workers, Environment and Customers.

It led to Mama Bamboo going through the painstaking process of switching banks after the organisation noted there were better and more ethical alternatives.

'We changed bank to Starling. I hadn't thought about the fact we were banking with someone who didn't particularly have an ethical background.'

Over the 11 months it took for Mama Bamboo to be certified as a B Corp, Laura learned more about the audits required, particularly for Chinese suppliers.

'We were doing it through an independent third party and [the certifiers] pushed us towards some standard international audits that not only will get a standard score but the companies themselves will be more incentivised to try and improve their score because they can use it in their own marketing.'

Mama Bamboo achieved certification in 2020, making it the only UK and European Nappy Company to join the ethical group of businesses.

She says: 'I love the ethos. it's not just about the product, it's about the business and the practices. And they fact you have to use your business for good not just for profit.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@One of the stand-out features of the pandemic has been the reliance many Britons have had on streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime, Disney, Netflix and Now TV, to help cure the indoor boredom.

When it comes to choosing what to watch next, many of the streaming giants have a section with recommendations - and more often than not, they feel fairly out of sync.

Greg Vartoukian had enough of this and the pandemic prompted the self-confessed film buff to start work on an idea he'd had for a number of years: a personalised film and TV recommendation website.

Watch Clever's 'taste fingerprint' - essentially a blueprint of your personal taste - which also screens for quality, narrows down the very best recommendations.

Netflix and Chill: streaming platforms tend to push their own original productions over genuine recommendations

Streaming services don't prioritise recommendations

Despite a career largely spent in corporate circles - including a stint as financial director of the London Business School - Greg is no stranger to the glamour of the film industry.

A decade ago he invested in a small film with Hollywood star Idris Elba, and was even cast as an extra, all the while sitting on a very early idea for what would become Watch Clever.

'For some years I felt there wasn't a way to find stuff that truly suited my individual taste. There's movies which can be critically acclaimed or rated highly but that doesn't always necessarily mean that I'm going to particularly enjoy it,' Greg says.

Greg's own film taste is far from high brow - his top three films are Back to the Future, Gladiator and Enemy of the State.

'That was part of it - I have quite an accessible taste, a lot of the film critics however do not necessarily have that taste and that was part of the challenge.'

When he first thought about a more personalised way of recommending films, he thought the streaming giants would beat him to it.

Streaming platforms have been a real pandemic winner - the number of subscribers in the UK increased by more than 8million in 2020.

Greg Vartoukian started work on Watch Clever during the pandemic

They have now monopolised TV consumption, with the number of subscribers now double the number signed up to traditional pay TV providers like Sky and BT.

But this dominance means they have little incentive to finetune their own algorithm, instead pumping out their own original content in favour of their users' tastes, according to Greg.

As the country braced itself for a national lockdown Greg started to think seriously about how to develop Watch Clever: 'I had a broad vision of what I wanted to develop, I certainly didn't have it all mapped out but I thought let's give it a go.'

By the start of summer 2020 the wheels were in motion.

Developing a taste fingerprint

Greg and his small team of developers created a model where each film or TV show is auto-labelled by a set of characteristics, including pace, intricacy and emotional punch.

These same characteristics are used to develop a user's taste fingerprint, which is initially configured when they pick their top three films during the sign up process.

Users can then apply a taste filter to all searches so only films which score a one - a perfect taste match - or 2 will appear in the search.

'Movies and TV shows are typically classified by genre but I thought that was insufficient.

'There are DNA characteristics in a movie - if it's fast, emotional, intricate or surreal… I love comedies but I don't like surreal comedy so it's being able to go beyond just the comedy genre without having to do a load of research.'

Watch Clever asks users in-depth questions about their film and TV taste to develop a taste fingerprint

Watch Clever also screens for quality using Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb data - as well as a mood filter, which incorporates shortcuts like feel-good or intriguing to help users decide what to watch.

So far it has proved popular. It piloted the website at the end of 2020 before launching in 2021.

It has since attracted 50,000 users from almost 80 countries, an impressive feat given it has largely neglected traditional marketing in favour of Search Engine Optimisation and Search Engine Marketing.

'Because of the universal appeal, when people search on a search engine they ask "I need a good movie to watch tonight" or "what are the newest TV shows", "what can I watch on Netflix" and being directed to us.'

The next challenge for Greg is building his premium membership, of which there are just a few hundred users.

For £19.99 a year, users can filter search by streaming providers, filter all search options by mood, year or rating, and access curated lists.

Soon it will start to offer a personalised newsletter, and is even looking at developing a joint taste fingerprint to take the stress out of Netflix and Chill.

A logical step forward would be to make an approach to partner with some of the major streaming platforms, a move Greg has not ruled out.

'We really want to get up and running and establish ourselves before connecting with some of those. It's definitely something for the future- there's various different ways in which we could potentially connect, one being the algorithm… we're not quite there yet.'

Watch Clever is still in its early stages but it has managed to tap into something most people who use streaming sites find increasingly frustrating.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Homeowners in the UK will be offered £7,000 grants to help replace their gas boilers in a new £400million scrappage scheme.

Plans have been pulled together to improve the Clean Heat Grants scheme for relaunch in April next year.

Earlier reports about the future of the scheme suggested ministers were examining the idea of a £4,000 'clean heat grant' that would help pay for new green boilers from next April for two years.

However, The Times reports that the plans have had another overhaul with hopes of quadrupling the budget, with grants starting from £7,000 and extending the scheme to three years.

The Clean Heat Grants scheme is set to be relaunched in April next year and will see the government quadruple its budget, including grants starting from £7,000 to replace gas boilers. Pictured: Boris Johnson visits a wind farm in Aberdeenshire last week

Homeowners in the UK will be offered £7,000 grants to help replace their gas boilers. Picture: Stock image

The scheme will help pay for close to 60,000 heat pumps to be installed and will see a large-scale advertising push to replace gas boilers.

The government has set a target to install 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 - which cost £10,000 compared to £1,000 for a new gas boiler.

Heat pumps transfer a source of heat or warmth, such as the heat from soil in the garden, from one destination to another, such as a hot-water system in a home.

Compared to boilers, heat pumps use a small amount of electricity - often achieving a 200%-600% efficiency rate because the amount of heat produced is higher than the energy consumed.

The scheme is just one of several plans Boris Johnson has announced in recent weeks, including plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and hopes to scrap all gas boilers within four years.

He has committed to achieving ‘net zero’ carbon emissions by 2050 – a target that could cost £1.4trillion.

Families will shoulder much of this expense – up to £400 a year per household – through having to replace their gas boilers and switch to electric cars, among other things.

It comes after a new UN climate report painted a bleak picture of the future without immediate action.

If hydrogen is part of a zero-carbon future, it could have to be produced by electrolysis (as shown above), which sees electric currents passed through water. Another option is for the plants to capture the carbon emissions and pump them underground

A major UN climate report put huge pressure on Governments to take more action to cut emissions in the run up to international Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow in November.

Boris Johnson is reportedly hoping to announce the scheme ahead of the climate change conference.

The pledge has caused fury in Tory circles, with MPs warning that the additional costs will hit lower earners in the Conservative-voting Red Wall. It has also reportedly led to clashes between the Prime Minister and his Chancellor Rishi Sunak.

Kent MP Craig Mackinlay has launched a group to to push back at plans he argues could be could 'completely kill us off politically'.

He and others argue they will hit poorer voters in former 'Red Wall' areas who voted Conservative for the first time in 2019.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said last night ministers 'want to try and help people make that transition' when asked about the expense to consumers of scrapping gas boilers.

The UN's climate report, which has sparked much of the new climate change tackling schemes, focuses on the physical science of climate change, forms the first part of the IPCC's sixth assessment report, and is even clearer on the impact humans are having on the planet than the last such analysis in 2013.

It draws on more than 14,000 scientific papers to reach its conclusions and has found it is 'unequivocal' that human activity is warming the world.

Rapid and widespread changes to the land, atmosphere and oceans have occurred - from temperature increases to sea level rises - that are unprecedented for many centuries or even many thousands of years.

A new group is being set up by Kent MP Craig Mackinlay to push back at plans to outlaw sales of new petrol and diesel cars and replace gas boilers within the next 20 years. Chancellor Rishi Sunak (left) is said to be looking at ways to ease the pressure on poorer families of the transition.

The report makes clear that human-caused climate change, which has pushed up global temperatures by 1.1C, is driving weather and climate extremes in every region across the world.

There are already more frequent and intense heatwaves and heavy rainstorms in many places, including northern Europe, as well as droughts and cyclones.

How much will new green and anti-obesity projects cost Britons? Boris Johnson's green and anti-obesity projects could end up costing Britain's households more than £28,000 each over the coming decade if they are fully implemented, it emerged today.

Humans are also very likely the main driver in the global retreat of glaciers, declines in Arctic sea ice, and rising sea levels.

Sea level rises are speeding up, with the oceans rising by 3.7mm (0.15 inches) a year in recent years, and are set to continue to rise this century whether emissions remain high or fall dramatically.

Changes to oceans, sea levels and melting permafrost and glaciers are irreversible for decades, centuries or even millennia as a result of past and future warming.

And cities are at particular risk as the climate warms, experiencing hotter temperatures in heatwaves and flash flooding from heavy rain.

The study also warns that unlikely events such ice sheet collapses, abrupt changes to ocean circulation - which drives weather patterns - and much higher warming cannot be ruled out.

But the report, which assesses the potential impact of a range of five future scenarios from very low emissions to very high pollution, highlights the impacts of the choices the world makes now.

Temperature rises have a good chance of remaining below 1.5C in the long term if carbon emissions are cut to net zero by 2050, followed by efforts to take more carbon dioxide out of the air than is put into the atmosphere, along with deep cuts to other greenhouse gases.

Cutting methane - produced by oil and gas drilling and agriculture, particularly livestock farming - could help curb rising temperatures, as well as improving air quality, the report said.

But scientists who worked on the report said current pledges of action on emissions put the world on a pathway that could lead to 2.7C of warming by the late 21st century - or higher if the pledges were not delivered on.

Sea levels would rise by around 28-55cm (11-22 inches) by 2100 in a very low emissions scenario, but by significantly more if emissions stayed high.

Every additional 0.5C temperature rise leads to clear increases in the intensity of heatwaves, rainstorms and flooding, and droughts in some regions.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and former Microsoft head honcho Bill Gates may not be the most popular people in some quarters but the mere mention of their names was enough to propel the shares of Bluejay Mining higher this week.

The AIM-listed development company focused on Greenland and Finland saw its shares surge 57 per cent this week after an announcement entitled 'JV with Bill Gates & Jeff Bezos backed Company'.

Full marks to the person who came up with the idea of putting those names in the stock market announcement's headline.

Bluejay Mining shares rose this week after the AIM-listed company published an announcement entitled 'JV with Bill Gates & Jeff Bezos backed Company'

The joint venture is with KoBold Metals, a company whose principal investors include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate & technology fund 'overseen' by Bill Gates and backed by luminaries such as Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, Ray Dalio, the hedge fund billionaire, and the aforementioned Jeff Bezos, the sometime astronaut (in space, nobody can ask you to pay taxes).

KoBold Metals is a mineral exploration company that uses machine learning to guide exploration for new deposits rich in the critical materials for electric vehicles.

It has got into bed with Bluejay on the latter's Disko-Nuussuaq nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum magmatic massive sulphide project in Central West Greenland.

Sadly it is only a joint venture and not a merger so we can't do the 'Merger at the Disko' headline, which is a shame as the name of KoBold's chief executive, Kurt House, also offers up ample opportunity for dance music puns.

Under the terms of the agreement, KoBold can earn 51 per cent of Disko through a two-stage earn-in, Bluejay can maintain a 49 per cent interest through proportionate funding of the project and will manage field operations during this period.

In other 'not a merger' news, Powerhouse Energy Group has acquired 48 per cent of Engsolve, an engineering consultancy, for £99,990 in cash.

The waste-to-energy firm's chief technology officer, Paul Emmitt, is also the managing director and founder of Engsolve and by taking this stake the company should ensure Engsolve's continued support of the company's projects and developments.

Powerhouse's shares advanced 46 per cent to 4.6p.

Something that is not yet a merger but could well be is the strained courtship of TP Group by Science Group.

Science Group has been doing the equivalent of singing love songs beneath the balcony of TP Group, the provider of mission-critical software.

The board of TP Group, however, had been cocking a deaf 'un to Science Group's entreaties so Science Group acquired a 10.2 per cent stake in TP Group at 5p a share in the hope it would force TP's top brass to the table to discuss a potential combination of the two companies.

Since then, things have gone a bit quiet although wheels may be in motion behind the scenes; in the meantime, TP shareholders are advised to take no action with their shares, which currently trade at 5.3p, up 36 per cent on the week.

A trading update from Pipehawk sent the underground radar and mapping group's 39 per cent higher to 9p, with the company flagging up a sharp improvement in revenues in the second half of its financial year.

Turnover was roughly £4.1million in the first half of 2021, compared to £2.6million in the second half of 2020.

The sales pipeline (no pun intended) is so strong the group is looking to move to bigger premises.

Quadrise Fuels International motored 29 per cent higher to 3.79 after it said testing of its new low carbon alternative to heavy fuel bioMSAR oil has revealed a greater-than-expected reduction in CO2 emissions.

Minds + Machines Group (MMX) has completed a sale of its top-level domains (TLDs) and related assets to an affiliate of US domain registry giant GoDaddy, following the signing of a purchase agreement in early April.

MMX added that the proceeds of the sale implied a net asset value for the group of 9.6p per share and that it has approved a return of capital to shareholders through a tender offer of $80million to be completed in early autumn.

Shares in MMX currently trade at 8.55p, up 17 per cent this week.

Best of the Best, the online organiser of weekly competitions to win cars, saw shares crash

H&T Group climbed 15 per cent to 315p after it whacked up the dividend by 60 per cent in its interim results, The pawnbroker intends to return dividend distributions to historic levels as soon as trading returns to pre-pandemic levels.

Daily pledge levels are back to roughly 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels and continue to rise.

Previously high-flying Helium One Global came down to earth with a bump this week as it reported its drilling programme at the Rukwa helium project in Tanzania had encountered technical problems.

Wirelines logging of the uppermost interval of the first well drilled indicated good reservoir potential, with porosities of 15 to 20 per cent, but a petrophysical analysis indicated no free gas in this interval.

It was the only interval of the five that could be logged and tested further as the programme was hindered by poor and deteriorating hole conditions.

The shares, which a year ago were languishing at 4.25p, halved this week to 13.05p.

Another stock to halve was Best of the Best, the online organiser of weekly competitions to win cars.

The company had reported back in June that trading had softened since the UK had started lifting lockdown restrictions and this week it said it had seen a roughly 15 per cent fall in average weekly sales in the first 15 weeks of its new financial year compared to the preceding 15 week period (to 30 April).

The company has a fixed cost model so any dip in the top line hits the bottom line hard.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The last time flooring group James Halstead failed to raise its dividend was when Harold Wilson was Prime Minister. That was in the mid-1970s, some 45 years ago.

The board juggled payments last year in response to the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, but was ultimately able to raise the dividend to a new record of 14.25p, marking almost half a century of unbroken growth.

The decision reflects Halstead's culture as a family-style business that combines financial conservatism and product innovation.

Founded in 1915, the business is still run by a scion of the original family, Mark Halstead, and still operates out of Greater Manchester.

Set in stone: The last time flooring group James Halstead failed to raise its dividend was when Harold Wilson (pictured) was Prime Minister

Today Halstead's floors are sold to customers right across the globe, all the way from Scott Base in Antarctica to Svalbard Hotells in northern Norway.

The company invented vinyl sheet flooring, known as Polyflor, in the 1940s and this remains the cornerstone of its success, used in schools, stations, offices, shops and homes in 180 countries worldwide.

Hospitals are major customers too. About a quarter of Halstead's revenue comes from the healthcare sector and virtually every NHS trust uses its flooring, as do hundreds of Covid-care and vaccination facilities worldwide.

A focus on healthcare helped Halstead to withstand the worst effects of the pandemic, while its ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances allowed the firm to gain market share from larger rivals.

In a trading update earlier this month, Halstead said he expected record results for the year to June 30, 2021, with analysts looking for a 7 per cent increase in sales to £255million and an 11 per cent rise in profits to £49million.

Further growth should be forthcoming this year and beyond. The group has been making strong gains in America, with medical facilities particularly attracted to the firm's hard-wearing and well-priced vinyl flooring.

Other international markets are in Halstead's sights, too. Overseas expansion was curtailed during the pandemic, but is gradually regaining momentum and should deliver results as travel becomes less challenging.

Closer to home, Halstead's luxury vinyl tiles, which look like wood or stone, are increasingly popular among homeowners, not just in kitchens and bathrooms but also in home offices and gyms.

Like most manufacturers, the group has been hit by a shortage of raw materials, as well as higher shipping costs and absenteeism among employees exposed to the coronavirus.

While these may create some short-term issues, the firm's long-term prospects remain robust.

Midas verdict: Midas recommended James Halstead shares in November 2018 at £3.72. They have risen 55 per cent since then to £5.50 and should continue to gain ground. A proud British business with a global reputation, Halstead has repaid shareholders handsomely. A strong, long-term hold.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Today's the last day of Henley Royal Regatta, but if you’ve fallen for the Oxfordshire town and fancy a pad there, I have the home for you – a snip at a rumoured £50 million.

I’ve discovered that one of the area’s most exclusive estates has come on the market for the first time in 43 years – but it’s more of a small village than a house.

The 478-acre Burrow Farm Estate was bought in 1978 by insurance boss David Palmer, grandfather of Made In Chelsea star Olivia Bentley. He died in 2019, aged 92.

As well as 14 homes with two pools, the estate boasts 11 commercial units and a pheasant and partridge shoot.

Sadly, I’m a bit more than £49 million short of the asking price…

An estate owned by the grandfather of Made in Chelsea star Olivia Bentley, pictured, has been put on the market for an estimated £50 million

The estate, which was owned by Olivia's grandfather, insurance boss David Palmer, is located in Henley-on-Thames and features a Grade II listed manor house as well as almost 500 acres of land

The Blunt's beautiful news

I hear congratulations are in order for James Blunt and his wife Sofia, who are said to be expecting their third child.

Whispers in Mayfair reached me after sustainability expert Sofia, the granddaughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington, showed off her blossoming bump at a birthday party in members’ club George on Friday.

I’m sure that James and 38-year-old Sofia – who live in a stunning Ibiza villa for most of the year – will have famous pals queuing up to be godparents to the newborn.

It’s quite an honour – Ed Sheeran is a godparent to their eldest child, as was the late Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher.

The party, which is thrown annually by Klein, is a regular retreat for the A-listers and a chance for them to take in some pleasurable pampering.

The ultra-wealthy actresses and entertainers each are given a variety of expensive swag for free, and several stars were spotted pushing out massive Samsonite suitcases, which InStyle reported could be filled with as much as 80lbs of goodies.

The event seems to be quite the afternoon of fun as guests are treated to food and beverages as different parts of the property make for different experiences including a free outdoor swag bazaar in the backyard and pop-up boutiques in rooms that include a mix of shopping and gifting.

The celebrities can then end the day relaxing by the pool where there are spa treatments available.

Bold new look: Emme has been sporting a bold new green hairdo for the last few weeks after dying her naturally brunette locks an eye-catching shade

This is the 23rd year for the unmissable event, which continued last year despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

At that event, attendance was limited compared to previous years, and guests were required to be masked and to social distance at all times.

It's unclear if the guests list was curtailed again for 2021, though several guests were still seen wearing masks at various times.

It's considerably safer this year even with many people going unmasked, as many of the attendees are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

Cindy and Rande - who have Kaia, 19, and Presley, 22, together - initially put the house up for sale for $16 million in August 2020 before the price was slashed to $13.5 million.

The home has high ceilings, walls of glass and an open floor plan, according to Realtor.com, who also listed the property as having a double living room with a bar and eye-catching fireplace, as well as a gourmet kitchen with a centre island made of Calacatta marble.

The gated, one-acre lot has a motor court, a large pool and private walking paths, according to the listing.

Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency represented the seller and the buyer.

News of the house sale comes after Cindy and Rande purchased a new waterfront home in Miami Beach back in January.

The couple reported spent $9.6 million on the property, which has five bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms, and almost 4,000 square feet of living space.

But it takes just moments to realize the Oscar-nominated actor cherishes the unconditional love and friendship they bring to his life the most.

And over the weekend the Upstate New York native put his bond with one of his four-legged family members on display during a lunch date with a friend and his beloved pooch, King Carlos, in Beverly Hills.

Lunch date: Mickey Rourke, 68, appeared to be on the lookout for a friend before sitting down for lunch in Beverly Hills over the weekend

The Wrestler star went with his casual-cool look dressed in fitted blue jeans and a charcoal black hoodie without a shirt.

He stepped out in brown cowboys boots that were adorned with metal tips and a yellow design along the sides and heels.

The acclaimed actor ended up sitting in the outside patio of Mulberry Street Pizzeria with his beloved small white dog that's among his pack of pooches at home.

At one point, he was spotted giving Carlos a hug and a kiss.

During the afternoon outing, Rourke had his pal snap a photo of himself feeding King Carlos.

'King ""lCARLOS HAVING CHICKEN MEAT BALLS,' the Barfly leading man wrote in the caption, along with a series of heart emojis and a couple of hand emojis signifying his love for his beloved pooch.

Rourke has devoted much of his Instagram page to his endless devotion and welfare of dogs, which includes helping find forever homes for animals in need.

Rourke famously thanked his dogs when he accepted the Golden Globe for Best Actor for The Wrestler back in 2009.

'I'd like to thank all my dogs, the ones who are here and the ones who aren't here any more, because sometimes when a man's alone, all you got is your dog,' he said before adding, 'And they've meant the world to me.'

Earlier that year, during an interview, he credited his dogs for helping save his life when he contemplated suicide during one of the lowest points of life.

Along with his Oscar-nominated performance in The Wrestler (2008), Rourke's acting resume includes such acclaimed films as Diner (1982), Rumble Fish (1983), The Pope Of Greenwich Village (1984), 9 1/2 Weeks (1986), Angel Heart (1987), Barfly (1987), A Prayer For The Dying (1987), Sin City (2005), Domino (2005) and Sin City: A Dame To Kill For (2014).

And on Sunday the Mad Men alum sent her 1.1 million fans and followers into a frenzy once again by stepping up the sex appeal level with a series of photos where she flashes underboob in a peachy bikini.

'If only boring people are bored, I fear I may be boring,' the 43-year-old joked in the caption.

Next level: January Jones, 43, stepped up the sex appeal level and showed off some underboob in her latest series of bikini snaps she shared on Instagram on Sunday

The South Dakota native struck a pose in the peach-colored two-piece with her right leg on a chair in the first photo, which was seemingly taken in the yard of her Los Angeles home.

While the bottoms of the stylish number were moderate, the bikini top could barely hold in her burgeoning breasts.

She opted to go with a serious and stern look on her face in the first image, but changed her tune in the follow-up of the series by flashing a big beaming smile.

Jones covered up, ever so slightly, in a perfectly matched shirt that she left wide open to hold the attention firmly on her womanly curves.

She accessorized the ensemble with a few gold necklaces, matching earrings, and a pair of stylish sunglasses.

A third snap shared on her Insta-Story showed off more of her legs as she she again posed with her right leg on the chair and serious look on her face.

There was no shortage of fans and followers who were willing to react to her comment: 'If only boring people are bored, I fear I may be boring.'

'Boring never looked so good tho' was a common sentiment in the comments section.

Tasty: A third snap shared on her Insta-Story showed off more of her legs as she she still posed with her right leg on the chair and serious look on her face

Of course there were plenty of people who couldn't resist sharing their thoughts about her underboob with comments like, 'Underteat looking good, Jan!' and 'Not sure that fits but oh well f**k it dude.'

One concerned citizen shared her worry by writing: 'Hope that knot is tight otherwise the candy is out of the piñata.'

An obvious admirer kept it simple and sweet by writing, 'I'm not worried about you.'

Jones last starred in the Netflix drama series, Spinning Out, which premiered in January 2020 but was canceled just one month later.

She is currently shooting the action-thriller film God Is A Bullet, which is being directed by Nick Cassevetes and co-stars Jamie Foxx and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Shares in Hargreaves Lansdown were the biggest faller on the FTSE 350 today despite the DIY investing giant releasing strong results showing a boom in younger investors.

They slid 11.3 per cent to 1,454.5p on Monday after the firm revealed the growth in new customers caused operating costs arising from employing new staff, financial transactional charges and technology to rise significantly.

These burgeoning costs caused pre-tax profits to also decline by 3 per cent to £366million in the year to June 30, which was £17million lower than analysts' expectations, though they were 8 per cent higher on an underlying basis.

Youthquake: Hargreaves Lansdown's is increasingly attracting a younger clientele of investors. The median age of its client is now 46 compared to 58 in 2007

It attributed the increase in underlying profits to record equity trading levels, and rising investor confidence on the back of Covid vaccines and political certainty provided by the US election and the UK's departure from the European Union.

The Bristol-based financial services pioneer reported attracting 233,000 new clients during the year, with almost half of them between the ages of 30 and 54.

The median age of its clients is now 46 compared to 58 in 2007.

Much of the expansion in new customers came with the rise of the lockdown investor - a trend that saw more turn to the stock market as people were ordered to stay at home.

This was further fuelled by the frenzy around 'meme' stocks such as GameStop, which caused hundreds of millions in losses for short sellers earlier this year.

Far from being a swiftly passing fad, along with cinema chain AMC Entertainment, these two stocks have continued to be some of the most popular companies traded by Hargreaves Lansdown's clients over the summer months.

A total of 393 million online visits were made to the company's platform in the year, an expansion of 144 million on the year before and leading to a record 26.9 million transactions.

Equity trading consequently climbed to record levels, helping revenues rise by 15 per cent to £631million. Revenues from stock trading registered the highest growth, surging by around three-quarters to £258million.

Frenzy: Hargreaves Lansdown has attracted many new customers because of the 'meme stock' frenzy, which caused hundreds of millions in losses for short sellers earlier this year

New business inflows also jumped by 13 per cent to £8.7billion, the first time it has generated over £8billion in a single fiscal year. Meanwhile, its total assets under administration soared by 30 per cent to £135.5billion.

Chief executive Chris Hill said: 'This demographic change has been under way for some time across the industry but has become more noticeable through the pandemic.

'We are seeing younger clients show an interest in - and willingness to learn about - investing, prioritising financial resilience and saving. They are starting to benefit from the transition of wealth from older generations.'

Hargreaves Lansdown added that it now expects to continue benefiting from these trends in the long-term even though it expects trading to not 'remain at such high levels.'

It has noticed a slowdown in dealing volumes in activity since lockdown restrictions have eased and the UK entered its summer period but said this was in line with expectations and is forecasting higher client activity this year than pre-pandemic levels.

Analysts at Jefferies have warned though that the business faces increasing competition. 'With new and aggressive competitors joining the UK market, revenue margins falling and costs rising, the 2022 financial year will see these trends continue.

'Despite strong client recruitment and retention and clear market leadership, we think Hargreaves Lansdown may be vulnerable.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The stark North-South inheritance tax divide has been revealed by analysis showing two-thirds of estates hit by it lie in the south and east of the UK, with an average bill of £210,000.

In the 2018 to 2019 tax year, only 22,100 estates, or the equivalent of 3.7 per cent of deaths across Britain, triggered an inheritance tax bill, said NFU Mutual.

Of that tax take, 64 per cent comes from the South East, London, East of England, and South West, while a further 10 per cent comes from the East and West Midlands.

This means that all the northern regions, Wales, Scotland and Norther Ireland account for 25 per cent of the tax take.

How much? A map showing average inheritance tax bills across the country in 2018/19

The average bill on estates paying inheritance tax was up 6 per cent on the previous year.

But with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak having frozen the level at which people start paying inheritance tax for a further five years, many more are likely to fall in its scope in future, NFU Mutual has warned.

People in London had the highest inheritance tax bills in the country in 2018/19, forking out an average of £271,820, according to official figures.

The North West registered the lowest average inheritance tax bills in England, with residents in the vicinity forking out around £152,898 after the death of a loved one.

Only 252 people in Northern Ireland paid inheritance tax in the tax year in question, but had to fork out £40million between them, according to the data.

In Wales, 654 people were slapped with an inheritance tax bill in 2018/19, which came in at a total of £102million, or around £155,963.30 each.

Across Scotland, 1,190 people paid an inheritance tax bill totalling £233million over the period, forking out around £195,798.32 each.

On 3 March, Sunak froze two allowances for inheritance tax for a further five years, until 2026. This means the nil-rate band is staying put at £325,000 for the time being and the residence nil-rate band will be kept on hold at £175,000 until 2026.

Inheritance tax in brief Your estate is a combination of your property, savings, investments, other assets, wherever in the world they are held, and any gifts you give away in the seven years leading up to your death. Inheritance Tax is charged at 40 per cent on any part of an estate that exceeds individual allowances, known as the nil rate bands. The standard nil rate band is currently £325,000 per person, with no tax charged on assets left to spouses or civil partners. All of an unused nil rate band, or any unused part of it,ca n be passed on to a spouse or civil partner, so it is effectively doubled to £625,000 for couples. A further residence nil rate band is available to those who pass their home on to children or direct descendants, worth £175,000 each. The addition of this means a married couple or civil partners can pass on £1million inheritance tax-free, if they own a property worth at least £350,000. Analysts at Tilney warned there are catches: 'The allowance is tapered down for people with larger estates, reducing by £1 for every £2 that the estate is valued at over £2million. 'The residence nil rate band can only be used when passing on a residence to direct descendants and applies only to your home, not a buy-to-let property.'

The nil-rate band has been frozen at £325,000 per person since April 2009, so by April 2026 it will have remained unchanged for 17-years, during which house prices have risen sharply.

Jason Hollands, managing director at BestInvest, told This is Money: 'Had the allowance been indexed each year for consumer price inflation, it would be worth approximately £414,000 per person currently, so the impact of freezing the allowance has already been significant in real terms.

'The Chancellor’s declared freeze is therefore just extending that pain further.'

Sean McCann, chartered financial planner at NFU Mutual, said: 'Inheritance tax is feared by many but paid by relatively few.

'But with the average bill in excess of £200,000, it can make a significant dent in a family’s wealth for those that do get caught in the net.'

Mr McCann warned that more households will be caught by the inheritance tax net in future after Sunak froze the two inheritance tax thresholds to offset sky-high costs shelled out responding to the pandemic.

He said: With the tax-free allowances frozen for the next five years, rising asset prices and a heated housing market, a growing number of families will be impacted.

'It's critical that families concerned about being caught by inheritance tax seek advice as early as possible. The earlier you plan the more options you have to mitigate any potential bill.'

A recent survey by The Open Partnership found that 60 per cent of advisers expect demand for inheritance tax planning to rise over the coming year.

Speaking to This is Money, Ian Dyall, head of estate planning at Tilney, said: 'Rising property prices and any prospect of IHT reforms will be a real concern for many families, particularly for those forced to the sell homes of loved ones or other assets to pay a large inheritance tax bill.

'Fortunately, there are actions that individuals and families can consider taking now as part of their estate planning to mitigate against future changes to IHT rules.

'This could include lifetime gifting, using pensions to pass wealth on to the next generation and considering investments that qualify for Business Relief. Taking action early means more of your money going to your beneficiaries and less to the taxman.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Banks could face fines or be blocked from closing branches under plans to protect cash use.

City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is reportedly considering new rules to stop banks from shutting high street branches to ensure consumers and businesses can still access cash.

It comes as more than 4,200 branches have now shut since 2015 – with 801 closing since lockdown restrictions were enforced in March last year.

Campaigners have long called for urgent action to preserve coins and notes for the millions who rely on them.

Banks could face fines or be blocked from closing branches under plans to protect cash use (stock image)

Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged to introduce laws to protect cash access last year, and last month the Treasury finally launched a consultation into how the legislation could work.

Proposals include handing the FCA powers to fine banks that shut branches where they are most needed, and the regulator may even be allowed to enforce injunctions and stop some closures from going ahead at all.

The plans could also see nine out of ten neighbourhoods given the legal right to be within 0.6 miles of somewhere they can take out cash free of charge.

The consultation will run until September 23 but any new laws could take at least two years to enforce.

Industry experts have told Money Mail that the Treasury is unlikely to view cash machines as an equal replacement to the face-to-face service branches offer.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak (pictured) pledged to introduce laws to protect cash access last year, and last month the Treasury finally launched a consultation into how the legislation could work

The consultation also aims to ensure ‘reasonable access’ to places where people can deposit cash - a service which most ATMs outside bank branches do not provide.

Gareth Shaw, head of money at consumer group Which?, says: ‘The government’s proposal to put the FCA in charge of the cash system, including holding industry accountable for providing access, is a vital step. As cash machine and bank branch numbers continue to decline sharply, the government’s legislation plans cannot be introduced soon enough.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘We know that cash remains vital for millions of people and we are committed to protecting access to cash across the UK.’

A UK Finance spokesman said growing numbers of customers were turning to new technology to manage their money, including online and mobile banking.

But he added: ‘Technology is not for everyone and bank branches continue to play an important role in the life of local communities, meaning decisions to close them are never taken lightly.’

The money was lent from a linked restaurant company owned by the celebrity chef’s co-investors, Iceland bosses Sir Malcolm Walker and Tarsem Dhaliwal.

It followed four years of losses totalling £7.6million. D’Acampo’s restaurant chain was founded in 2015, with an initial branch at Manchester’s Corn Exchange.

In a pickle: Celebrity chef Gino D'Acampo's restaurant chain had to be rescued with a £12.9m bailout even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit

It has since branched out to eight sites in northern England and Birmingham, promising to be ‘the best Italian in town’.

The 45-year-old’s lavishly-furnished eateries promise ‘crowd-pleasing classics inspired by my travels and what’s in season’.

Suppliers are said to be ‘hand-picked’ to ‘ensure we are getting the finest meat, vegetables, herbs and fruits from here in the UK and Italia’.

Despite the chain’s financial woes, D’Acampo appears to be expanding his empire – having launched a business venture with Spanish hotel company Melia.

The chef has opened First Street Bar and Kitchen, at Melia’s INNside hotel in central Manchester and there are plans for further restaurants at Melia hotels around the UK.

Separately, D’Acampo’s My Pasta Bar business, which has two branches in central London, is £5million in debt.

It also appears to have been bailed out by businesses controlled by Walker and Dhaliwal.

The My Pasta Bar branch in Leadenhall Market in the City was still decorated with its logos but a sign was hanging in the window, apologising for its closure until further notice due to coronavirus. An identical notice hung in the window of the Fleet Street restaurant.

A source said: ‘As to why Gino’s restaurants have lost so much money, I don’t really know.

‘I would guess the relationship between him, Sir Malcolm and Tarsem Dhaliwal is pretty fraught, given the losses and the fact he’s gone away opening these new restaurants with someone else now. The losses must have gone up even more because of the pandemic.’

Gino D’Acampo Worldwide Restaurants Limited made losses of £997,000 in 2017, £530,000 in 2018, £2.9million in 2019 and £3.1million in 2020.

Accounts for 2020 show Gino D’Acampo Worldwide Restaurants owed £12.9million to Individual Restaurants – which runs Piccolinos and The Restaurant Bar and Grill. The sum is believed to include a bank loan of £7.125million taken out in 2019.

Walker, Iceland’s founder and executive chairman, controls Individual Restaurants along with Dhaliwal, managing director of the frozen food supermarket chain.

Despite small annual operating profits of around £2million, exceptional items resulted in Individual Restaurants Limited making pre-tax losses of £10.2million over three years between 2017 and 2019. It has not yet filed accounts for 2020.

The company, which has more than 40 branches, was subject of a pre-pack administration deal last November.

It was bought by another firm controlled by Walker and Dhaliwal and its head office moved to Iceland’s headquarters in Flintshire, North Wales.

Steven Walker, managing director of Gino D’Acampo Worldwide Restaurants and Individual Restaurants – who is no relation of Sir Malcolm – said: ‘The restaurants have been trading well since they reopened.’

He said the £12.9million bailout was simply ‘a transaction within the group’.

D’Acampo is the sole director of his pasta bar business. The company, The Pasta Bar Specialists, has borrowed heavily.

Its 2019 accounts reveal £4million of loans from Steven Walker, Gino D’Acampo Worldwide Restaurants and The Restaurant Bar and Grill. Walker and Dhaliwal did not wish to comment. D’Acampo did not respond to requests for comment.

Radford, the swinging sixties coachbuilder best known for creating bespoke Minis for the Beatles, Peter Sellers and other celebrities, has made a comeback in 2021 - and its first new model is going to be something a little special.

Under the guise of new owners, who include 2009 F1 champion Jenson Button, TV vehicle restorer Ant Anstead and designer Mark Stubbs, it has unveiled its Radford Type 62-2 - a modernised road-legal version of the 1969 Lotus Type 62 racer.

Just 62 examples will be built and they are set to be so unique and tailored to each customer that Radford says it can't put a price on it.

Radford's reimagined racer for the road: This is the new Type 62-2, the returning coachbuilding brand's bespoke new model based on the iconic Lotus Type 62

The reborn brand showcased its plans for the boutique-built motor this weekend at the Lyon Air Museum in Orange County, California.

The supercar will be powered by a supercharged 3.5-litre V6 engine currently used in the Lotus Exige and will mark the first Radford coachbuilt creation for more than half a century.

It will be sold in three varying specifications, with the choice of levels of performance - and pricing - depending on how extreme you want your sixties racing car for the road to be.

An entry-level 'Classic' trim option comes with 430bhp and a six-speed manual gearbox.

It will be sold with forged alloy wheels - 17 inches up front and 18 inches at the rear - and use adjustable coilover suspension, Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres and AP racing brake calipers and iron discs.

There will also be a unique electronic stability programme to modulate power and grip designed by Bosch.

The entry version is called the 'Classic' and will feature the Lotus V6 engine with 430bhp and a six-speed manual gearbox

The mid-spec option is the 'Gold Leaf' will have its six-cylinder engine upgraded to 500bhp with the addition of stronger con-rods, new pistons, more aggressive camshafts, a remapped ECU and a titanium exhaust system

The mid-tier version is called the 'Gold Leaf', which will sport the iconic red-and-white livery of Graham Hill's 1968 Lotus Type 49B Formula One racer.

The six-cylinder engine will be upgraded to a more potent 500bhp output with the addition of stronger con-rods, new pistons, more aggressive camshafts, a remapped ECU and a titanium exhaust system.

Customers will get the option of a sharp-shifting seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox.

It also receives upgraded two-piece forged aluminium wheels that are an inch larger in diameter on each axle compared to those fitted to the Classic trim - though are still lighter.

A motorsport-derived traction control and ABS system - honed by Jenson Button - will also feature to control the extra engine performance.

Radford confirmed in July that it had purchased the rights to use the legendary John Player Special - or JPS - black and gold livery

The most powerful Type 62-2 is a 'JPS' version with 600bhp and the same stunning livery used on Emerson Fittipaldi's championship-winning Lotus-Ford 72D, pictured here during practice for the Grand Prix of Great Britain at Brands Hatch on 15 July 1972

Finally, the top grade examples will be the 'JPS' variants.

Having recently purchased the rights to use the legendary John Player Special black and gold livery, Radford will use the stunning scheme used on Emmerson Fittipaldi's 1972 championship-winning Lotus Type 72D F1 car for its most powerful 600bhp Type 62-2 with all the bells and whistles.

While the top-spec gets the same chassis setup as the Gold Leaf version it has even lighter carbon composite wheels, monobloc calipers and carbon ceramic brake discs.

The team behind the limited-run car promise that the V6 engine will make a decent rumble, too.

'The sound of the Type 62-2 even at idle is something really special. But when you begin to explore the rev range further up, it becomes incredible, raising the hairs on the back of your neck and putting a big smile on your face,' Button says.

'However, the unique thing about this engine is that we've kept it pure, no exhaust valves, no trickery of any kind – what you hear is uncorrupted and utterly authentic – just like every single element of the driving experience.'

Underpinning each model will be a Lotus platform, with a modified version of the bonded aluminium chassis from the Elise and Exige sports cars.

Only 62 examples of the Type 62-2 will be created, with production due to start at the end of this year and first deliveries arriving in early 2022

The bodywork will be almost entirely carbon composite while the cabin will also be wrapped in a carbon fibre roll-over crash to provide occupant protection in the event of an accident

The bodywork will be almost entirely carbon composite while the cabin will also be wrapped in a carbon fibre roll-over crash to provide occupant protection in the event of an accident.

The combination of lightweight materials means the Type 62-2 should tip the scales at around 1,000kg - which is about the same as a Volkswagen Up! city car.

That means, in the most extreme JPS guise, the 600bhp-per-tonne ratio will be better than the V8 Mclaren 675 LT (564bhp per tonne), V12 Pagani Huayra Roadster (589bhp per tonne) and even the quad-turbo W16 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse (595bhp-per-tonne).

To improve both stiffness and how well it stick to the road in the bends, Radford will fit a bespoke - and sophisticated - tubular rear subframe that is promised to be a welded piece of art that's visible from the back of the car.

Like you'd find on most race cars, the underside of the new Type 62-2 is completely flat.

This is designed to channel air towards the rear diffuser to generate downforce at high speeds.

As a result, the Classic version does without a spoiler at all, while the Gold Leaf and JPS will have just a pair of small ducktails at each rear quarter. However, the JPS example will have a larger rear diffuser and front splitter to generate more load into the tarmac.

The Gold Leaf and JPS versions will both feature small ducktail tips on the rear quarters, which mimic those featured on the original Lotus car

Radford is best known for coachbuilt cars, especially bespoke Minis in the 1960s. Left: Britt Ekland received a one-off Radford Mini from her husband Peter Sellers for her birthday in 1965. Right: John Lennon pictured in his bespoke Radford Mini

Commenting on the project, Jenson Button explained: 'Creating a car that is simultaneously luxurious and comfortable, and great to drive, is a tough challenge, but the first Radford of the modern era delivers.

'Type 62-2 is a driver's car at its heart – when you see the design, it looks just like a 70s Le Mans car. And when you sit behind the steering wheel and look through the curved windscreen, you can see the front wheel arches – something you just don't experience on road cars today.

'With such a low centre of gravity, the car's body doesn't roll. The chassis exhibits all the hallmarks of a beautifully set up race car for the road – gifting the driver supreme confidence to extract maximum enjoyment every journey.'

Radford's design will remain true to the original Lotus's compact dimensions and will stand just 1,133mm tall - that's only fractionally higher than an original Ford GT40 and makes the Type 62-2 one of the shortest models on the market.

Stood alongside the car on which it's based, you might struggle to tell them apart at first glance - that includes the like-for-like doors, which will cut into the roof panel like a sixties endurance racer.

While this is a great period feature, it could cause problematic for taller drivers to get in and out. Jeremy Clarkson famously bought a modern-era GT40 in 2005 and struggled not only to get in but also to close the doors due to the lack of headroom.

Clarkson sold the car at the RM Sotheby's Monterey sale in 2017 for $379,500, having covered just 60 miles in the supercar.

The wing mirrors look like those on the original car but feature cameras mounted inside their housings that relay live images to the driver via small screens on each A-pillar so they can see what's going on around them

The Type 62-2 will stand just 1,133mm tall, making it one of the lowest cars to enter the market in recent history. The two doors will also have sections that cut into the roof panel, just like a sixties endurance racer

Jenson Button is not only one of the owners of the revitalised Radford brand but also in charge of making sure the bespoke supercars offer the best driving experience

Modern upgrades include LED headlights - which have been designed to look like the original lamps - and a connecting LED bar between the two brake light clusters.

It also gets wing mirrors that are similar in shape to those on the original car but feature cameras mounted inside their housings that relay live images to the driver via small screens on each A-pillar so they can see what's going on around them.

Inside, Radford promises creature comforts including a five-speaker stereo, digital rear-view camera and six-inch digital instrument cluster.

For those customers intending to take their Lotus remake back to the track, there's a built in data logger and configurable displays the simplify the digital instrument cluster to show speed, gear selection and lap times for when they're hurtling around a circuit.

Each version will also be sold with an optional power nose lift system, which raised the front of the car so it can clear speed bumps and difficult angles for car parks and sloped driveways.

Customers will also get the opportunity to increase the bespoke purchase price with the addition of matching custom luggage from Mason and Sons, which slots under the front clamshell.

The returning car brand says buyers will work closely with its design team to select every element of their bespoke vehicle, from the upholstery finishes, paint colours and aero features on the bodywork.

It's for this reason it says it can't make the price of the cars publicly known.

Stubbs said: 'Coachbuilding in the modern era utterly liberates an automotive designer. Advances in technology have ushered in a new era of this historic craft, making it possible to achieve levels of quality and design never before possible and deliver them in an extremely short time.

'This enables us to evoke the spirit of an iconic car with stunning authenticity and offer owners the ultimate in customisation. However, while Type 62-2 elicits the original Type 62 Lotus hallmarks, it sets its own path as a Radford model – it's all about creating a feeling of driving something timeless. Something that doesn't look or feel like anything else on the road.'

Production of the Radford Type 62-2 begins in late 2021, with first deliveries being made in the first quarter of 2022.

Anstead added: 'Only 62 Radford Type 62 models will ever be built. No two will be exactly alike, and each will be an exceptionally rare sight on the world's roads.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Kirsti Overton and her partner Chris Penfold bought their £150,000 three-bedroom flat, they were over the moon finally to own a home together. But five years on, they have been forced to sell up because their service charges have nearly tripled.

A Money Mail investigation today reveals how some firms appointed to manage properties are cashing in while leaseholders are seeing bills soar to unaffordable levels.

There are also fears that residents are being hit with rising charges by mistake. Some firms have been forced to refund residents tens of thousands of pounds after charges were found to be unjustified or made in error.

Forced to sell up: Chris Penfold and Kirsti Overton

Kirsti and Chris first paid £1,473 a year to cover costs associated with the block of 25 apartments in Newcastle upon Tyne. Fast-forward to 2021 and their manage-­ ment agent, Kingston Property Services, has now said they must pay £4,140 — more than eight times the cost of their monthly mortgage. Kirsti, 33, says: ‘We have never been able to save anything because we are always having to pay these bills. It’s so stressful not knowing how high they could end up in the future.’

But estate agents have warned the couple that they may not be able to find a buyer willing to take on the high fees. Experts say rip-off service charges levied by unregulated firms could be the next scandal to blight the housing market. The Leasehold Advisory Service, which offers free legal advice, says one in four inquiries are about costly service charges.

EVER HIGHER VARIABLE COSTS

Service charges are supposed to go towards maintaining the building and any communal areas, such as the garden or car parks. In some developments, water rates and building insurance premiums may also be covered. Luxury apartment blocks may also expect residents to foot the bill for concierge staff, swimming pools and gyms. Charges usually range between £1,000 and £2,000 a year.

Fees totalling more than £5,000 a year would be considered excessive, according to property experts at HomeOwners Alliance. Landlords typically employ managing agents to look after properties and collect service charges from the leaseholders. In the past fees were usually fixed, but today more leases now allow for ‘variable’ charges, which mean fees can be increased to cover rising costs and inflation. Experts warn that unscrupulous firms are hiking fees to rake in extra profit.

Amelia Murray purchased a flat with her brother three years ago. But she says: 'We never would have gone ahead had we known what a costly nightmare we faced dealing with the building’s managing agent'

Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, says: ‘Leaseholders remain at the mercy of their free-­ holders and their managing agents and continue to be used as an end-­ less cash cow. We know our homes need maintenance but having no control over these costs is like writing a blank cheque.’

Paula Higgins, chief executive of consumer group HomeOwners Alliance, says buyers of newbuild properties are at particular risk. She adds: ‘Developers can set service charges unrealistically low to tempt buyers into going through with a purchase. Once a managing agent takes control of the development, it will usually hike the fees to meet actual costs.’

Generous commission paid out to brokers for home insurance is also driving up the cost of premiums for leaseholders. Harry Scoffin, of the charity the Leasehold Knowledge Partner-­ ship, says: ‘Average commissions of around 40 per cent of a leaseholder’s premium is a common consumer grievance in the sector. ‘And there is no law that compels the freeholder or broker to reveal this information to the leaseholder who foots the bill.’

HOW THE BILLS QUICKLY ADD UP

In Kirsti and Chris’s case, the cause of the rising bills appears to be down to huge increases in the amount of money the firm has spent on repairs, increasing from £3,801 in their first year to an estimated £8,000 needed for 2021. Jobs include servicing floors, lights, windows and fixing leaks in the red-brick listed building. Residents also pay into a ‘reserve fund’, which is for more expensive jobs such as replacing a roof.

But while they contributed £5,000 in 2016, they are now being asked to pay in £14,500. Other costs include a £5,135 annual cleaning bill and a £495 accountancy fee. The firm also charges a management fee to cover its own services and staff. This has risen by 10 per cent to £6,775 since they moved in.

Andy and Siobhan Masterson, both 50, used to pay £800 a year for their two-bedroom flat in Sutton, Surrey, but since the freehold was purchased by another landlord their fees have soared to £3,509. New agent Eagerstates has commissioned more than £10,000 of work — and each time a job costs leaseholders more than £250, it charges a 15 per cent management fee. Eagerstates says it had to ‘pick up the slack’ left by the previous agent to ‘bring the property up to date and compliant with laws’.

How I plotted escape Amelia Murray: My brother and I bought a flat together three years ago. But we never would have gone ahead had we known what a costly nightmare we faced dealing with the building’s managing agent. The first bill arrived months after we moved in. There are two flats in the building and between us we were billed £7,717 for ‘external decorating’ - including a £1,177 management fee. When we asked local builders for quotes, they came in at less than half the cost. Yet we paid out the money and wrote it off as a bad experience. But the bills kept coming and over the next few months we and our neighbours were each invoiced £467 for an asbestos survey we did not need, £400 for a fire safety check and £400 for a fire safety sign. We were also charged £1,493 a year for buildings insurance. So we decided to take matters into our own hands and ask to buy the freehold for the building, which meant we could organise any work needed ourselves. But we were told we would have to pay a £420 fee just to get a response from the firm. Alternatively, we could apply for the Right To Manage (RTM). Under the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, leaseholders can replace their management company with themselves or another firm. The Leasehold Advice Centre helped us prepare and serve notices, complete title searches and register the RTM. It took five months and cost £834. We still pay annual ground rent but have more than halved our insurance cost and are no longer on the hook for any more shock demands.

A Kingston Property Services spokesman says the building’s age means more needs to be spent on repairs and saved for future works. He adds: ‘The management fee is fixed and therefore unaffected by the amount of works commissioned for the building.’

NEXT CHAPTER OF THE SCANDAL?

It is not the first time Britain’s 4.5 million leaseholders have felt exploited by profit-hungry businesses. For years, they have been forced to pay punitive ground rents to firms that own the land their home is built on. In January, after a Daily Mail campaign to end toxic leaseholds, ministers pledged to scrap the archaic charges for millions. The new rules followed an investigation by the Competition & Mar-­ kets Authority (CMA), which uncovered ‘troubling evidence’ of potentially unfair terms and misselling. Housing developer Persimmon has since agreed to sell free-­ holds to leaseholders at a discounted price. Aviva said it would refund up to 1,000 families whose ground rent bills had doubled.

Pressure is now piling on other developers and investment firms that bought freeholds to follow suit. But leaseholders are still not protected against sky-high service charges. The CMA said it had received complaints about costs rapidly escalating and home­owners billed for work not carried out. It warned: ‘A service charge should be compensatory, rather than a means of making a profit.’

In September 2020, the CMA said: ‘The wide variety and high cost of these charges can often take homeowners by surprise and leave them feeling vulnerable, frustrated and exploited in their own homes.’ Cross-party peer Lord (Richard) Best co-wrote a report with industry professionals in 2019 calling for management agents to be licensed and unscrupulous firms fined.

He says: ‘We urgently need a regulator because people just don’t know the score about these firms. Leaseholders have nowhere to go if something goes wrong.’

But ministers are yet to introduce new laws on service charges and, until then, the CMA cannot address the issues it has identified. Yet in Scotland managing agents, known as property factors, are regulated. Leaseholds are also banned in Scotland and residents in a block of flats can vote to fire a factor if they wish.

BATTLE OVER BOTCHED BILLS

Bungling firms have also been billing homeowners incorrectly — leading to some residents winning back tens of thousands of pounds. Last week the Financial Times revealed widespread errors in how service charges are calculated by major housing firms. Insurance giant Aviva has agreed to refund leaseholders of a luxury central London development more than £300,000, the newspaper reported.

Yet residents, who trawled through documents to find they had been billed £200,000 for Christmas lights over three years, say they have found more than £2million in possible charge errors over five years. Meanwhile, Optivo, one of the UK’s largest housing associations, admitted residents of its over-55s block in Kidbrooke Village, SouthEast London, had been over-­ charged by £20,000 a year for gas and agreed to refund them a total of £143,000.

Roger Edwards and his neighbours spent hours checking bills from One Housing Group (OHG), which is landlord to more than 35,000 people. The 64-year-old lawyer and his partner Paula Edwards, 49, bought their new-build two-bed-­ room flat in Wandsworth, SouthWest London, for £440,000 in 2015. And in 2016, the block of 31 flatowners received an estimated service bill of £37,573. But OHG ended up charging them £51,319.84 for the year of which Roger had to pay £1,796.

So Roger and his neighbours got together to ask OHG for con-­ tracts, invoices and receipts on a variety of expenses including CCTV maintenance, rubbish collection and repair jobs. After fail-­ ing to provide receipts for materials purchased for work, the company agreed to credit them with refunds totalling more than £11,500. The firm agreed to refund another £14,000 after further challenges of the 2019 accounts.

Roger and his neighbours have since taken over their bills and appointed a new managing agent after successfully applying for Right To Manage. He says: ‘By the end of it we had completely lost trust in the company, which at best was clearly incompetent.’

In 2019, OHG had to refund 12 residents £246 after it charged them for maintaining a nonexistent lift for nine years. At the time it apologised for the errors on the bills for the block in Reading, Berkshire. It is understood bulkbought products made it difficult for OHG to provide receipts. Its chief operating officer Chyrel Brown says: ‘Our service charges are based on reasonable costs incurred and there are clear mechanisms for leaseholders to query or dispute them. We apologise for any errors that have occurred.’

When David Watson moved into his one-bedroom flat in Camber-­well, South London, in 2016, he was paying £118 a month to housing association London & Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q). But the fees have been hiked every year since. By April they had more than doubled to £320.98. The company wrote to residents to say it would be hiking cleaning costs after re-measuring their communal areas, before admitting these bills should have been capped at £100 all along and that the letters had been sent in error. Yet even after receiving a £1,304.20 refund, David, 41, says: ‘We feel like we are stuck with a company which is failing to check how it is spending other people’s money.’

An L&Q spokesman says: ‘We have refunded leaseholders for charges above this cap, and are writing to them to apologise for our error, explain what happened and put things right.’ Optivo says it became aware of inconsistencies when it took over the block in 2017 and that it has addressed them with a ‘lengthy and thorough review’. Aviva disputes the £2million figure, but confirmed it had refunded leaseholders after ‘historic service charge errors by the estate’s managing agents’ were identified.

It is not the first time Britain’s 4.5 million leaseholders have felt exploited by profit-hungry businesses

OWNERS CAN TAKE CONTROL

Leaseholders must be offered the chance to find a cheaper quote but agents are not obliged to go with a different option. There is not a free ombudsman resolution service for leaseholders seeking to challenge service charges. But leaseholders can take their landlords to the FirstTier Tribunal (Property Chamber) if they believe the fees are not ‘reasonable’.

You can also apply to the tribunal to appoint a different managing agent. Your case will be heard by a panel, which may assess whether the agents are in serious breach of conduct set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. But there is a minimum £300 fee. You may have to foot your landlord’s legal bills if you don’t win.

Another option is to submit a notice to the First-Tier Tribunal of an intention to buy a share of the freehold so you can manage the property with your neighbours. But you will need to get at least half of the other leaseholders on board and hire a surveyor to value the price of your share. And a landlord can serve a counter-notice, which can result in a lengthy and costly process.

Anna Scoffin’s service charge bills have soared by more than £10,000 in the past eight years, from £16,426 a year when the building was under a previous agent to £26,520 today. But she cannot legally buy her freehold share because a business takes up more than 25 per cent of her Canary Wharf skyscraper. Anna, 55, says: ‘It’s a horrific situation when you’re faced with spiralling charges.’

A cheaper option is Right to Manage. Again, you need at least half of your neighbours to agree and a solicitor to help you send notice to your landlord of your intention. If the firm tries to block your request, you go to the FirstTier Tribunal. The Government also wants to make it easier for leaseholders to become commonholders, which would allow them to look after their own blocks.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Coventry Building Society has launched a best buy easy-access savings account today paying 0.55 per cent.

This rate nudges it as the outright top deal in the independent This is Money savings tables, above Marcus Bank, Cynergy Bank, Leeds Building Society and Saga, which all offer 0.5 per cent.

The account from Britain's second biggest mutual is a limited access account – that is, money can be withdrawn a maximum of six times a year.

Top rate: Coventry Building Society has launched a top paying easy-access savings rate

Cash in the account is protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and it can only be opened and managed online. Accounts can be opened with £1.

However, Daniel McDonald, senior savings product manager at Coventry, warns that the account is likely to prove popular – which indicates it might not stick around for long.

He said: 'We're expecting it to be popular with savers, who are looking to take advantage of a market-leading rate while still having access to their funds if they need to.

'The account is ideal for savers looking for a place to save their rainy-day fund or who are saving up for something specific, who don't want to lock their money away but don't expect to need constant access to it.'

The move could help stimulate competition in the easy-access market.

Rates on bread and butter accounts have been in the doldrums for some time.

Marcus was the main driver of easy-access rates pre-pandemic, with billions of pounds pouring into the Goldman Sachs-owned UK bank as it sat on top of the best buy tables since launch in summer 2018.

However, a flood of deposits during the pandemic left it close to breaking regulatory limits, meaning for a while, it pulled the account.

Meanwhile, savers have seen an increase in better-paying fixed-rates in recent months, with more providers competing in that area.

Average fixed rates rose monthly for the first time since October 2020, according to Moneyfacts data earlier in the week, while choice grew to the highest number seen this year.

But despite that, rates on all accounts - easy-access, fixed-rates and Isas - are way down on pre-pandemic levels, meaning savers are struggling to find a return on their cash, especially with inflation riding above 2 per cent.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Average asking prices for homes fell for the first time in 2021 in the last month, new data from Rightmove has revealed, amid the ending of the primary phase of the stamp duty holiday.

Property price tags have fallen an average £1,076 since mid-July - or 0.3 per cent - driven by a 'cooling' at the higher end of the market, according to the website.

The typical asking price for a home across the country stands at £337,371, down from £338,447 in July.

At the top of the property ladder, average asking prices have slipped by nearly £4,700 in the last few weeks, to £616,421.

Shifts: A chart showing average property asking prices in Britain since August 2020

Mapped: A map showing what's happening to property prices around the country

On an annual basis, average asking prices are still 5.6 per cent higher than they were a year ago, down slightly on the 5.7 per cent increase the previous month.

'Our analysis shows that average prices have only fallen in the upper-end sector, which is usually more affected by seasonal factors such as the summer holidays and has also seen the greatest withdrawal of stamp duty incentives', Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said.

He said stamp duty holiday savings were now typically no more than £2,500, adding that the window to take advantage of this saving by buying now and completing by the end of September has 'pretty much closed.'

Buyers now have to pay for stamp duty on purchases above £250,000, down from the £500,000 threshold during the main phase of the tax holiday.

During the pandemic, many prospective buyers have been on the hunt for a property with more outdoor space, and recent figures from Halifax last week suggest that the price of a detached house has risen by around £46,000 in a year.

Trends: A chart showing five-year average asking price trends

Rightmove said the number of homes coming up for sale remained at 'record lows', with buyers often battling to buy the same property.

While asking prices in the upper end of the market appear to have cooled, the 'mass-market' of homes for first-time buyers and second-steppers has held firm, the data suggests.

For first-time buyers, average asking prices have jumped by 3.7 per cent in the past few weeks, hiking the price tag from £207,386 to £208,714.

And, for people buying their second property, average property price tags have risen by 6.6 per cent to £309,643 in the past year, up from £308,668 a year ago.

Rightmove thinks there will be a further 'autumn bounce' in both seller activity and property prices in the coming months, with the chance of finding a buyer 'at, or close to, an all-time high.'

The time taken for a home to be 'sold subject to contract' was now just 36 days, Rightmove added.

It said buyer enquiries were still 56 per cent higher than by the same point back in 2019, and down 17 per cent from the 'frenzied' post-lockdown 2020 numbers.

The data showed that the number of sales agreed was 9 per cent higher than back at the same point in 2019.

Mr Bannister said: 'Sell before you buy is a successful tactic in fast moving markets, especially the current one where any new listings popular in both specification and location are selling in days rather than weeks.'

He added: We also anticipate that more property will come to market when future when owners have more clarity over their employers' long-term balance of home and office working.'

Toby Philips, managing director of Countrywide, said: 'The UK property market continues to defy expectation, with houses continuing to sell faster than ever.

'Although we're seeing glimmers of a downturn in house prices as a result of the tapered stamp duty holiday deadline, we're seeing this predominately in the premium end of the market.

Price tags: Percentage monthly change in average asking prices over time

'Across out Southern region in particular we're seeing a continued surge in the volume of new buyers looking to purchase the limited housing stock available.

'This is creating a fast moving, favourable market for sellers. We can see little sign of this abating and would go as far as predicting an Autumn bounce in prices if buyer demand continues as it is.'

He added: 'At Bairstow Eves, we've never seen a seller's market quite like this.'

Nick Barnes, head of research at Chestertons, said: 'August tends to be a quieter month but, in line with Rightmove’s analysis, buyer interest has remained strong and sales in the first half of August were 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.

'Chestertons also noted a 45 per cent reduction in the number of properties coming onto the London market, which inevitably creates competitive market conditions.

''As a result, we have seen a 49 per cent decrease in the number of sellers willing to drop their asking prices during the first half of August 2021 compared to this time last year.'

'I re-started a couple of times, but third time lucky I made it with determination,' Jasmine told FEMAIL.

What is involved in '75HARD'? * Two 45 minute workouts, one of which has to be outdoors. * Four litres of water daily. * Dedicated meal plan. * Read 10 pages of a self-development book. * No cheat meals or alcohol. * Regular progress photos every day. * Take a five-minute cold shower every day. * Perform other unrelated tasks like a random act of kindness or talk to someone in person daily. If you miss any task, you must go back to day one and start again. Advertisement

'The easy days were easy and the hard days were hard, really hard.

'There were days when my body was tired and needed rest, weekends away and dinners out where I could have easily given up, but I stayed strong and truly did win the war with myself.'

The challenge includes two 45 minute workouts daily, one of which has to be outdoors, as well as a dedicated meal plan, four litres of water each day, no cheat meals and zero alcohol.

'75HARD' also requires you to read 10 pages of a self-development book every day and take regular progress photos.

'Before the challenge, I was sitting around 61.5 kilograms, whereas by the end I weighed 59,' Jasmine said.

'It wasn't a huge weight loss, but I went from 23 per cent body fat to 19.9 per cent, and gained 1.1 kilograms of muscle mass.'

The 29-year-old said she did the challenge because she is 'very good at starting things but never completing them'.

'I am also someone who never says no to a bar of chocolate or a slice of cake, so I wanted to show myself I have control over them,' she said.

Jasmine chose to follow a diet that suits her macronutrients - or her personal protein, carb and fat requirements.

Jasmine's healthy diet saw her tailoring her food to her macros; typically she'd eat something like protein oats for breakfast and stir fries for dinner (meals pictured)

The 29-year-old said she did the challenge because she is 'very good at starting things but never completing them', and because she has 'terrible eating habits'

Typically, she'd have something like protein oats for breakfast topped with fruit and sugar-free maple syrup.

Then, lunch was rice, vegetable sausages with vegetables and coconut siracha.

'Dinner was a noodle stir fry or a homemade miso ramen,' Jasmine said.

'Sometimes I'd have a vegetable sausage and mashed potatoes - this became a go-to as I love big home-cooked dinners.'

While she missed her favourite cheat meals like hot chips and pizza, by making delicious healthy foods at home, Jasmine was able to get through the 75 days.

Jasmine said she is delighted with the results of the challenge, and even though it was a 'rollercoaster', she would recommend it to anyone.

'It's really useful as I've managed to keep some of the habits from the challenge,' she said.

'I didn't drink for five months and have managed to keep that going, I rarely drink now. I want to get back to drinking four litres of water per day though - I felt so good doing that!'

The 29-year-old also shared her tips for others thinking they might like to try '75HARD'.

'I would definitely recommend listening to Andy's podcast talking about the challenge, as it really helps to give a good insight and understanding of what it is really about,' she said.

'I'd also recommend getting the app, as it makes it much easier to track your progress and tick everything off each day.'

Finally, Jasmine said you should try and get your workouts in 'early' and drink your water as early as possible too.

'I had a few too many trips to the toilet in the middle of the night!' she said.

England's Covid R rate had fallen to below one for the first time in three months, according to No10's top scientific advisers.

The UK Health Security Agency now estimates the reproduction rate - which reflects how quickly the virus is spreading - is between 0.8 and 1.0. Last week's figure was thought to be as high as 1.1.

But it is a lagging indicator and reflects the situation the country faced three weeks ago, when Covid cases began to shrink naturally. Since then, however, the outbreak has started to tick upwards once again, which some experts have blamed on the delayed effects of 'Freedom Day'.

More proof England's third wave is no longer fizzling out came from a major Covid surveillance study today, which estimated infections levelled off last week.

The Office for National Statistics, which carries out tens of thousands of random swab tests, said one in 75 people were carrying the virus on any given day in the seven-day spell ending August 6.

This was the equivalent of 726,700 people and was up slightly on the week before, suggesting the dip in infections seen throughout the end of July was only a temporary blip.

While the proportion of people testing positive in England 'continued to be high' at around 1.32 per cent, the ONS estimates suggest an 'overall decreasing trend over the past two weeks'.

But the figures come amid fears that this weekend will pose one of the biggest 'tests' since last month's Freedom Day, with 1.7million people expected to attend mass gatherings to watch sporting events and music festivals - the largest number since the first lockdown last March.

Crowds will gather in the largest numbers for Premier League matches, England’s cricket match against India at Lord’s and the Edinburgh Fringe festival.

Public Health England officials warned those attending events to arrive early or late to avoid big crowds and wear a mask in crowded places.

Is Spain heading for the red list? Surge in UK arrivals testing positive for Covid sparks fears tourist favourite could be put out of bounds to one million UK holidaymakers unless they quarantine afterwards Fears rose today that Spain could be forced on the the UK's quarantine red list, scuppering the holiday plans of more than a million UK holidaymakers. The number of people testing positive for Covid after returning from the Mediterranean hotspot has risen almost six-fold in the space of a month, figures released today show. Around one-in-35, or 2.9 per cent of those entering Britain from the amber list country in July tested positive, up from 0.9 per cent in June as the number of those tested doubled. That rate is almost double that of returnees from Greece and Portugal, which are also on the amber list. Advertisement

UKHSA's estimate of the R rate suggested the figure may be as low as 0.8 in every region of the country.

But it may still be above one in the East of England and the South West, according to the weekly update.

If the figure — the average amount of people every infected patient passes the virus on to — is below one, it means infections are shrinking.

The R rate is, however, a lagging indicator and does not reflect the situation currently because it is based on a wide mix of data, including deaths - which reflect how quickly the virus was spreading weeks before.

Ministers once put the R rate at the heart of their Covid battle plan.

But it is now less crucial because scientists care more about both hospitalisation and death rates, given the country's massively successful vaccination roll-out.

Meanwhile, the gold-standard ONS data - which is used by ministers to track the state of the outbreak - showed infection levels in England had started to level off again.

Covid was most prevalent in Northern Ireland, with one in 55 people (1.88 per cent) infected on any given day last week.

Scotland saw a drop in people testing positive, with one in 190 people having the virus (0.53 per cent).

Infection levels stayed low in Wales, where just one in every 220 people were infected (0.46 per cent). But the ONS statisticians claimed it was unclear whether cases were going up or down.

Within England, prevalence rates fell in the North East, North West, West Midlands and London.

The proportion of people infected with Covid rose the fastest in 16 to 24-year-olds, where 3.2 per cent tested positive up to August 6, compared to 2.5 per cent the week before.

Cases also went up in children aged between 2 and 11, jumping from 1.8 to 2.1 per cent, and in 25 to 34-year-olds, where 1.4 per cent tested positive, compared to 1.3 per cent seven days earlier.

Meanwhile, infection levels plateaued in children aged 12 to 15 (3.4 per cent), and over-35s.

But the ONS figures are also a lagging indicator due to how the estimates are made. People can test positive for several weeks after getting infected.

Whereas official daily figures look at new cases, and offer the most up-to-date view of the true state of the outbreak.

Department of Health statistics show cases have been creeping upwards over the past week, with 33,074 positive tests recorded yesterday - a 9.5 per cent rise on the figure from seven days earlier (30,215).

Experts are confused over what will happen next, but believe cases will rise in September when children go back to school.

It comes as up to 1.7milllion Britons are set to gather this weekend to watch football matches and attend festivals, music concerts and the theatre.

And venues are not required to check whether people are jabbed or have taken a negative Covid test - a rule that doesn’t kick in until October.

Nearly 400,000 fans will be attending 10 Premier League matches in England and 85,000 more will be going to cup and league games in England, Scotland and Wales, the i reported.

Other events sure to draw a crowd include England’s test match against India at Lords and the Edinburgh Fringe festival. In addition to these events, around 300,000 people will be going to other arts and music festivals, the i says.

Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: 'The football season is back underway, and I know many people are excited to be back in a ground for the first time in 18 months.

'Everyone should be able to go to a sporting event, have fun and enjoy it safely.

'However, Covid has not gone away and there are a few things we can all do to reduce the risk. You might want to arrive early or late to help avoid large crowds and wear a mask particularly in enclosed and crowded spaces.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Public Health England was today accused of being 'away with the fairies' for claiming that Covid vaccines have prevented 23.4million infections.

The Government-run agency, which will be axed within a matter of weeks, yesterday released 'remarkable' updated estimates about how well the jabs have worked.

As well as drastically curbing the spread of the coronavirus, the PHE data suggested vaccines have saved more than 84,000 lives and prevented almost 67,000 hospital admissions.

But experts today questioned the maths behind the estimate.

Professor David Livermore, a microbiologist at the University of East Anglia, said the jabs have undoubtedly thwarted the spread of Covid and saved tens of thousands of lives.

But he told MailOnline it 'cannot possibly be correct' that more than 20million cases were stopped.

Vaccines are thought to cut infections by around 60 per cent, so in order for them to have prevented 23.4million, the UK would have had to have seen approximately 17m cases among unvaccinated people since the start of the rollout, he explained.

There have only been 3.8million confirmed cases among the entire population since the start of the year — and most have been unvaccinated during that time.

Professor Livermore said: 'The 85,000 deaths prevented is plausible — it’d be a fifth of the care home population, who are the most vulnerable.

'But 23.4million infections prevented cannot possibly be correct. I find myself a little shocked that (the figure) isn’t getting a sanity check anywhere.

'It’s away with the fairies and whatever mathematical model has been used to project these numbers needs a serious review.'

PHE said its model is based on a worst-case scenario with no vaccines or lockdowns to protect the population. Sources at the health body said it is 'impossible to predict' how the pandemic would have played out without jabs in reality.

Graph shows: The number of hospitalisations in over-65s (brown line) plotted against the number of expected admissions without the vaccine programme (green line). The dotted lines show vaccine coverage in people aged 85 and above, 75 to 84 and 65 to 74 for first (D1) and second (D2) doses

Professor David Livermore, a microbiologist at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline it 'cannot possibly be correct' that more than 20million Covid cases have been stopped by vaccines

Why IS Public Health England's modelling being questioned? PHE yesterday claimed vaccines had prevented 23.4million people being infected in England. Vaccines are estimated to only prevent 50 to 60 per cent of infections, with their main role to prevent serious disease and death from the virus. In order for 23.4million to be prevented, there would have to have been 17million vaccinated people infected by that ratio. This means the model predicts without vaccines, there would have been just over 40million Covid cases in total. In reality, Britain only recorded 3.8million confirmed cases among the entire population since the start of the year. But the actual case numbers, published by the Government every day, are only based on positive tests. Not everyone who gets Covid will develop symptoms and ask for a swab. Advertisement

Professor Livermore claimed in order for the numbers to add up, there would have to have been 40million Covid infections if not for the vaccine in PHE's model.

He said: 'That’s 60 per cent of a UK population that’d already experienced the first and — substantially — second waves, generating significant natural immunity.

'Again, utterly implausible.'

But the actual case numbers, published by the Government every day, are only based on positive tests. Not everyone who gets Covid will develop symptoms and ask for a swab.

PHE said its real-time surveillance model — developed with the University of Cambridge — compares how the pandemic played out with vaccines to a counterfactual scenario where no vaccines had occurred.

But it also assumes the Government did not introduce a lockdown in January, meaning cases would have continued to soar after the second peak.

Sources admitted in reality, it is likely lockdown would have been extended and restrictions not eased on July 19 if not for the vaccine programme, which would have reduced the number of cases than what is predicted by the model.

The main purpose of vaccines is to prevent severe illness and death from Covid.

Experts have always been open that jabs are not 100 per cent effective at stopping mild infection. It is, for this reason, many believe herd immunity is impossible.

But PHE yesterday boasted it figures prove just how well the vaccines work at reducing cases.

Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE's head of immunisations, said: 'These figures show the vaccine programme’s remarkable impact on saving lives and reducing the spread of the virus.

'As cases have increased, the true scale of protection from the vaccine programme has become clear. Everyone who has come forward for the vaccine has played a part in this vital effort.

'It’s important people under 30 continue to take up the offer of the vaccine. Infection rates are highest in this age group and Covid can be serious for some.'

It came as teenagers as young as 17 were invited to book their first vaccine appointment if they are within three months of their 18th birthday.

In line with Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance issued last week, the NHS is already vaccinating people who are 16 and 17 with a single dose of the jab at GP and walk-in sites, and more than 16,000 in this age received theirs last weekend.

Vaccination sites across the country are working hard to complete the rollout with more than 300 sites already offering the jab to 16- and 17-year-olds including GP teams who began vaccinating eligible teens last week.

Children aged 12 to 15 who are clinically vulnerable or who live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus are also being contacted by the NHS and invited for their vaccine.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Despite reports claiming they were back together, it seems Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are still just co-parenting.

Rumors had been rife that the two were set to reconcile after making a number of appearances together lately, despite his alleged cheating scandals.

However, a source tells PageSix: 'They have a healthy co-parenting relationship - and they will be seen together with True. Not the first time, nor will it be the last. They are on the same page when it comes to their daughter.'

Not so fast! Khloe Kardashian NOT getting back with serial cheater Tristan Thompson for now... as sources say they have a 'healthy co-parenting relationship'

The source added that it's important for Khloé that 'True has a relationship with Tristan and that she sees her parents getting along.'

News of them getting back together had been reported by In Touch Weekly, amid Tristan's note about working on his growth and change, something which Khloe's sister Kim Kardashian gave her stamp of approval.

The duo most recently split in June 2021 amid allegations that he cheated on her again.

The outlet's source said: 'It may not be the most ideal situation because of her trust issues, but she's desperate to make it work and he's once again promised to do better.'

Adding that 'Khloe wants Tristan in True's life and she's still holding out hope for that second child. They are far from over.'

The insider noted: 'He also promised Khloe that things will be different this time around and that he signed with the Sacramento Kings to be closer to her and True, and be a proper family and she believes him.'

Back on? The on/off lovebirds are seemingly back on, according to In Touch Weekly

Dailymail.com reached out to her rep for comment.

On Saturday, Tristan sent out a cryptic message on the caption of his latest Instagram post: 'Some people will judge you for changing. Some people will celebrate you for growing. Choose your circle wisely.'

His talk of 'changing' and 'growing'' comes just one day after Kim liked the post and jokingly wrote that he is a 'Jamaican Canadian prophet.'

Tristan was born and raised in Canada, with both of his parents of Jamaican descent.

Last week, Khloe Khloe shared a snap of herself rocking natural curls; she said she had been straightening her hair for the past 20 years but when COVID hit, she stopped doing it.

Tristan added several heart emojis in the comments.

On Thursday, Khloe and Tristan were pictured leaving a special screening of Paw Patrol, which Kim Kardashian has a voice role in.

Khloe carried their daughter in her arms as Tristan walked besides her, holding goodies.

Flirty: Tristan was quick to add several heart emojis in the comment box, revealing he still likes to flirt with his pretty ex

On Thursday, it was announced that Tristan was traded to the Sacramento Kings from the Boston Celtics.

Interestingly enough, at the same time, Khloe shared a quote that read: ''Every situation in life is temporary. So, when life is good, make sure you enjoy and receive it fully.'

Tristan is moving to the West coast after one season playing for the Boston Celtics.

Instead of being across the country, Thompson will now be in Sacramento, California, about a six-hour drive from Kardashian's native Calabasas.

Last year Kardashian had to contend with the distance.

'I'm not opposed to Boston, but once you have kids, it's different,' Kardashian explained in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which aired in June.

'True has her whole life in L.A. — her cousins, I have preschool class at my house,' she said.

Coast to coast: Thompson has been traded to the Sacramento Kings from the Boston Celtics

'It's COVID, so I can't just take her to Boston and go find classes there. Everything's shut down.

'I think if it was a different year, maybe I'd be more open to uprooting her. But what am I going to do? Take her there to be in a condo there and stay inside some walls?'

The Sacramento Kings reportedly acquired Thompson from the Boston Celtics on Friday in a three-team trade that also included the Atlanta Hawks.

In addition to True, Thompson is father to Prince, four, whom he shares with his ex-girlfriend, model Jordan Craig.

Kardashian and the professional basketball player were first linked in 2016 when they were spotted spending time together at a nightclub, and they later took a vacation in Mexico.

Advice: On her Instagram Story, Khloe got more personal with several seemingly pointed quotes

The two confirmed that they were dating that same year and remained very close through much of 2017.

The reality television personality eventually confirmed that she was pregnant with the athlete's child that December through a post made to her Instagram account.

Kardashian revealed that she was expecting a girl during an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians that aired the following year.

In 2018, it was reported that Thompson was spotted kissing multiple women in several locations.

That year, she gave birth to True, and the parents later reconciled following the child's birth.

They reconciled soon after, confirming rumors they were back on in January 2019 while holding hands on a night out.

They split the following months after he allegedly cheated on her with Kylie Jenner's best friend Jordyn Woods.

In July 2020, they were reportedly trying to work on their relationship again, becoming official the following month.

They reportedly split again in June 2021 amid rumors that he allegedly cheated on her.

The longtime supermodel was spotted heading into the Little Beach House Malibu social club that's situated along the world famous Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu.

And along the way, the 40-year-old turned more than a few heads dressed, casually but stylish, in striped legging pants and a red hot blouse that she left unbuttoned just enough to showcase her ample cleavage.

R&R: Alessandra Ambrosio, 40, stepped out to a beachfront social club in Malibu on Sunday

In keeping with the theme of her ensemble, the model turned entrepreneur also wore a pair of flip flops and her long brown tresses were pulled back into a ponytail with a center part.

She also had a small blue box purse that hung over her right shoulder as she carried her phone that was attached to a crossbody lanyard.

The Little Beach House Malibu is a small private members' club for the creative community in Malibu and the surrounding coastal areas.

Turning heads: The longtime supermodel gave more than a hint of her cleavage dressed in a red hot blouse that was paired with striped legging pants

It's located in a stand-alone building that features outdoor terraces, a bar and a restaurant, all with ocean views.

The idea of the club is to make it as comfortable and relaxing as possible to help stimulate the creative juices of its members.

Earlier, the mother of two took to her Instagram Stories and offered a 'good morning' to her 10.4 million fans and followers with a photo of the waves crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean. The selfie also captured the side of her head.

She followed up with a sweet snap of herself giving her nine-year-old son Noah a kiss on the forehead.

But Rihanna tried to prove she still enjoys the simple pleasures like a relaxed late-night stop at the grocery store when she dropped by a Whole Foods location in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood on Sunday.

The 33-year-old hitmaker certainly looked like a member of the ultra-wealthy with strands of thick pearls and gold jewelry draped from her throat for the otherwise-casual outing.

A small golden cross was appended to the pearls, and other gold necklaces hung down to her midriff.

Rihanna put on a busty display in a simple black top, which she wore under her black jacket, which featured thick gold buttons.

She dressed down the rest of her ensemble with a set of high-waisted acid-wash jeans with blown-out knees and other shredded patches.

The 5ft8in Work singer wore a rare black-and-gold striped Chanel no. 5 belt with a thick dangling gold pendant.

Rihanna is now worth well over $1 billion, with Forbes estimating she's worth closer to $1.7 billion.

However, that vast majority of that worth is unrelated to the music that made her a household name.

Most of her wealth is related to her cosmetics company Fenty Beauty, which the publication confirmed she owns 50 percent of.

Her lingerie company Savage x Fenty reportedly makes up another $270 million of her wealth, and the rest of her fortune comes from her music career, as well as occasional forays into acting.

The women's-only party, which is thrown annually by producer Jennifer Klein, is a regular retreat for the A-listers and a chance for them to take in some pleasurable pampering.

The ultra-wealthy actresses and entertainers each are given a variety of expensive swag for free, and several stars were spotted pushing out massive Samsonite suitcases, which InStyle reported could be filled with as much as 80lbs of goodies.

The event seems to be quite the afternoon of fun as guests are treated to food and beverages as different parts of the property make for different experiences including a free outdoor swag bazaar in the backyard and pop-up boutiques in rooms that include a mix of shopping and gifting.

The celebrities can then end the day relaxing by the pool where there are spa treatments available.

Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Rodrigo, Christina Hendricks and Alexandra Daddario, were just a few of the major celebrities seen at the event.

This is the 23rd year for the unmissable event, which continued last year despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

At that event, attendance was limited compared to previous years, and guests were required to be masked and to social distance at all times.

It's unclear if the guests list was curtailed again for 2021, though several guests were still seen wearing masks at various times.

It's considerably safer this year even with many people going unmasked, as many of the attendees are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

'But they have to consider if that could have the knock-on effect of making life so difficult outside of the rehearsal studio that it might impact on their performances.'

MailOnline has contacted a Strictly representative for further comment.

Contestant: Giovanni ­was previously romantically linked to the actress (pictured) and there are fears it could create tension with his Maura

Katie and Giovanni were linked back in 2017 when it was reported that they'd enjoyed a night out with pals and 'dinner and the cinema' date.

However the Coronation Street actress, who played Sinead Tinker on the ITV soap, later shut down speculation and denied they were dating.

Maura and Giovanni first went public with their relationship at Sapphires, Blackpool's Premier Drag Cabaret Show Bar at the beginning of July.

And he's already introduced her to the cast and crew of the Him And Me show he's starring in with new Strictly judge, Anton Du Beke.

Happy couple: Maura and Giovanni first went public with their relationship at Sapphires, Blackpool's Premier Drag Cabaret Show Bar at the beginning of July

A source told MailOnline: 'Gio and Maura are very much a couple. Everyone know he's played the field in the past but he is serious about Maura.

'He's smitten with her, they've become close really quickly and are spending a lot of time together in Blackpool.

'She's become pals with all of the cast and crew of Him and Me too and they think she's great. Maura has also met Anton and they got on brilliantly.'

Romance? The Italian hunk was linked to Katie when they were seen at an awards party five years ago however Katie denied the dating rumours

The dancer dated Corrie actress, Georgia May Foote, 30, when he partnered her on Strictly in 2015.

He also dated Pussycat Dolls singer Ashley Roberts when she was on Strictly in 2018.

The Strictly 2021 pairings won’t be unveiled until next month’s launch show. However the full celebrity line-up is now complete.

Ugo Monye, Tom Fletcher, AJ Odudu, Robert Webb, Judi Love, Adam Peaty, Matilda 'Tilly' Ramsay, Greg Wise, Nina Wadia, Sara Davies, Rhys Stephenson, Rose Ayling-Ellis, John Whaite and Dan Walker will all be trying to win the Glitterball trophy.

'People say s*** about me that doesn’t even make sense,' the 33-year-old singer said in the candid social media clip, in which she used a tissue to wipe away her tears. 'It’s fatphobic, it’s racist and it’s hurtful - if you don’t like my music cool, if you don’t like Rumors the song, cool but a lot of people don’t like me because of the way I look.'

The Grammy Award-winning performer said she feels the loving energy she tries to put out isn't reciprocated.

The latest: Lizzo, 33, on Sunday took to Instagram Live to express her anguish over 'fat-shaming and racist' reactions in response to Rumors, her collaboration with Cardi B

'I’m putting so much loving energy into the world ... and sometimes I feel like the world don't love me back,' said the recording artist, whose real name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson. 'It doesn’t matter how much positive energy you put into the world, you’re still going to have people that have something mean to say about you.'

The Truth Hurts artist said that 'for the most part,' the negativity doesn’t hurt her feelings, but her patience and tolerance is lessened amid a grueling schedule of writing, performing and promoting, but the reaction to Rumors has been an exception.

'I’m more sensitive and it gets to me ... I feel so down, I'm hurt so hard,' the Detroit native said, adding that she's been working overtime on a daily basis making and promoting her music, even following a root canal procedure.'

In the ancient Greek-themed video, which premiered Friday, Lizzo and Cardi B reunited since their last work on the 2019 hit film Hustlers.

Cardi B took to her defense in a tweet, imparting her own wisdom on the topic of how to mentally deal with the haters.

'When you stand up for yourself they claim [you're] problematic & sensitive,' she said. 'When you don’t they tear you apart until you crying like this. Whether you skinny, big, plastic, they going to always try to put their insecurities on you. Remember these are nerds looking at the popular table.'

Cardi B also shared screen grabs documenting the early success of Rumors while adding that 'body shaming and callin her mammy is mean & racist as f***.

Cardi B took to Twitter to defend her musical peer against the torrent of hateful tweets

'Rumors is doing great,' she said. 'Stop trying to say the song is flopping to dismiss a woman emotions on bullying or acting like they need sympathy. The song is top 10 on all platforms.'

Jameela Jamil also chimed in, expressing her disgust over the nasty social media communications Lizzo has had to contend with in the wake of the song's release.

'Lizzo makes a song about people spending energy trying to bring women down,' Jamil said. 'Twitter erupts in abuse about her talent and mostly her appearance, and then she cries on IG live while addressing how damaging this culture is, and she gets made fun of for crying. This is so f****d up.

Chloe credited Lizzo for inspiring her with her candor

She continued: 'This app has spawned, encouraged and celebrated the most depraved, dehumanized and depressing side of human beings. It’s not FUNNY that you’re hurting some innocent cheerful musician’s mental health. It’s not going to take back the pain of whatever your school bullies did to you.

'When you pile onto and Enjoy the pain of a Black woman who literally only tries to uplift other people, while NOT spending your time piling onto and going after actual abusers and predators… it doesn’t make you cool. It highlights what a useless, irrelevant, vicious pig you are.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nearly 60 per cent of Britons have tried to find out how much people they know spent on their latest property purchase, new figures have revealed.

While few believe it is acceptable to ask someone what they paid for a home outright, the vast majority have adopted under-the-radar tactics to discover what family, friends, 'frenemies', neighbours, colleagues and even potential partners paid for their homes.

Twenty-four per cent of people admitted they had even called time on a relationship after finding out the value of their partner's home, according to Zoopla.

Clued up: Nearly 60 per cent of Britons have tried to find out how much people they know spent on their latest property purchase, according to Zoopla

People also use 'super-snooping' tactics, which include searching for sale records online, to see how much a home they want to buy was last sold for, or to track what has happened to the price tag of a property they used to live in.

'People always want to know what others have paid for a property', Camilla Dell, managing partner at Black Brick Property Solutions, told This is Money.

While the majority of people are activity snooping, 65 per cent said they would never admit to the owner that they had researched their property's sold price.

Neighbours, friends and family member's homes are the most likely targets for super-snoopers, but 11 per cent said they had also looked up what a colleague paid for a property.

Three in ten said they were able to make assumptions about their colleagues' pay packets after finding out how much they were able to fork out for their home.

How to track house prices HM Land Registry has an online tool which enables people to look up sold prices for properties across England and Wales. Separate tools apply for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Land Registry sold data is used by websites including Rightmove, Zoopla and others to show how much properties went for. At the height of the pandemic last year, there was a lull in publishing up-to-date sold price data for house prices, with the Land Registry claiming it was focused on providing its 'core' services instead. But sold price data is now readily available, and generally seems up-to-date again. There are a few other options for keeping abreast of house prices near where you live. Halifax and Nationwide both publish their own indices each month. Both of these data sets are based on significantly fewer transactions than the Office for National Statistics' – around 15,000 a month – and as they are based on their own mortgage lending they exclude cash purchases, making them less comprehensive. They are, however, more up-to-date than the Land Registry, where a sale can take weeks or months to be registered in the system. Every three months, Nationwide also puts out more detailed regional house price reports. There's also LSL Acadata, which is based on Land Registry data, but uses its own internal models to give more up to date predictions and forecasts.

One in ten people said they had even checked out the value of the home of a prospective, current or former partner.

Nearly a third said they continued to date someone they would have otherwise ditched after viewing the price tag of their home online. For people aged between 35 to 44, this figure rose to 46 per cent.

Around half of people said seeing a partner's property value 'encouraged' them to keep dating someone, rising to 63 per cent for men.

But a quarter of people said they had called time on a relationship after viewing the value of their partner's home.

The emotions stirred by seeing how much someone has paid for a home can be complicated, and 11 per cent admitted they felt jealous after seeing the figures involved.

However, 10 per cent said they respected the person more after seeing their property's value, while 9 per cent said they felt they liked the person more than before.

Tom Parker, consumer spokesperson for Zoopla. said: 'Buttoned up Brits love talking about house prices - but for most, asking someone straight up what they paid for their home is still considered a taboo.

'But how much a house sold for is publicly available information and is easy to source online.

'Whether it's your boss, a friend or even a potential partner, it's clear we want to know more about the homes they live in and will often treat them differently as a result.'

Buying agents will often go to great lengths to help their clients find out what other people paid for a home they are interested in.

Camilla Dell added: 'As buying agents, before we submit an offer on a property we always do a comprehensive "buying report" for our clients.

'Within the report we highlight relevant comparable sales. It’s all about the price per square foot - the price paid divided by the internal square footage.

'This gives our clients a pretty good idea if the price they are paying is reasonable or not, and also aids us with our negotiations.

'We obtain data via Lonres - an industry-only database for agents, and the Land Registry.

'For off-plan sales, obtaining comparable sales data is a lot more difficult as sales will only appear on the Land Registry once they have completed which could be years away.'

Last month, data from the Office for National Statics revealed that average house prices across the country increased by 10 per cent in the year to May.

Some buyers fear they paid too much for their latest property, after savings from the stamp duty holiday were eaten up by soaring price tags.

The main stamp duty holiday applicable on homes up to £500,000 ended on 30 June.

Until 30 September the nil rate band will be £250,000. It will then return to the standard amount of £125,000 on 1 October.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Ever heard of the phrase 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush'?

At its most basic level, this is the 'endowment effect' and is based on the finding that people will often place greater value on things once they have established ownership – be that a tangible object, such as a painting, or something less tangible like a stock market investment.

It leads to a situation where people will demand more money to sell an item that they own than they, or other people, would be prepared to pay for it, writes Rob Smith, head of behavioural finance at Barclays Wealth.

Emotional biases may have an impact on your investments, particularly if you're holding onto loss-making assets in the hope they'll 'come good'

Experts believe it's down to human nature and our deep-rooted aversion to feeling a sense of loss.

For example, we feel loss when we give up something we own, but we do not have that same feeling when we choose not to purchase something.

We are keener to avoid losing the item than we are to acquire it, and so put a higher value on it.

To bring this to life, the most well-known study on the behaviour found that participants wanted $7.12 to sell a mug that they owned, which had no sentimental value, but would only pay $2.87 to buy the same mug when they didn't own it.

Closely related to the endowment effect is the 'disposition effect', where investors hold onto loss-making assets longer than those that make gains – in the hope that they will 'come good' eventually.

These emotional biases towards things we already own can have a real impact on investors, as it can lead them to value their existing investments higher than what they would be willing to pay if they did not already own them.

Signs you're a sufferer

Feeling an emotional connection to your investments, whether this is to the company itself or its past financial performance, will increase your chances of suffering from the endowment effect.

This doesn't always mean that feeling a connection to your investments is a bad thing, but it does mean you need to be conscious of how your feelings might be influencing your judgement.

For instance, if you don't actively compare your investments with other potential opportunities, you might be falling prey to these effects and be missing out financially.

A sure fire way to tell is to pretend you don't currently hold your investments, and ask yourself 'would I buy this at its current price if I didn't already own it'?

If the answer is no, then you are certainly suffering from these effects and should consider selling.

Practical ways to fight it

Rob Smith: Consider whether you'd buy an asset at its current price if you didn't already own it

There are a couple of ways that you can try to overcome your emotional biases and work out if you're attaching too much value to your investments – potentially losing out on good market opportunities:

1. Think about an investment very similar to the one you own, but that's not in your portfolio.

Try to establish what you would view as a reasonable price for the investment were you to buy it today.

If the value is less than that of your current investment, then you should think about selling.

2. Consider the opportunity cost, as in the money you could be losing out on, by holding your investment – if there are other options that provide better risk-adjusted returns, then you should be looking to sell.

A gain of 5 per cent in isolation may seem attractive, but if this is considered against an 8 per cent gain from another investment with similar risk, then it becomes easier to overcome the bias.

3. Take a look at your portfolio and work out whether you hold any emotional attachments to your investments, and why.

It could be that you've inherited them from a close family member, that you used to work for the company in your youth, or that they're a sustainable investment addressing issues that you care about.

Whilst these are all sound reasons, and very understandable, the reality is that any emotional attachment to your investments can harm your decision making ability – so try and limit your emotions where you can.

When it comes to investing, it's fine to be led by motivations other than just financial returns, particularly when it comes to ESG investing - but even these investments should be judged as dispassionately as possible and on their merits.

By understanding your emotions, you can try to manage them - giving yourself the best chance of creating a portfolio that is fully diversified and set-up to take advantage of market opportunities, whilst weathering any market storms.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The wealthy western world’s population is ageing and medicine is changing fast.

Biotechnology lies at the intersection of this growing need for healthcare and treatments that are tailored to patients, such as immunotherapy, rather than taking a traditional one size fits all approach.

Investors’ excitement for this brave new world saw many biotech fund and trusts deliver startling performance from 2012 to 2016 before the sector then suffered a fall, as the last US election brought worries to the fore.

Things have begun to look up again for biotech over the past year and we are joined on this Investing Show by Ailsa Craig, of International Biotechnology Trust, to find out more about this and the sector.

Ailsa explains what biotechnology is, about the firms operating within the sector, and what some of the companies that her trusts invests in do.

She discussed how International Biotechnology Trust, which dates back to 1994, invests, from unquoted companies to companies worth billions.

Ailsa says that it looks for highly innovative, high growth companies with pricing power, but explains how it also seeks to take some of the risk out of such a high stakes sector.

International Biotechnology Trust has beaten the market over five years, with a 74.9 per cent return, compared to 65.3 per cent for the biotech and healthcare sector. It is also unusual in paying a dividend, currently 4.4 per cent.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Investors in the UK were deeply pessimistic at the start of 2019, but it has turned out to be a decent year for returns… so far.

The UK stock market, as measured by the FTSE All-Share index, is up almost 9 per cent on the start of the year.

But while traditionally at this time of the year people would be talking about the prospects of a Santa Rally, this December it’s different as there is a general election taking place in the middle of the month.

What could that mean for the UK stock market? Will a big Conservative majority see the Footsie bounce, while a surprise Labour government would see it sink?

And is that perceived wisdom just anti-Labour bias?

Could a Labour victory and all the extra spending the party promises actually turn out to be good for the economy, put money in people’s pockets and boost ultimately boost the stock market?

On this episode of the Investing Show, Simon Lambert, of This is Money, and Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, discuss the UK election prospects for investors.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Flights to amber list countries are available from just £15 with seven night package holidays also selling for as little as £146, new research has revealed.

There has been a surge in demand for travel to foreign countries after the Government revealed double vaccinated travellers could fly to amber list countries without having to quarantine on their return.

But those looking at seemingly cheap trips will need to realise where they stand on having to also pay potentially hundreds of pounds for coronavirus tests for a family of four - and check they are fully insured.

Customers can travel to amber and green list destinations for as little as £15 this summer

Holidaymakers can now visit popular countries including Greece, Italy and Portugal this summer – although they are warned to check the rules in place at the destinations before visiting.

Demand for foreign travel has been so high that on 8 July, the day after the announcement was made, Skyscanner saw the most daily bookings made in over six months.

The holiday site found the most searched for destinations for this summer include Palma, Alicante, Malaga, Ibiza and Barcelona.

However, prices have remained low, thanks to the effect coronavirus has had on the industry. Holidaymakers' financial concerns include the price of testing and whether they will lose out if the rules change and trips cannot go ahead.

Martin Nolan, Skyscanner Traveller Rights Expert, said: 'With attentions at home now turning into plans for summer breaks, many are looking to international holidays as the easing of restrictions puts overseas breaks back on the agenda.

'Weekly bookings were up by 39 per cent last week compared to the previous week, with Spain taking the lion's share of bookings. Spanish destinations accounted for seven of the top ten most booked since the announcement was made.

'Many of the major providers have been vocal about their plans to keep prices low to win back travellers in a very competitive travel marketplace.'

Some of the cheapest flights available on Skyscanner include London to Turin for just £15 and London to Barcelona or Porto for only £16.

Other deals include London to Biarritz for £23 and London to Crete for £30.

Package holiday deals are also available from as little as £151, according to Travel Super Market.

Holidaymakers can book flights to Biarritz, a French city, for just £23 return from Skyscanner

Emma Coulthurst of Travel Super Market said: 'Package holidays tend not to see the immediate steep fluctuations in prices which flights do due to airline revenue management systems.

'Some holiday providers own their own airlines and can control prices - or the flight and accommodation prices have been secured by holiday providers in advance.

'Packages are nearly always better value than going DIY and they also give you better financial and legal protections.

'There are some low prices. There is a package deal for a family of four starting from £114 per person for seven nights in the Canaries which is beyond unheard of.

'However, it is a sign of what has happened to the holiday market this year as a result of Covid and the devastation which it has wrecked on holiday demand.'

This is Money, with the help of Travel Super Market, takes a look at the best package deals currently available for trips to both amber and green list destinations.

What are the new rules for amber list countries? As of 19 July, arrivals to England from amber list countries will no longer need to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated at least 14 days ago, or are on a formally-approved UK vaccine clinical trial. Passengers will need to provide proof of their vaccination status to carriers in advance of travel. The recommendation for people to not travel to amber countries will also be removed from 19 July but people should continue to check FCDO travel advice before booking travel. Holidaymakers will still needed to be tested pre-departure and are tested two days after returning. They cannot use NHS testing and will also still have to pay for the tests themselves which can range into the hundreds – or even thousands – of pounds. Children under the age of 18 will not have to isolate when returning to England whilst those aged 4 and under will continue to be exempt from any travel testing. Children aged 5 to 10 will only need to do a day 2 PCR test and 11 to 18 year olds will need to take both a pre-departure test and a day 2 PCR test – as is the case for arrivals from green list countries.

Don't forget restrictions for your destination

Whilst travellers can now take advantage of heading to amber list countries, there are still restrictions when arriving and what you will have to do depends on the destination.

Currently, for all locations in Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, all arrivals must present either a negative Covid-19 test, or proof of vaccination upon entry.

Before travel to Spain, all passengers travelling by air or sea must also complete and sign an online Health Control Form no more than 48 hours prior to travel declaring any known history of exposure to Covid-19 and giving contact details.

Meanwhile, for Greece and the Greek islands, travellers must fill in a Passenger Locator Form no later than 11:59pm at local time in Greece of the day before arriving in Greece.

Arrivals from the UK must also provide proof of a negative Covid-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before arrival into Greece, or proof of a negative Covid-19 rapid antigen test from an authorised laboratory, undertaken within the 48 hour period before the scheduled flight.

Travellers will often have to show proof of a negative test or their vaccination status for entry

Travellers can also show proof of two Covid-19 vaccinations completed at least 14 days before travel. Any of these will ensure you are exempt from the need to self-isolate on arrival to Greece.

Greece will also accept proof of recovery from Covid-19 for entry. While the NHS does not provide proof of recovery records, evidence of a positive Covid-19 PCR test result taken between 30 to 180 days of your travel dates can be used.

Meanwhile, for Italy, until 30 July, travellers who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days must present a negative molecular or antigen test taken in the 48 hours preceding entry into Italy and fill in a digital localisation form.

They must also self-isolate for five days, at the end of which they must take a rapid antigenic or molecular swab test for Covid-19 and test negative for release.

Everyone arriving in Italy must also call the Covid-19 helpline for the region they are travelling to within 48 hours, to inform them of your visit. Children under the age of 6 do not need to test or self-isolate.

For those travelling to mainland Portugal, including Madeira and the Azores, they must quarantine for 14 days, unless they can prove they are fully vaccinated.

All holidaymakers, apart from children under 12, must also show proof of a negative Covid-19 test.

The test can be a PCR test, taken within 72 hours of travel, or an Antigen test, such as a lateral flow test, taken within 48 hours of travel.

For those heading to Madeira or the Azores, there will be extra forms to complete.

However, in Madeira, you can show proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid, instead of a negative test. The NHS Covid Pass can be used as proof.

Meanwhile, in the Azores, you can show medical proof of recent recovery from Covid but will have to take more tests if staying longer than a week.

Currently the UK is on France's Amber list which means those who are not fully vaccinated will only be permitted to travel for essential reasons.

Those who are not fully vaccinated will need to present a completed International Travel Certificate to confirm their essential reason for travel.

All travellers will also have to complete a ‘sworn statement’ form certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight.

More importantly, this will confirm that those not vaccinated will self-isolate for seven days after arrival.

Those who are vaccinated do not need to isolate but will need to show proof of the jabs.

Meanwhile, everyone aged 11 years old or over will need evidence of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure or an antigen test within 48 hours of departure.

There will also be random antigen testing for unvaccinated arrivals.

These stipulations may change over time and anyone looking to head abroad is encouraged to regularly check the rules to ensure they can comply.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@In 2018, Laura Crawford took a huge gamble. She swapped long hours as a management consultant in the City to start a nappy brand.

Fed-up with toddler tantrums and a colicky baby, she launched Mama Bamboo as an alternative to damaging plastic nappies and a lack of eco alternatives.

Here, as part of our new B Corp Beat series - focusing the spotlight on 'green' British companies - we find out more…

Mama Bamboo uses FSC-certified Moso bamboo which is fully sustainable and naturally antibacterial

The Attenborough effect

Laura admits she gave little thought to the effects disposable nappies had on the environment when she had her first child.

'I had no idea what was in a nappy, I hadn't even considered it and just bought what was on the shelf. I accepted that nappy rash was part and parcel and there was no alternative.'

Like the plastic straws and single use plastic bags David Attenborough warned about in his 2017 documentary Blue Planet II, approximately 8million disposable nappies are thrown into landfill every single day in the UK and can take up to 500 years to biodegrade.

By the time Laura's son was due she had cottoned on to the effects of single use plastic and sought out alternatives like reusable cloth nappies.

'As soon as he was born he went into cloth nappies which were a nightmare. I was handling a new born that was too small for the nappies, he was colicky, and my daughter was only 2 years old,' she says.

'It was the last straw. I went to find eco disposables and, at the time, there was only one brand and I didn't get on with them - they were papery, stiff and leaked a lot.'

What is a B Corp? In our new B Corp Beat series, we are interviewing British businesses which meet these strict standards. They are described as businesses that are said to meet the 'highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.' One the website, it says: 'B Corp Certification doesn't just evaluate a product or service; it assesses the overall positive impact of the company that stands behind it. And increasingly that's what people care most about.' B Corp was started in 2006 and gives scores to companies in order for them to be verified. These five areas are: governance, workers, community, environment and customers.

Shortly afterwards, the idea for Mama Bamboo was born.

'It was during a conversation with a friend who was an expat living over in Singapore - she mentioned that in Asia they had been using bamboo to make nappies for quite a long time.

'I was surprised because I couldn't work out how bamboo used in flooring and for plates could possibly be used in a nappy.'

Bamboo has become a popular alternative because it grows quickly and, in the correct conditions, does not need any chemicals, fertiliser, pesticides or irrigation system.

Laura opted for FSC-certified Moso bamboo which is fully sustainable and naturally antibacterial.

In the spring season it can grow between 12 and 15 feet in just three weeks so it is not in short supply.

The bamboo is shipped from China meaning it is still contributing negatively to the environment and not a completely sustainable option.

Mama Bamboo is not the only one creating bamboo nappies: eco brand Cheeky Panda has developed its own range while Boots now produces nappies which use 40 per cent plant-based materials.

By comparison Mama Bamboo claims its nappies currently biodegrade more than 60 per cent in less than three months and can achieve 80 per cent within two years. At this time no nappy can offer 100 per cent.

Laura says that each year, it calculates its carbon footprint and replants enough bamboo to soak up the equivalent carbon within two years.

While Mama Bamboo's eco credentials may come out on top, the challenge for Laura is convincing customers her products are best. Her immediate plan is to raise investment to expand both the product range and Mama Bamboo's geographical reach.

Crowdfunding round

Mama Bamboo has slowly built itself up over three years, and because it is mainly an online subscription business, it has not been too hurt by the pandemic.

Customers can save up to 20 per cent by subscribing but the products are still considerably more expensive than plastic disposables. A carton of 35 nappies costs £7.40 while an 80 pack of Pampers costs just £10.

This clear disparity between the two may prove to be a barrier to mainstream uptake.

However, Laura says the company has grown from a turnover of £360,000 last year to being on target for £900,000 this year. As the business grows more, so too does the need for specific expertise at the helm.

Laura Crawford launched Mama Bamboo in 2018 after she could not find any disposable eco-friendly nappies

'Jennie, who runs the logistics and operations, is my university friend. I brought her in the early days to help me pack boxes and now she's worked her way up to the head of logistics,' Laura says.

'We've got to the point where we can see the gaps within the team and I can feel where my amateur working of marketing and sales is holding the business back now.'

As a result, Mama Bamboo has launched a crowdfunding round with ecobank Triodos, targeting £540,000 worth of investment.

The decision to opt for crowdfunding came after Laura was approached by the head of Triodos' crowdfunding who incidentally used Mama Bamboo's products.

'We're still a start-up. I would personally find it quite hard to ask a single angel investor for half a million pounds. Whereas I felt more comfortable spreading it out amongst a couple of hundred investors, managing the risk a little better.'

Laura's main priority is hiring a sales director to ramp up Mama Bamboo's international presence.

The company was forced to abandon selling in the EU through Amazon amid the Brexit uncertainty.

'We're at the stage where we're ready to get back in there. Instead of shipping products to Amazon FBA UK, who handled logistics, I'm looking to have EU distributors that we can ship directly to from China with tailored branding.'

Laura is nothing but ambitious. She also wants to expand the product line into homeware, which would include bathrobes and towels, as well as a range of baby care products and a feminine care range.

B Corp certification

Mama Bamboo has carved out its niche. It says it was the first UK company to sell nappies made from sustainably grown bamboo and the only firm in the world whose nappies include fully compostable linings and packaging.

Its eco credentials don't just stop with its products.

Mama Bamboo launched the #nappyrevolution campaign calling on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to change the way councils handle nappy and wipe waste.

And in 2021/22 Mama Bamboo will partner with UCL to develop a sustainable circular economy model for councils to adopt curbside collection of industrial compost waste, including nappies and wipes.

This work prompted one of Laura's team to encourage Mama Bamboo to apply for a B Corp certification.

Prospective companies have to go through rigorous assessments and is awarded to organisation who achieve as core of at least 80 out of 200 against five areas of impact: Governance, Community, Workers, Environment and Customers.

It led to Mama Bamboo going through the painstaking process of switching banks after the organisation noted there were better and more ethical alternatives.

'We changed bank to Starling. I hadn't thought about the fact we were banking with someone who didn't particularly have an ethical background.'

Over the 11 months it took for Mama Bamboo to be certified as a B Corp, Laura learned more about the audits required, particularly for Chinese suppliers.

'We were doing it through an independent third party and [the certifiers] pushed us towards some standard international audits that not only will get a standard score but the companies themselves will be more incentivised to try and improve their score because they can use it in their own marketing.'

Mama Bamboo achieved certification in 2020, making it the only UK and European Nappy Company to join the ethical group of businesses.

She says: 'I love the ethos. it's not just about the product, it's about the business and the practices. And they fact you have to use your business for good not just for profit.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Homeowners in the UK will be offered £7,000 grants to help replace their gas boilers in a new £400million scrappage scheme.

Plans have been pulled together to improve the Clean Heat Grants scheme for relaunch in April next year.

Earlier reports about the future of the scheme suggested ministers were examining the idea of a £4,000 'clean heat grant' that would help pay for new green boilers from next April for two years.

However, The Times reports that the plans have had another overhaul with hopes of quadrupling the budget, with grants starting from £7,000 and extending the scheme to three years.

The Clean Heat Grants scheme is set to be relaunched in April next year and will see the government quadruple its budget, including grants starting from £7,000 to replace gas boilers. Pictured: Boris Johnson visits a wind farm in Aberdeenshire last week

The scheme will help pay for close to 60,000 heat pumps to be installed and will see a large-scale advertising push to replace gas boilers.

The government has set a target to install 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 - which cost £10,000 compared to £1,000 for a new gas boiler.

Heat pumps transfer a source of heat or warmth, such as the heat from soil in the garden, from one destination to another, such as a hot-water system in a home.

Compared to boilers, heat pumps use a small amount of electricity - often achieving a 200%-600% efficiency rate because the amount of heat produced is higher than the energy consumed.

The scheme is just one of several plans Boris Johnson has announced in recent weeks, including plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and hopes to scrap all gas boilers within four years.

He has committed to achieving ‘net zero’ carbon emissions by 2050 – a target that could cost £1.4trillion.

Families will shoulder much of this expense – up to £400 a year per household – through having to replace their gas boilers and switch to electric cars, among other things.

It comes after a new UN climate report painted a bleak picture of the future without immediate action.

If hydrogen is part of a zero-carbon future, it could have to be produced by electrolysis (as shown above), which sees electric currents passed through water. Another option is for the plants to capture the carbon emissions and pump them underground

A major UN climate report put huge pressure on Governments to take more action to cut emissions in the run up to international Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow in November.

Boris Johnson is reportedly hoping to announce the scheme ahead of the climate change conference.

The pledge has caused fury in Tory circles, with MPs warning that the additional costs will hit lower earners in the Conservative-voting Red Wall. It has also reportedly led to clashes between the Prime Minister and his Chancellor Rishi Sunak.

Kent MP Craig Mackinlay has launched a group to to push back at plans he argues could be could 'completely kill us off politically'.

He and others argue they will hit poorer voters in former 'Red Wall' areas who voted Conservative for the first time in 2019.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said last night ministers 'want to try and help people make that transition' when asked about the expense to consumers of scrapping gas boilers.

The UN's climate report, which has sparked much of the new climate change tackling schemes, focuses on the physical science of climate change, forms the first part of the IPCC's sixth assessment report, and is even clearer on the impact humans are having on the planet than the last such analysis in 2013.

It draws on more than 14,000 scientific papers to reach its conclusions and has found it is 'unequivocal' that human activity is warming the world.

Rapid and widespread changes to the land, atmosphere and oceans have occurred - from temperature increases to sea level rises - that are unprecedented for many centuries or even many thousands of years.

A new group is being set up by Kent MP Craig Mackinlay to push back at plans to outlaw sales of new petrol and diesel cars and replace gas boilers within the next 20 years. Chancellor Rishi Sunak (left) is said to be looking at ways to ease the pressure on poorer families of the transition.

The report makes clear that human-caused climate change, which has pushed up global temperatures by 1.1C, is driving weather and climate extremes in every region across the world.

There are already more frequent and intense heatwaves and heavy rainstorms in many places, including northern Europe, as well as droughts and cyclones.

How much will new green and anti-obesity projects cost Britons? Boris Johnson's green and anti-obesity projects could end up costing Britain's households more than £28,000 each over the coming decade if they are fully implemented, it emerged today. The Prime Minister is considering a range of eco-friendly policies during his tenure such as a ban on new fossil-fuelled cars including hybrids by 2033. £15,000 : Extra average cost of buying a new electric vehicle is £44,000 compared to £29,000 for a new medium-sized car

Humans are also very likely the main driver in the global retreat of glaciers, declines in Arctic sea ice, and rising sea levels.

Sea level rises are speeding up, with the oceans rising by 3.7mm (0.15 inches) a year in recent years, and are set to continue to rise this century whether emissions remain high or fall dramatically.

Changes to oceans, sea levels and melting permafrost and glaciers are irreversible for decades, centuries or even millennia as a result of past and future warming.

And cities are at particular risk as the climate warms, experiencing hotter temperatures in heatwaves and flash flooding from heavy rain.

The study also warns that unlikely events such ice sheet collapses, abrupt changes to ocean circulation - which drives weather patterns - and much higher warming cannot be ruled out.

But the report, which assesses the potential impact of a range of five future scenarios from very low emissions to very high pollution, highlights the impacts of the choices the world makes now.

Temperature rises have a good chance of remaining below 1.5C in the long term if carbon emissions are cut to net zero by 2050, followed by efforts to take more carbon dioxide out of the air than is put into the atmosphere, along with deep cuts to other greenhouse gases.

Cutting methane - produced by oil and gas drilling and agriculture, particularly livestock farming - could help curb rising temperatures, as well as improving air quality, the report said.

But scientists who worked on the report said current pledges of action on emissions put the world on a pathway that could lead to 2.7C of warming by the late 21st century - or higher if the pledges were not delivered on.

Sea levels would rise by around 28-55cm (11-22 inches) by 2100 in a very low emissions scenario, but by significantly more if emissions stayed high.

Every additional 0.5C temperature rise leads to clear increases in the intensity of heatwaves, rainstorms and flooding, and droughts in some regions.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@London Underground was a mini-pioneer back in 2005. It led the way with a new form of advertising, replacing static posters with digital panels that changed as passengers rode up and down the escalators.

The idea came from an American advertising agency, whose UK managing director at the time was Tim Bleakley.

Today, Bleakley runs Ocean Outdoor, which specialises in high quality digital advertising in busy places, such as the Printworks entertainment centre in Manchester, the Aston Expressway in Birmingham and London's Westfield shopping malls. It also operates in cities in Scandinavia and the Netherlands.

Good catch: Ocean Outdoor used 3D screens in Piccadilly Circus to promote the British and Irish Lions' recent tour

Digital displays have come a long way over the past 16 years. In streets, squares and retail hubs, Ocean broadcasts big events interlaced with ads, from Team GB's recent successes in Tokyo to the Queen's address to the nation during the first lockdown.

Panels strategically placed by roads that see heavy traffic can identify the make and model of individual cars and serve drivers with specific adverts, from insurance to rival vehicles.

A Royal Navy ad for the Submarine Service changes shape when people look at it for more than a few seconds, showing QR codes which take viewers straight to the Navy's recruitment website.

The company has also started producing 3D ads which appear to come out of the screen, such as a Vodafone British and Irish Lions campaign at Piccadilly Circus during the rugby team's recent test series against South Africa.

Ocean did its bit during the pandemic too, running ads for the NHS, offering cut-price deals for small businesses and supporting local heroes with creative displays.

Notwithstanding Bleakley's efforts through successive lockdowns, Ocean had a rough time last year.

With consumers stuck at home, outdoor advertising had limited appeal so 2020 turnover fell 38 per cent to £86million, the company recorded a pre-tax loss of £10.8million and the workforce was cut by 16 per cent to just over 230 staff.

However, Bleakley and his team used the year wisely, bedding down 2019 acquisitions, renegotiating contracts with landlords and investing in the future.

Demand is now recovering fast and brokers expect turnover of £107million this year, rising to £125million in 2022.

A small loss is likely again in 2021 but profits of £14.5million are forecast for next year, with further substantial gains pencilled in subsequently.

Big companies are increasingly drawn to digital advertising because they can do more with the medium and consumers tend to look at it for longer. Adverts can also be highly targeted around large events, from the UEFA Champions League to WWE wrestling matches.

Political events can be big draws too. Ahead of COP 26 – this autumn's environmental summit – Ocean held a sealed bid auction, recognising that demand for its panels would be strong at such a high-profile event.

The response has been enthusiastic, which should bolster revenues as the year draws to a close. Further ahead, Ocean is set on greater expansion, both organically and via acquisition.

New contracts are expected in places where the company already has a presence, there are plans to acquire more sites in the UK and Northern Europe and constant technological improvements should drive sales growth.

Acquisitions are also on the cards, both in existing locations and elsewhere.

Some large investors have questioned Ocean's exposure to shopping malls, given the popularity of e-commerce but Bleakley is sanguine, pointing out that, even if habits change, people will still always want to go out.

Ocean and its customers can swiftly adapt, placing screens where they will be seen.

Ocean is listed in London and its financial figures are produced in pounds and pence but the shares are priced in dollars, closing at $8.38 last week.

The anomaly arose because Ocean began as a public company by reversing into a shell firm backed by US investors. Over time, the stock should start to trade in sterling. Until then, investors can trade shares as easily as if they were quoted in our home currency.

Midas verdict: Digital advertising is one of the fastest-growing areas of the advertising sector and Ocean Outdoor is a leader in the field. Bleakley has years of experience, he is ambitious for the business and prospects are bright. At $8.38, the shares are a buy.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@The last time flooring group James Halstead failed to raise its dividend was when Harold Wilson was Prime Minister. That was in the mid-1970s, some 45 years ago.

The board juggled payments last year in response to the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, but was ultimately able to raise the dividend to a new record of 14.25p, marking almost half a century of unbroken growth.

The decision reflects Halstead's culture as a family-style business that combines financial conservatism and product innovation.

Founded in 1915, the business is still run by a scion of the original family, Mark Halstead, and still operates out of Greater Manchester.

Set in stone: The last time flooring group James Halstead failed to raise its dividend was when Harold Wilson (pictured) was Prime Minister

Today Halstead's floors are sold to customers right across the globe, all the way from Scott Base in Antarctica to Svalbard Hotells in northern Norway.

The company invented vinyl sheet flooring, known as Polyflor, in the 1940s and this remains the cornerstone of its success, used in schools, stations, offices, shops and homes in 180 countries worldwide.

Hospitals are major customers too. About a quarter of Halstead's revenue comes from the healthcare sector and virtually every NHS trust uses its flooring, as do hundreds of Covid-care and vaccination facilities worldwide.

A focus on healthcare helped Halstead to withstand the worst effects of the pandemic, while its ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances allowed the firm to gain market share from larger rivals.

In a trading update earlier this month, Halstead said he expected record results for the year to June 30, 2021, with analysts looking for a 7 per cent increase in sales to £255million and an 11 per cent rise in profits to £49million.

Further growth should be forthcoming this year and beyond. The group has been making strong gains in America, with medical facilities particularly attracted to the firm's hard-wearing and well-priced vinyl flooring.

Other international markets are in Halstead's sights, too. Overseas expansion was curtailed during the pandemic, but is gradually regaining momentum and should deliver results as travel becomes less challenging.

Closer to home, Halstead's luxury vinyl tiles, which look like wood or stone, are increasingly popular among homeowners, not just in kitchens and bathrooms but also in home offices and gyms.

Like most manufacturers, the group has been hit by a shortage of raw materials, as well as higher shipping costs and absenteeism among employees exposed to the coronavirus.

While these may create some short-term issues, the firm's long-term prospects remain robust.

Midas verdict: Midas recommended James Halstead shares in November 2018 at £3.72. They have risen 55 per cent since then to £5.50 and should continue to gain ground. A proud British business with a global reputation, Halstead has repaid shareholders handsomely. A strong, long-term hold.

The outing comes a week after she appeared to be resurrecting her part as 'Charlotte Big Jugs' in The Inbetweeners.

Reprising her role 13 years on, Emily dressed as a schoolgirl, filming what appears to be a skit for ITV2's The Emily Atack Sketch Show.

In a clip shared to Instagram while on a break, she joked that she looked like she was 45-years-old in the white shirt and striped tie.

Her blonde locks in pigtails, Emily then used a device to inflate her bust - truly bringing her Inbetweeners character back to life.

She found it hilarious, giggling with those around her at the gag.

'Charlotte Big Jugs having a break down 13 years on!' she joked in the caption.

At the time, Nikki explained to MailOnline that she is 'balancing sadness with happiness' after finding out she and Alex had lost one twin at her seven-and-a-half-week scan at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, in London, on December 2.

She said: 'I haven't planned on ever having twins - who does? But once I was pregnant with two babies I wanted them both so much.

'I had started planning to move to a new house in the countryside and visualised and dreamed of two babies growing up together.

'I felt like all this hard work had paid off and I had two amazing babies at the end of a very dark sad tunnel.'

Letting loose: Orlando Bloom, 44, stripped down to the nude for an invigorating swim in nature on Sunday, before showing off his pert backside for his Instagram followers

Orlando was nude at least from the waist up in a photo and an accompanying video he posted of himself taking a swim in what was either a lake or a gentle river.

In the short clip, he sent water flying as he finished up a backstroke, before standing up in the shallow water and swiping his hair back.

'Ah!' he exhaled with delight. 'So amazing!'

It wasn't clear if the Lord Of The Rings star was wearing swim trunks or in the buff, but he stripped down for a follow-up photo.

Orlando had his bare bottom covered with a playful peach emoji as he grinned and flashed a thumbs up.

It appeared to be a campground, and there were people off in the distance on the other bank, but he had some clothing draped over his nether regions so as not to flash them.

He let the photos and video do all the talking and simply captioned the post with water droplets emojis.

The post was a hit with fans, who left plenty of cheeky comments of their own.

His fellow actor Josh Brolin commented with multiple rock on emojis, while makeup artist Michael Anthony joked, 'Who knew he had the BACK STROKE toooooo!!!'

Helena Christensen joked, 'That family on the other side,' and added a staring emoji, while Roma Downey just wrote that it was 'peachy.'

Orlando was likely referencing his infamous and oft-mocked nude paddleboarding photos, taken in 2016 while he was on an Italian vacation with his then-girlfriend Katy Perry.

He was seen totally unclothed as he kneeled and paddled, while Katy was fully clothed and sat a the front of the board, looking somewhat embarrassed.

In July of last year, she opened up to Howard Stern about the risqué photos and admitted that her beau tried to get her to strip down with him.

After Howard asked if she refused to go nude because there were photographers around, she replied, 'I mean, I would have never, like, set him up if I had a real thought,' she said, via Vanity Fair.

'But in the back of my mind...I am Jim Carrey in The Truman Show a little bit, so I thought maybe there would be a chance. I would say I'm a little bit more of the pragmatic in the partnership.'

Old times: Orlando was likely referencing his infamous and oft-mocked nude paddleboarding photos, taken in 2016 while he was on an Italian vacation with his then-girlfriend Katy Perry; seen together on July 31 in Capri, Italy

Although her instincts turned out to be correct, she didn't think it was particularly nude that her love wanted to let it all free.

'Well it was Europe. Honestly, we had had a pretty chill time for a week and everywhere we looked it was like everybody was naked. It was Europe, it was Italy, and I think he wanted to fit in with the locals and it was the end of the trip,' she continued.

She also joke that she'd been unimpressed the day before when Orlando had been bragging about how popular his franchises Lord Of The Rings and Pirates Of The Caribbean franchises were on Twitter.

'I was like, eye roll, eye roll, eye roll,' she said, 'and then all of the sudden, he is number one trending on Twitter and I was like, 'How?! How?''

Seeing the sights: Orlando didn't specify where he was when he took his most recent nude photos, but he last updated his fans a week ago as he and Katy were on a gorgeous tour of Italy

The couple were originally seen earlier this month in St. Tropez, in the south of France, but decided to hit up Paris after the news broke last Tuesday that Cuomo was resigning from his position as governor, effective August 24.

Just a few hours earlier, Page Six reported, Lee, the former chef and author who broke up with Cuomo in 2019, and Youcef were seen stopping by a French church in the French Riviera.

Lee and Cuomo never got engaged during their 14 years together. The relationship is said to have ended when Cuomo reportedly cheated on her. The former Food Network star was previously married to former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz from 2001 to 2005.

Youcef, meanwhile, is a devoted father of five-year-old twins. He separated from his wife, California-based realtor Apryl Stephenson in 2019 and they filed for divorce in January 2020.

A friend told Page Six they were drawn together because they are both 'grounded in spirituality,' with another saying, 'We're just happy for her. We want Sandra to be happy, she deserves it.'

And Lee, a former QVC star who later hosted her own Food Network show, does appear to be happy, telling People, 'I'm having the best summer of my life.'

Sources told the Post that friends have been rooting for them since they met in the spring, shortly after Lee moved to Malibu following her 2019 break-up with Cuomo.

'Ben is a serious and accomplished nonprofit Interfaith leader providing the call to prayer heard all around the world,' a source familiar with the couple told Page Six.

Lee had dated Andrew Cuomo for 14 years until she broke up with him in 2019

People close to Lee said she struggled to get her life back over the past two years in the wake of her split with Cuomo, with one friend telling Page Six: 'It's very hard for Sandra to move on - she's not done licking her wounds.

'She's just trying to do the best she can to keep her head above water,' the friend said, noting that Cuomo's sexual harassment scandal 'has all been tremendously horrible and painful for her to read about.'

'Her heart was absolutely shattered,' the friend said, even though it had been 'an open secret' that Cuomo was cheating on her during their time together.

'When she split with Cuomo, she has never even spoken out about her time with him, she's always kept her mouth shut,' the unnamed friend said. 'She's just trying to find some kind of solace and happiness.'

'This is the first joy Sandra has had in years,' another unnamed friend said, 'but it's really not accurate to say she's moved on.

'She's spent the past two years in anguish since her split from Andrew. She had to move across the country to get her life back together again.'

Lee moved to Malibu, California following the 2019 break-up, where she bought a $3.4million beach house.

She sold her Mt. Kisko, New York home - named 'Lily Pond' - for $1.85 million last October.

The star was famously seen loading a U-Haul truck with her possessions before beginning the mammoth journey to her new home on the other side of the US.

Last Tuesday, Cuomo announced he was resigning as governor amid an attorney general's report showing that he had sexually harassed 11 women while in office

He has continued to deny the sexual harassment allegations. Pictured last week on August 10

Cuomo, meanwhile, gave his two-weeks notice on August 10, just weeks after Attorney General Letitia James released a scathing report concluding that he sexually harassed 11 women while in office.

He had repeatedly denied those claims, even as he announced his resignation, saying: 'Part of New York tough is being New York smart. New York smart tells us that this situation and moment are not about the facts. It's not about the truth. It's not about thoughtful analysis. It's about how do we make the system better.'

Her stunning pictures come as Little Mix made chart history as they became the first girl group to score 100 collective weeks in the Top 10 Official Singles Chart three weeks ago.

The pop group, made up of Perrie, 28,Jade Thirlwall, 28, and Leigh-Anne, hit the landmark with their latest single Heartbreak Anthem in collaboration with Galantis and David Guetta.

And even the iconic British girl power group Spice Girls couldn't hit the record as they only managed 50 weeks in the top 10 singles chart.

Little Mix have landed 18 UK top 10 singles to date, including five number ones - with Sweet Melody topping the charts most recently in January this year.

The landmark comes after it was reported that the show that launched their career, the X factor, had been axed on Wednesday evening.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Home and Away star Lincoln Lewis has shared a photo of a family birthday party that noticeably doesn't include his NRL legend father, Wally.

The telling post over the weekend was to celebrate the fourth birthday of his nephew William, the son of Lincoln's brother Mitch.

'Happy 4th birthday to my little champion of a nephew, William,' Lewis posted, in a photo that also includes his mother Jacqui, sister Jamie-Lee, brother Mitch, and his wife Sarah with their four children.

Queensland rugby league great Wally Lewis is not seen in the picture.

In a shock to fans of the high-profile couple, Lewis quietly split from Jacqui after 36 years of marriage last year, and started a relationship with Townsville mum and writer Lynda Adams.

Lewis senior has not publicly discussed the marriage breakup, but in a statement earlier this year acknowledged the 'pain and upset' the end of the relationship caused the family.

'I want to acknowledge the pain and upset my family has gone through since Jacqui and I separated last year,' he said.

'I hope over time we can rebuild our ties and move on with life.

'I will confirm I am now in another relationship and only ask for the media to respect our privacy.'

Former Home and Away star Lincoln spoke about his parents' high-profile split during an appearance on The Anj, Rob & Robbo Show in May.

'It's been hard on everyone obviously, and anyone who goes through stuff... it's obviously going to be hard,' Lincoln told the show's Robert McKnight.

'You're going through things in the public eye and that comes with the territory.'

Asked to comment on how his mother Jacqui was coping with the split, Lincoln said she's 'surrounded by good people who love and care about her'.

In February, the league great was seen at son Mitchell's house to celebrate the sixth birthday of nephew Luke.

The appearance helped dispel stories Lewis was no longer on speaking terms with his three children as a result of his break-up with Jacqui.

Lincoln Lewis is known to be especially close to his mother, who encouraged his pursuit of an acting career.

'He has always been open about that with people close to him,' a friend of Lewis told News Limited at the time of the marriage split.

'He has been known to say that he was raised by his mother.'

At the time the breakup became public, Lewis also took to Instagram to share his feelings.

Wally Lewis became one of the most acclaimed players in rugby league after a stellar playing career in the Queensland Rugby League, the Australian Rugby League and eventually as captain of Queensland's State of Origin team.

After retiring in 1992, he made a successful transition into the media as a commentator and nightly sports newsreader with Channel Nine. He was named a rugby league Immortal in 1999.

Her latest shots may have been taken by her new boyfriend Marc Kalman, who she has been nearly inseparable from since going public with their relationship last month.

Kalman was recently featured on Hadid's Instagram page, which boasts 44.8million followers.

Kalman was included in last week's photo dump from his and Bella's 'Day off in paradise' together, which was shot back in February.

The snap showed Bella planting a kiss on Marc's cheek, while other showed the model prancing around a tropical destination in various bikinis.

Her newest photos confirm that her romance with Marc has been going on for months.

The two were only romantically connected in July, when she shared a photo of them embracing in a since-deleted post, but a source shared with Page Six that the lovebirds had been together since the summer of 2020, though they 'hid it well.'

Their scheme to hide the relationship reportedly involved having Marc drive her car, but when they arrived at their destination he would let her out but would stay in the car and park it elsewhere, so as to be less conspicuous.

At the time that she went Instagram official with her Marc, who's an art director, her older sister Gigi Hadid left a smiley face emoji in the comments section.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Jackie 'O' Henderson has revealed her incredible new figure after losing a whopping 10kg in just a few months.

The KIIS FM radio host, 46, embarked on her weight loss journey in June after signing with WW (previously known as Weight Watchers) as a celebrity ambassador.

Now, having finally hit her goal weight, Jackie says she's feeling better than ever.

Brand-new me! Jackie 'O' Henderson, 46, has debuted her her trim new figure after shedding 10kg with WW (previously known as Weight Watchers)

'I feel great. I've got so much more energy and I don't walk past the mirror anymore and think, "My God, how did I get to this point?"' she told Woman's Day on Monday.

'I can wear what I want, and I finally feel like my old self again.'

Jackie signed up to WW after noticing her weight was spiralling out of control due to her busy schedule, irregular sleeping patterns and poor food choices.

Since signing up to WW, Jackie has been following a strict, yet nutritionally balanced, meal plan.

Describing her day on a plate, Jackie told Woman's Day she prefers to eat savoury food for breakfast, such as chicken or vegetable soup.

For lunch, she'll have a turkey burger or Cruskits with ham, cottage cheese and tomato, while dinner typically consists of fish and vegetables or poached chicken.

For snacks, the mother of one has swapped unhealthy options for nuts and yoghurt.

Discussing her weight loss on Monday's Kyle and Jackie O Show, Jackie said she 'never exercised once' during her 10kg slim-down.

Weight Watchers does offer an extensive range of exercise plans for clients, but it seems Jackie chose to avoid that part of the program.

Jackie, a notorious yo-yo dieter, has struggled with her weight for years.

Last May, she admitted she was 'embarrassed' about the weight she'd gained during lockdown and was desperate to lose the kilos before starring on The Masked Singer.

Embarrassed: She even revealed she was so self-conscious she would no longer let her daughter 10-year-old daughter, Kitty (left), see her naked

Jackie even revealed she was so self-conscious she would no longer let her 10-year-old daughter, Kitty, see her naked.

'Over the weekend I was in my bathroom and the door was closed. I took off my clothes because I was going to get in the bath,' she explained at the time.

'Kitty went to walk through into the bathroom and I screamed, 'Don't come in!' And she said, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm naked."

'Kitty said, "You're my mum. I see you naked all the time." And I said, "I know, but I just don't want you seeing me naked right now." Because I'm just so embarrassed about how much weight I've put on.'

Three months later, Jackie revealed she'd begged The Masked Singer's producers to remove 'unflattering' footage of her looking bloated after gaining 5kg overnight.

She said she'd experienced water retention and bloating after eating 80 seaweed snacks backstage the previous night.

'I didn't want to leave the house': In June, Jackie spoke about how her weight gain had affected her life, after she stacked on the kilos during Covid and became the 'biggest I have ever been'

Unfortunately, it was too late for a costume change, so Jackie had to squeeze into her dress and felt uncomfortable throughout the taping.

In June, Jackie spoke about how her weight gain had affected her life, after she stacked on the kilos during Covid and became the 'biggest I have ever been' .

'I stopped wanting to leave the house and was avoiding social outings because I just didn't feel well, motivated or confident anymore,' Jackie said on air, adding that she would spend up to $300 per week on Uber Eats.

Woman on a mission: 'I joined WW so that I can feel healthier, be more active, feel good about myself, and fit into my old clothes again,' Jackie said in June

She went on to explain how her busy lifestyle and early-morning starts affected her sleeping pattern and energy levels.

Before she knew it, she'd slipped into unhealthy eating habits.

'It can be a challenge to set a good standard for the day when you're up at 4:30am and running out the door – your whole day and eating schedule can be a little bit out of whack from there,' she said.

'I was never cooking for myself, Uber Eats was my best friend. It was expensive and a really unhealthy habit, which made me feel so bad about myself.'

'I joined WW so that I can feel healthier, be more active, feel good about myself, and fit into my old clothes again,' she continued, adding: 'It's also important to me that I set a good example for my daughter [Kitty] about a healthy lifestyle and approach to eating.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@‘We want an income not just for today, but a growing income into the future,’ says Evenlode Global Income’s Ben Peters.

Tapping into dividends that can deliver that is something that holds the key to a good total return for investors over the long term, the fund manager says, and hunting for those dividends around the world provides a much wider choice.

Ben has been co-manager of Evenlode Income for the past five years and that UK-focussed fund has proved a hit with investors, returning 58.8 per cent over five years compared to the average UK All Companies fund’s 18.4 per cent.

A global income fund seemed the logical next step and despite a tough year Evenlode Global Income returned 1.8 per cent in 2018, compared to minus 3 per cent for its benchmark index and minus 5.9 per cent for the average fund in the sector.

So how do you find the best dividend-paying companies – and how important is income now versus the potential for growing payouts in the future?

Ben and fellow manager and analyst Chris Elliott join us on the Investing Show to outline their thoughts on hunting for solid, reliable and growing dividends and explain why consumer staples, healthcare, and the media sector can help deliver those – hence the plethora of household names in the portfolio.

Not so much of interest are firms involved in capital intensive businesses, or who can’t set their prices so easily, says Ben, and will struggle to grow their dividends.

‘We want companies that can grow, but with a limited need for lots of capital to drive that growth’, says Ben. ‘And if we can find businesses that can do that, then they invest in themselves appropriately, to develop their products, develop their services, deliver more value to their customers, which is very important, then there is some cash left over and that can come back to investors in the form of a dividend.’

Will a Brexit deal UK shares to bounce?

Investors have been shying away from UK shares due to worries over how Brexit will happen.

It has even been called uninvestable in some quarters - not because of Brexit but because of the way we are exiting and the threat of a socialist Jeremy Corbyn government.

But where there is fear, lies potential value. Richard Hunter discusses whether a deal - or some certainty - could see the stock market bounce.




@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Halifax has launched the latest offensive in the mortgage price war, and is now offering a home loan with a record ultra-low rate of 0.9 per cent.

The bank, which is part of the UK's largest mortgage lender Lloyds Banking Group, has also brought out several other deals aimed at home movers with plenty of equity.

Borrowers with 40 per cent deposits can now get a two-year fixed rate at 0.9 per cent interest with a £1,499 fee, or at 0.91 per cent interest with a £999 fee.

How low can they go? Mortgage rates are dropping, especially for equity-rich remortgagors

Those looking for a longer fix can lock in for five years at a rate of 0.98 per cent with a £1,499 fee, or 1 per cent with a £999 fee.

For borrowers seeking the lowest possible rate, these are the lowest currently on the market – though they could possibly save money overall by opting for a higher rate with a lower upfront fee, as we explain below.

The deals are for remortgage only, whereas some other lenders are offering sub-1 per cent rates for those buying new homes, too.

However, one advantage of the Halifax deals is that they have much lower minimum borrowing requirements than other low-rate mortgages currently on the market.

All of Halifax's new rates are available on mortgage amounts between £25,000 and £1million, whereas competitor Nationwide, for example, is only offering its 0.91 per cent rate, which also comes with a £1,499 fee, to those borrowing at least £275,000.

The Halifax rates are available through selected brokers only from today.

Mortgage rates have been driven to record lows thanks to huge demand to move home in the wake of the pandemic, combined with banks having large cash reserves due to an uptick in personal savings, and the fact they can borrow cheaply with the Bank of England base rate sitting at 0.1 per cent.

Are they the best deal?

If a homeowner's priority is to pay the lowest possible interest rate, then these Halifax deals will probably fit the bill.

The 0.9 per cent and 0.98 per cent deals are the lowest two and five-year rates currently on the market.

They are followed closely by Nationwide's two-year fix at 0.91 per cent, which is again only available to those with deposits of at least 40 per cent, is exclusive to those borrowing at least £275,000 and attracts a £1,298 fee.

However, the Nationwide deal can work out cheaper when fees are considered.

A homeowner remortgaging a £500,000 home with a £300,000 mortgage would pay £28,309 over the two years with Halifax, while with Nationwide that figure would be £28,140.

The same borrower taking out the same mortgage on Barclays' 0.92 per cent rate with a £1,048 fee would pay £27,923.

Depending on the value of their home and the amount of their mortgage, homeowners might save even more money by paying a substantially higher rate with no fee.

For example, a remortgagor taking out the new 0.9 per cent Halifax deal with a £1,499 fee, on a £400,000 home with a mortgage of £220,000 would pay a total of £21,159 over the two-year deal period.

The same borrower taking a 1.14 per cent fee-free deal with either NatWest or HSBC would pay £20,236 over the same period, saving them more than £900.

Compare rates and fees and find the best deal for you using This is Money's calculator

Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: 'Halifax is the latest lender to engage in the mortgage rate war.

'Those with significant equity in their homes will qualify for the best rates, although lenders are cutting pricing across loan-to-value bands so even those with more modest levels of equity or deposits are benefiting.

'The low minimum mortgage size on the Halifax products - £25,000 - means those remortgaging even relatively modest mortgages can take advantage of these low rates.

'Other lenders could well follow suit as banks, awash with cash, compete for business. Borrowers are the winners although of course they must work out the total cost of any deal - rate plus fees - when comparing products.'

What about those with lower deposits?

While the best deals are reserved for the most equity-rich homeowners, rates are now trending downwards for those with less substantial deposits, after a turbulent year in 2020 when rates went both up and down as the property market closed and reopened.

For the first time in a year, both the average two-year and five-year fixed rate fell in July, according to finance experts Moneyfacts.

Analysis by Moneyfacts shows that, while the overall average mortgage rate has not hit the lows seen in the chaotic summer of 2020, it is once again trending donwards

Typical two-year fixes are now sitting at 2.55 per cent and 2.78 per cent respectively, having reduced by 0.04 per cent in the previous month.

They are still higher than their equivalent rates year-on-year, as July 2020 saw record lows of 1.99 per cent and 2.25 per cent – though those figures were skewed by lenders removing higher-interest, low-deposit mortgages from the market during the pandemic.

For example, the typical two-year fixed rate for someone with a 15 per cent deposit was 2.49 per cent in July 2019. It increased to 2.96 per cent by June 2021, but has now fallen to 2.82 per cent.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Yes, we all know it. Steve McQueen's car chase through the streets of San Francisco in the 1968 movie Bullitt epitomises to this day all that is great about the classic Mustang.

These adored macho muscle cars are famous for having roaring engines, big bulky frames and being effortlessly stylish. Mess with such an icon at your peril.

Yet those brave souls at the Ford headquarters in Dearborn, near Detroit, have done just that. For the latest Mustang Mach-E is pure electric, battery-powered, zero-emissions, and is a crossover SUV.

Top of the range: New all-electric Mustang Mach-E GT which starts from £41,330

The longest range is the 294hp rear-wheel drive model which will get you 379 miles and accelerate from rest to 62mph in seven seconds

The car is being built in Mexico and marks an American revolution. To many, they represent the American Dream as much as the Statue of Liberty. The car has been celebrated around the world, most recognisably in the song Mustang Sally - which was popularised by Wilson Pickett.

When America's first female Astronaut, Sally Ride, went into space aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1983, spectators wore T-shirts emblazoned with the words 'Ride, Sally Ride' from the song. And in September 2019, owners from across Europe met in Belgium to help Ford set a new world record for the most Mustangs in a single parade - 1,326.

I attended the global launch of the new all-electric Mustang Mach-E at the Los Angeles Motor show in November 2019 when British actor Idris Elba - who worked at Ford's UK plant at Dagenham - unveiled the new car to the world.

Across five models, the Mustang Mach-E range starts from £41,330 for a 269horsepower rear-wheel drive version with a range of 273 miles. The longest range is the 294hp rear-wheel drive model which will get you 379 miles and accelerate from rest to 62mph in seven seconds.

The fastest high-performance 'GT' version is on sale ahead of delivery at the end of the year, priced from £67,225 with acceleration from rest to 62mph in under four seconds.

Past to present in four models 1964 - The original The first Mustangs were priced from just $2,320 for the basic model The first Mustangs were a sensation, with 22,000 orders on launch day on April 17 1964. Some 419,000 cars sold that year. Priced from just $2,320 for the basic 101hp 6-cylinder 3-speed manual, they were available as a coupe, convertible or fastback, up to a powerful 271hp V8, with 21 colours. 1965 to Now - Shelby Today, the awesome new 760hp 5.2-litre Shelby GT500 costs from £52,526 Mustangs In a partnership with Ford, the late racer and sports-car specialist Carroll Shelby added high performance, track-inspired capability and style - with trademark two thick stripes - to the basic Mustang. Today, the awesome new 760hp 5.2-litre Shelby GT500 costs from £52,526 that accelerates from 0 to 62mph in 3.5 seconds. 1968 - Ford Mustang GT 390 Fastback Driven by Steve McQueen in Bullitt, this was one of two specially adapted for the film Driven by Steve McQueen in Bullitt, this was one of two specially adapted for the film. The other was damaged beyond repair. It was bought in 1974 and kept in storage in its original Highland Green condition by the Kiernan family in the U.S. for over 40 years. It sold at auction in 2020 for a record £2.62million. 2021- Mustang Mach 1 The Mustang Mach 1 is around £10k more expensive than the 5.0-litre V8 petrol GT Last gasp for the internal combustion engine - a 5.0-litre 460hp range-topping petrol V8 priced from £55,255 that sprints from 0- 62mph in 4.4 seconds. It's around £10k more expensive than the 450hp 5.0-litre V8 petrol GT.

Flying start

Born the same year as the mini-skirt and in the month the Beatles held the top five slots in the U.S. Billboard chart, the original Ford Mustang was launched at the World's Fair in New York on April 17, 1964. A prototype was built in 100 days after Ford executive Lee Iacocca commissioned research suggesting a gap in the market for a sporty two-door coupe with a long bonnet.

As a performance car for the masses, the Mustang proved an instant hit. Ford executives supplied a white convertible Mustang for the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, driven by would-be assassin Tilly Masterson (Tania Mallet) in a chase through the Swiss Alps against Sean Connery's Aston Martin DB5. Another Mustang appears in the 1965 follow-up Thunderball, and in Diamonds Are Forever in 1971.

In October 1965, Ford put a white convertible Mustang - 'the most successful new car in history' — on top of New York's Empire State Building, with eight staff dismantling the car, carrying it to the elevators and reassembling it on the 86th floor of the 1,742ft-tall building. Ford has repeated the trick twice. In 2014, it introduced a new Mustang on the 112th floor of Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, after having unveiled it on the Empire State Building earlier that year.

Glitz and glamour

But the car's status was sealed in Bullitt when the 1968 Ford Mustang GT 390 Fastback - driven by Steve McQueen playing cop Lt Frank Bullitt - took part in an epic 11-minute long chase with a Dodge Charger. For decades, that particularMustang was lost.

After filming it was sold to a Warner Brothers employee, and later to a New Jersey detective who in 1974 put an advert in Road & Track magazine. It was bought for $6,000 by Robert Kiernan of Madison, New Jersey, whose wife drove it until the clutch failed in 1980.

But Kiernan kept it until his death in 2014, leaving it and documented proof of provenance to his son, Sean. Kiernan rejected offers for the car, including one from McQueen in 1977. In 2018 it appeared at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit alongside a special edition 'Bullitt' Mustang driven on stage by McQueen's granddaughter Molly. In 2020 it sold at auction in Florida for a record $3.4million (£2.62million) - nearly 1,000 times more than the original $3,500 price tag.

A change of gears

Steve McQueen's car chase through the streets of San Francisco in the 1968 movie Bullitt epitomises to this day all that is great about the classic Mustang

Ford's global CEO Jim Farley with an original 1964 Mustang celebrates production of the 10 millionth Mustang with employees at the firm's headquarters at Detroit in August 2018

Claimed as 'the best-selling sports car', the 10 millionth Mustang was celebrated at Ford HQ in 2018 - alongside the first 1964 original off the line. But after six generations of burning gasoline, the seventh has gone electric.

The Mustang Mach-E should be looked on as a new car in its own right - designed to take on Elon Musk's Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y SUV. I've tested a couple of the new models and, like the originals, they're fun, quirky, well-thought-out with some clever 'wow' factors, and drive exceptionally well.

The only thing they lack is the intoxicating V8 roar or exhaust fumes. Ford's global CEO Jim Farley (a true 'petrolhead') loves both. He said: 'I get the same thrill seeing a Mustang in Detroit, London or Beijing that I felt when I bought my first car - a 1966 Mustang coupe I drove as a teenager. Mustang is the heart and soul of this company and a favourite around the world. It's is a smile-maker in any language.'

Ashley announced she was expecting her second child with husband Justin a little over a year after giving birth to their son Isaac last year.

The model recently admitted her control has 'gone out the window' during her pregnancy.

Speaking with People, Ashley said she has stopped trying to 'control' her body because she knows she will 'never feel the same' as she did before she was pregnant.

Bun in the oven! Graham announced she was expecting her second child with husband Justin a little over a year after giving birth to their son Isaac last year

She said: 'I think being in control when you're pregnant, it just gets thrown out the window.

'And I learned that the hard way when I tried to control everything when I was pregnant with Isaac and I told myself that I was going to bounce right back because I was breastfeeding and everybody told me, "Oh, if you breastfeed you're going to lose all the weight." And I had a few honest women tell me you will never feel the same. So they were just blunt with me and sure enough, I haven't felt the same.

'And then boom. I was like, "Well, I just got pregnant again so maybe I'll never feel the same and I don't even know what I felt like before I was pregnant with Isaac anyways."'

Forever and ever: Graham tied the knot with her husband Justin in 2010

Ashley also heaped praise on the 'mommy community' that she joined when she was pregnant with her first child, as she now has a place to go to for advice without being shamed.

'I think that the best thing I did was find a mommy community and when I'm pregnant, I find other pregnant people to just call and ask [questions] because this pregnancy is so different from the last and different symptoms, different feelings.

'And then when the kid gets here, then you have a whole other slew of questions because they don't come with a manual, so [I'm] all about the community. And I think that if I didn't have that, I would be so lost.'

Family Guy co-executive producer Gary Janetti, who created the 12-part animated series, appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen where he was asked by a fan whether Orlando Bloom - who voices Prince Harry - had discussed his role in the series with his friend and neighbour.

'I don't know if Harry has said anything to Orlando about it, but I know before the show premiered, he was aware that Orlando was doing it,' Janetti said. 'And he seemed to have a sense of humour about it.'

The show has sparked a backlash over its decision to mock George, eight, and his siblings Charlotte, five, and Louis, three, as well as its depiction of the late Duke of Edinburgh.

The controversial series - which focuses in a fictional version of Prince George as a child tyrant with expensive taste, a withering sense of humor and a dim view of his family - also shows Prince Harry as an inattentive father who has to work at a coffee shop to pay the bills after his TV projects fail.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are depicted living in an Los Angeles apartment after quitting royal life, with the pair eventually forced to take the bus to work to make ends meet once their money starts to run out.

Harry, who is voiced by his friend and Montecito neighbor Orlando Bloom, arrives at the coffee shop and asks how to make a cup of tea. In a separate episode he hands over a gold ring in a supermarket because he doesn't understand how to pay.

The Lord of the Rings actor's portrayal of the Duke of Sussex came just months after the royal told Dax Shepard's 'Armchair Expert' show that he'd struck up a bond with his new neighbours Orlando, 44, and singer Katy Perry, 36, who live 'just down the road' from the couple's £11million mansion in Montecito, California.

The Hollywood actor revealed how the Lord of the Rings star tipped him off about a photographer and that the pair 'keep in touch' over text.

Actor Alan Cumming has defended blistering royal satire The Prince and insisted it is 'not as mean as people think'. Cumming voices Owen, Prince George's butler (pictured)

In the satire, Prince Harry is shown coming to terms with his post-royal life as he and Meghan arrive in an LA apartment. Looking around, he says to his wife: 'This might be the smallest palace I have ever been in.'

Meghan corrects him: 'Well, it's an apartment,' to which Harry replies: 'Yes, an apartment palace, I know that. Lots of tiny palaces inside one big palace.'

In a previous interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Orlando Bloom said that 'It's not malicious or intended to be' and went on to say how it was wife Katy Perry who urged him to accept the role.

'Actually Katy saw one bit of it and was like, 'You've got to do this. This is genius.' And the animation is done by some of the guys who did Family Guy, so it's going to be very amusing,' Bloom said. 'And who doesn't love the royal family?'

The 12-episode series - which is available to stream in the US on HBO Max from today but is not yet airing in the UK - threatens to make a dent in the public images Harry and Meghan have spent months carefully crafting.

It has also drawn criticism from viewers over its decision to parody the young royals, with many noting George, Charlotte and Louis have not chosen their public lives.

Others said it was 'upsetting' to see Prince Philip ridiculed with gray skin and a hump back just a few months after his death at the age of 99.

Archie also features in the series but, unlike his cousins, does not appear to speak.

In one episode Harry ends up in a coffee shop after his TV projects fail. The story line is a nod to real life as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have secured a $140million Netflix (£100 million) deal.

On their way to their respective jobs on a bus, Harry asks her, 'Why are there so many people in our car? And why does it smell?'

When he arrives he asks his stunned trainer: ' My favorite drink is tea. I'd love to learn to make tea but is that too advanced?'

Meanwhile Meghan returns to her former career as an actress and leads classes. She is also seen auditioning for TV shows.

In episode two, Meghan asks Harry to look after Archie, who Harry mistakenly calls 'Arbie' and pick up milk while she goes to an audition.

Clearly confused by how to buy milk, Harry walks down the street and asks strangers: 'Milk?,' before finding his way to a grocery store.

'F*** me, the whole aisle is a refrigerator,' he says, after being directed to the milk. He hands over a gold ring to the member of staff who helped him and says: 'For your kindness'.

He proudly presents the milk to Meghan saying: 'You don't need to work anymore because I've found this! Game on America.'

His exasperated wife replies: 'Okay, well, you don't get paid for that but I'm super happy for you, you're figuring things out!'

Later Meghan phones Kate and says: 'Hi Kate, it's Meghan, just wondering if you've heard from Harry?' A bemused Kate asks: 'Meghan?'

The Duchess of Sussex replies: 'Meghan Markle, your sister-in-law?' The call ends after Kate is overheard telling William 'someone gave her our number'.

In another scene he is seen gasping at the dinner table, pointing Prince George to ask an aide to 'get the defibrillators ready'.

The 12-episode series - which is available to stream in the US on HBO Max but is not yet airing in the UK - was originally due to premiere in the spring but was delayed following the Duke of Edinburgh's death on April 9.

In a statement at the time, the network said: 'We were saddened to learn of Prince Philip's passing and will adjust plans for the series debut. A new date will be announced at a later time.'

However, actor Alan Cumming has defended blistering royal satire The Prince and insisted it is 'not as mean as people think'.

Cumming, 56, who voices Owen, Prince George's butler, told the Daily Telegraph the programme is 'actually quite tender' and urged people to 'watch it' before judging.

Asked if the Royal Family would find it funny, he said: 'I don't know. If they appreciate satire, they might… It's quite tender, actually – my character with George, it's a really lovely relationship. It's not as mean as people think.'

Mike claimed that felt bullied and Reza accused him of playing the victim.

Destiney Rose, 38, interjected and stated that Paulina was 'not here for a reason' and urged Mike to stop pretending that his life was perfect.

'That's a lie,' Destiney told him.

Mike privately spoke with Mercedes Javid, 49, who told Mike that his actions weren't matching his intentions.

Called out: 'That's a lie,' Destiney Rose said after Mike said he never gave Paulina reason to distrust him besides those raunchy texts

'You're not gonna lose that battle,' MJ said.

Tough love: 'Your intentions are, I will never hurt Paulina. In reality, you harmed and shattered and broke her heart,' MJ told him

'There's deep love that we have for each other, but above that there's some f***ing damage that was done. We're taking a few days of break and just giving each other some space, and that's that,' Mike said.

'So, you guys broke up?,' MJ asked.

'No, hell no. There's no breaking up in me and Paulina's relationship because we both don't think that way,' Mike said.

A break: 'No, hell no. There's no breaking up in me and Paulina's relationship because we both don't think that way,' Mike said

Mike then clarified that he didn't mean they took a relationship break, but just a break from each other.

They rejoined the group where GG had another exercise in which they wrote down what they wanted to release and then tossed the paper into a fire.

'The whole point of this trip, the whole thing I've been waiting for, is this moment right here, for everyone to say out loud to all of us what it is that you want, your intentions,' GG said.

Mike told his friends that social media had become a 'big problem' and he thrived on the attention.

GG chimed in that he should let go of Paulina and stop hurting her and her children while he's trying to get himself together.

Good question: GG's sister Leila asked Mike if he could be monogamous

Reza asked Mike if he pushed it past the point of no return with Paulia.

'I don't know. I'm hopeful that I didn't,' he replied.

'I'm addicted to attention,' Mike said.

'Of course, I like attention. It's human nature. If someone tells you, you look attractive today, you feel good about yourself, right? But I take it too far,' he added in a confessional.

Mike said he was capable of being monogamous and declared they were going to see a 'new Mike'.

The organizer: GG was impressed by Mike opening up and being honest

'A part of me doesn't believe it because I've heard this thing that he does all the time. 'I'm trying to get to a better place,' blah, blah, blah. But I also do hope that he's really taking the steps to make himself better. I really do. I'm that dumb b**** that believes there's always a rainbow on the other side of a rainy day,' Destiney said in a confessional.

The episode also showed Reza writing an apology letter to MJ's husband Tommy who has forbidden his son Shams from meeting Reza after a nasty falling out.

MJ delivered the letter, but Tommy ripped it up without reading it.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Katie Price has been defended by fans after trolls slammed the star when her son Jett's name was incorrectly spelled in a birthday video on Instagram.

The former glamour model, 43, took to the social media platform to share a series of sweet pictures of her and Jett, whom she shares with ex-husband Kieran Hayler, to celebrate his 8th birthday.

The video sees a spelling mistake in the message: 'Happy Birthday Jet!', to which trolls attacked her with one penning: 'You'd think they'd have spelt his name right.'

Cruel: Katie Price, 43, was cruelly attacked by trolls after misspelling her son Jett's name in a birthday video on Instagram on Thursday

The mum-of-five seemed to re-share the video from a fan page, as she thanked another user at the end of the video: 'Thanks to Ruby at the Pricey Fan Page for making this X'.

Katie captioned the birthday tribute to her son: 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY JETT'.

'Happy 8th Birthday to my baby boy Jett , it wasn’t a great start in life with my waters breaking in France and him being born early and the horrid circumstances at the time and intensive care but he was strong and turned out to be my gorgeous lovable mini bear grills watch out for the next adventurer I love you so much'.

Others chimed in to troll Katie and the fan-site, saying: 'You'd think the fan page would've spelt his name right! and 'It's Jett, not Jet.'

Spelling mishap: The video sees a spelling mistake in the message: 'Happy Birthday Jet!', to which trolls attacked her, saying 'You get the award for the worst celebrity parent ever'

Meanwhile, others took to her comments section, highlighting the fact that Katie was abroad in St Lucia for her son's birthday.

'Missed yet another child's birthday because of your holiday' commented one troll.

'Katie your missing all your children's birthdays and important milestones been away. Happy birthday Jett xx' another said.

The star's youngest daughter Bunny also celebrated her 7th birthday last week whilst Katie was away.

Bad timing: Other cyberbullies took to her comments section, highlighting the fact that Katie was holidaying over her son's birthday - without him

However, other fans rushed to Katie's defence, calling her 'an absolutely awesome mom'.

'The Best Mother, I love you Katie', one fan commented.

'Omg whats with all the negative comments on Katie's post? She is a better than the rest of you will ever be, leave her be, her kids adore her and she is a fantastic mother.'

'Happy birthday Jett! ignore all the idiots, everyone is actually so judgmental and disrespectful towards a post on a child’s birthday. He deserves more than a bunch of adults trying to slate his mum for when she posts. A post on social media first thing or last is completely irrelevant to when she’s said hbd herself' another dan commented.

Kind support: However, fans rushed to Katie's defence, calling her 'an absolutely awesome mom'

Her birthday post celebrating Jett comes after Katie set off to St Lucia with her fiancé Carl Woods and children Harvey, 19, and Princess, 13.

Katie made the most of her fun-filled trip by enjoying some pampering, a water park and an entertaining private chef.

Katie enjoyed a private helicopter ride with her family as she kick started her fourth trip abroad in two months - shortly after she was unknowingly embroiled in an online scam.

Katie fled the UK for sunny Saint Lucia with her family two weeks ago after being left 'absolutely devastated' that her fans had lost thousands of pounds because she promoted a conman's business on Instagram.

After arriving on the island, Katie's fiancé shared selfies with her daughter and filmed her son Harvey as they prepared to fly in a helicopter.

Carl captured a helicopter on a runway as the former Love Islander, Katie, Princess and her son Harvey made their way towards it.

'Harv' what do you reckon, on a helicopter?' he said to her eldest child who excitedly responded: 'Yes!'

'I bet you can't wait!' Carl added. Flight attendants gingerly carried their luggage to the aircraft before loading it on board.

Katie grabbed Harvey's top and guided him towards the helicopter entrance doorway while her fiancé gave an animated expression towards his camera.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@London Underground was a mini-pioneer back in 2005. It led the way with a new form of advertising, replacing static posters with digital panels that changed as passengers rode up and down the escalators.

The idea came from an American advertising agency, whose UK managing director at the time was Tim Bleakley.

Today, Bleakley runs Ocean Outdoor, which specialises in high quality digital advertising in busy places, such as the Printworks entertainment centre in Manchester, the Aston Expressway in Birmingham and London's Westfield shopping malls. It also operates in cities in Scandinavia and the Netherlands.

Good catch: Ocean Outdoor used 3D screens in Piccadilly Circus to promote the British and Irish Lions' recent tour

Digital displays have come a long way over the past 16 years. In streets, squares and retail hubs, Ocean broadcasts big events interlaced with ads, from Team GB's recent successes in Tokyo to the Queen's address to the nation during the first lockdown.

Panels strategically placed by roads that see heavy traffic can identify the make and model of individual cars and serve drivers with specific adverts, from insurance to rival vehicles.

A Royal Navy ad for the Submarine Service changes shape when people look at it for more than a few seconds, showing QR codes which take viewers straight to the Navy's recruitment website.

The company has also started producing 3D ads which appear to come out of the screen, such as a Vodafone British and Irish Lions campaign at Piccadilly Circus during the rugby team's recent test series against South Africa.

Ocean did its bit during the pandemic too, running ads for the NHS, offering cut-price deals for small businesses and supporting local heroes with creative displays.

Notwithstanding Bleakley's efforts through successive lockdowns, Ocean had a rough time last year.

With consumers stuck at home, outdoor advertising had limited appeal so 2020 turnover fell 38 per cent to £86million, the company recorded a pre-tax loss of £10.8million and the workforce was cut by 16 per cent to just over 230 staff.

However, Bleakley and his team used the year wisely, bedding down 2019 acquisitions, renegotiating contracts with landlords and investing in the future.

Demand is now recovering fast and brokers expect turnover of £107million this year, rising to £125million in 2022.

A small loss is likely again in 2021 but profits of £14.5million are forecast for next year, with further substantial gains pencilled in subsequently.

Big companies are increasingly drawn to digital advertising because they can do more with the medium and consumers tend to look at it for longer. Adverts can also be highly targeted around large events, from the UEFA Champions League to WWE wrestling matches.

Political events can be big draws too. Ahead of COP 26 – this autumn's environmental summit – Ocean held a sealed bid auction, recognising that demand for its panels would be strong at such a high-profile event.

The response has been enthusiastic, which should bolster revenues as the year draws to a close. Further ahead, Ocean is set on greater expansion, both organically and via acquisition.

New contracts are expected in places where the company already has a presence, there are plans to acquire more sites in the UK and Northern Europe and constant technological improvements should drive sales growth.

Acquisitions are also on the cards, both in existing locations and elsewhere.

Some large investors have questioned Ocean's exposure to shopping malls, given the popularity of e-commerce but Bleakley is sanguine, pointing out that, even if habits change, people will still always want to go out.

Ocean and its customers can swiftly adapt, placing screens where they will be seen.

Ocean is listed in London and its financial figures are produced in pounds and pence but the shares are priced in dollars, closing at $8.38 last week.

The anomaly arose because Ocean began as a public company by reversing into a shell firm backed by US investors. Over time, the stock should start to trade in sterling. Until then, investors can trade shares as easily as if they were quoted in our home currency.

Midas verdict: Digital advertising is one of the fastest-growing areas of the advertising sector and Ocean Outdoor is a leader in the field. Bleakley has years of experience, he is ambitious for the business and prospects are bright. At $8.38, the shares are a buy.

He put on an energetic display while larking around on stage and singing into the microphone, ensuring to dazzle his fans in the audience.

The Dance With Me Tonight hitmaker also took to Instagram to share a photo in his colourful getup, looking like a trooper as he stood in his knee support.

Last Tuesday Olly took to Instagram to share his story of the freak accident, telling fans: 'It's been a mad 72 hours', Olly admitted that he initially 'thought the worst' after worrying he had 'done his knee again'.

He also shared a photo of two small bones that had been removed from his knee.

Wearing his hospital gown, the star thanked fans for their support and insisted he will still perform his scheduled shows this month, although his performances may not be as energetic.

Olly said in full: 'Hey everyone, what's happening. You're probably thinking, what is going on? Why is Olly in a hospital bed? Well, I've just had surgery on my left leg, and as you can see, I've got my game on already to ice it.

Basically, for some of you who came to my Newmarket gig on Friday, thank you firstly for your kind messages and support and checking I was OK.

'It's been a mad 72 hours since the gig getting to this point. Basically, after my second song, a fragment of bone which was in my knee managed to lodge itself to the back of my knee after I jumped and basically shut my leg down.#

'During the gig, I was just limping the whole time, I couldn't believe it. So basically I'm in, I've had the surgery, I wanted to get this done because I've got the Newby gig on the 14th and the Singleton Park on the 15th.

Grateful: The star thanked fans for their support and insisted he will still perform his scheduled shows this month, although his performances may not be as energetic

'So I wanted to make sure I got this done for you guys. It will be a different gig, I probably won't be running around like I normally do, there might be a stool for me to sit down on, but I can't cancel these gigs for you guys.

'It was such an amazing vibe on Friday at Newmarket so I'll give it absolutely everything next week for you all.'

Now, Olly took the audience by storm at the racecourse in his first show since the ordeal.

Also heading up to the races today was former Love Islander Sharon Gaffka and former jockey and ITV and Sky Sports presenter Leonna Mayor.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@He's the highest-earning ‘talent’ at the BBC and is kicking off another season of Match Of The Day this weekend – part of a starring role at the Corporation that earns him £1.36 million a year.

Now Gary Lineker, 60, has scored another big payday over at rival team ITV as host of a new gameshow – with the rather appropriate title Sitting On A Fortune.

It’s just another job up front for the former goalscorer at Leicester, Spurs and Barcelona who, since retiring from football in 1994, has transformed himself into one of television’s most sought-after presenters.

Becoming a gameshow host will mean Lineker now has nine jobs.

Apart from his high-profile presenting roles, he features in big-brand television advertising campaigns and also runs a TV production company – which he uses to sell even more of his work to the BBC.

It’s certainly a big fixture list to juggle and it all got us thinking – how does Gary find the extra time to do all this…

Walkers Crisps

One of his first TV jobs was as the face of Walkers crisps, and the Leicester-born star last year signed a new three-year deal with the firm – the snacks are made in his home city.

The deal sees him feature in television advert campaigns and on social media.

He has been working with the brand for 27 years, first teaming up with Walkers in 1994, and has now appeared in 150 adverts.

Gary Lineker has been working with the brand for 27 years, first teaming up with Walkers in 1994, and has now appeared in 150 adverts

Earlier this year he found himself at the centre of an unexpected race row over his latest lucrative advert.

The commercial, which promoted the company’s tie-in with KFC, has been described as racist for perpetuating a negative stereotype of black people liking fried chicken.

Ticker Car Insurance

Lineker is an investor in an insurance company which aims to reduce premiums for drivers between the ages of 17 and 25.

Ticker sends a box to the driver which they then place on their windscreen.

The gadget pairs to a phone via bluetooth, sending the driver’s behaviour on the road to the Ticker app, with the idea that the information can be used to provide cheaper insurance for safer young motorists.

Described as the future of car insurance, the company is also backed by former Formula 1 driver Mark Blundell.

BBC/Match of the Day

As part of Lineker’s £1.36 million deal with the Beeb, he presents Match Of The Day and other big sporting events.

This summer he fronted many of the Euro 2020 matches both from Wembley and the BBC studios in Salford.

He is also one of the hosts of the Sports Personality of the Year event.

Lineker is paid nicely for it all too. He was the organisation’s biggest earner for the 2020-21 financial year – even after taking a £400,000 pay cut from the year before when the Corporation paid him £1.75 million.

Few BBC viewers will know that some of the programmes Lineker hosts are not part of his deal with the broadcaster but shows he sells to them through his production company.

Last year he hosted and made Football, Prince William And Our Mental Health through Goalhanger Films.

He has made others for the Corporation with stars including Marcus Rashford and Wayne Rooney, and featuring his beloved Leicester City.

He also produces podcasts for the BBC. He recently announced a show he is making about tennis superstar Serena Williams, which he has sold to Amazon.

La Liga

Lineker quit one big-money deal at BT Sport for another – transferring to La Liga to present football matches from the top Spanish division, live from Barcelona.

Lineker still speaks Spanish after his time playing for the Catalan giants and he signed a multi-year contract with LaLigaTV ahead of the new season.

Speaking of his new job, he said he was ‘thrilled’, adding: ‘I have fond memories of my time playing in Spain and very much look forward to sharing the excitement of La Liga with viewers in the UK and elsewhere.’

Books

In 2019, along with his friend and fellow broadcaster Danny Baker, Lineker published a book full of football anecdotes called Behind Closed Doors.

A bestseller, it was culled from a podcast the pair presented and reveals jaw-dropping stories from the dressing room and open-top bus ceremonies, apparently ‘all served up with lashings of wit and ribald humour.’

Vision Express

As one of television’s most prominent spectacle-wearers, it was only a matter of time before Lineker cashed in on them.

He promotes his own range of sunglasses and glasses, which he handpicks, for high street chain Vision Express.

The firm says in the ‘edit’, Lineker ‘pays homage to the various fashion eras and styles which have influenced him throughout his life, specifically Italian and Mediterranean styles.’

And he’s hoping to score with the public in terms of pricing – Lineker spectacle frames cost from £99 and sunglasses are from £39.

TM Lewin

Lineker is renowned for his snappy suits when presenting his TV shows, which was clearly noticed by upmarket shirt brand TM Lewin, which signed him up to promote the label.

He has appeared on its website where he has advertised the budget range, starting at £25.

He also used to encourage his millions of social media followers to shop at TM Lewin stores before the business went online only.

In one he wrote: ‘What better way to finish off the week than a new shoot wearing Britain’s Favourite Shirt. The @tmlewin pure two-fold cotton essential shirt has got me covered for all-day wear.’

ITV gameshow

Last month it was announced that Lineker would be straddling the BBC and ITV after being lured by the latter to host a new gameshow, named Sitting On A Fortune.

In the show contestants can win up to £100,000 and it seems the presenter has hit the jackpot too.

Lineker said: ‘I am delighted to be hosting what I think and hope will be a show that people love, full of tension with high stakes and bags of drama from start to finish – everything a great game show should be.’

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Johnny Depp said that he's being boycotted by Hollywood amid 'an unpleasant and messy situation' in his split with ex-wife Amber Heard.

The 58-year-old actor spoke with The Sunday Times about his new drama Minamata, which has not yet secured a U.S. release.

The Kentucky-born actor chalked up the professional difficulties to the 'absurdity of media mathematics' in the wake of a 'surreal five years' following his 2016 split with Heard amid allegations of domestic violence.

The latest: Johnny Depp, 58, said that he's being boycotted by Hollywood amid 'an unpleasant and messy situation' in his split with ex-wife Amber Heard, 35. He was snapped last year in Zurich, Switzerland

The actor, who's played roles such as Edward Scissorhands, Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow, last year lost a libel case against the outlet The Sun over their reporting of the split, labeling him a 'wife-beater.'

Amid the headlines, MGM has suspended the release of Minamata, which is directed by Andrew Levitas and in which Depp plays the role of photojournalist W Eugene Smith, in his 1970s work in Japan.

Last month, Levitas wrote a letter to MGM accusing it of 'burying' the motion picture as result of Depp's legal issues, Deadline reported. The movie was acquired by MGL last fall, via its American International Pictures, after its February 2020 debut at the Berlin International Film Festival.

Depp told The Sunday Times: 'Some films touch people and this affects those in Minamata and people who experience similar things. And for anything … for Hollywood’s boycott of me? One man, one actor in an unpleasant and messy situation, over the last number of years?'

Depp, who was replaced in the Fantastic Beasts anthology last year by Warner Bros., said he was 'moving towards' bringing 'things to light.'

Amid the career crisis in the U.S., Depp is set to be honored by Spain's San Sebastian film festival next month, and the Czech Republic's Karlovy Vary International Film Festival later this month.

The Karlovy Vary International Film Festival stated it would 'recognize and pay tribute to the acclaimed actor’s extensive career and lasting legacy on the film industry globally.'

For the San Sebastian film festival, Depp is set to be given the Donostia Award for his 'outstanding contributions to the film world.'

Amid the career crisis in the U.S., Depp is set to be honored by Spain's San Sebastian film festival next month, and the Czech Republic's Karlovy Vary International Film Festival later this month

That decision came under scrutiny from female filmmakers organizations in Spain.

The country's Association of Female Filmmakers and Audiovisual Media's president Cristina Andreu last week told the AP that the decision 'speaks very badly of the festival and its leadership, and transmits a terrible message to the public: "It doesn’t matter if you are an abuser as long as you are a good actor."'

Depp in March was denied an appeal in the Heard case, with a British court saying his efforts had 'no real prospect of success.'

He also remains in litigation in the states in a $50 million suit against Heard, which has been delayed until next year.

Nyong'o's appearance at the event comes prior to the premiere of two major film projects with which she was involved.

The performer is currently set to feature in the forthcoming spy film The 355, where she will play an MI6 agent named Khadijah.

Also set to appear in the Simon Kinberg-directed film are actresses such as Jessica Chastain, Penelope Cruz and Diane Kruger, among others.

The concept for the film was worked out by its director and the Zero Dark Thirty star during the filming of X-Men: Dark Phoenix.

Staying busy: Nyong'o is currently set to appear in one of the main roles in the upcoming spy film, The 355

The cast was brought together in 2019, and filming started in July of that year.

Production moved through several different locations before additional shots were finished the following year.

Although the upcoming film was supposed to have its major debut this past January, it was delayed due to the ongoing state of the global pandemic.

The 355 is currently set to have its premiere on January 7th, 2022.

Nyong'o will also appear in the forthcoming Marvel feature, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which serves as a sequel to the original 2018 film.

The feature began being actively developed shortly after the release of the first movie, and director Ryan Coogler signed on to helm the follow-up that October.

However, the project entered an uncertain state after Chadwick Boseman, who starred as the titular character, suddenly passed away in August of 2020.

After a period of restructuring, the film was confirmed to still be in development, and Nyong'o was confirmed to be reprising her role as Nakia in the sequel.

Doing it again: Nyong'o will also reprise her role as Nakia in the upcoming Marvel feature Black Panther: Wakanda Forever; she is seen alongside Chadwick Boseman in the original 2018 film

The pair looked cosy at the dinner table as Hugo placed his arm around the back of the civil servant's chair while they posed for a photo during a night out last week.

Since leaving the villa, Sharon has revealed her shock that candid discussions she had about her race and sexuality were cut from the show.

The Young Women's Trust ambassador told Metro Online last week that Faye Winter, 26, had asked her if she was bisexual.

During her time on the show, it was made known in a game that she had previously had a threesome involving another woman.

Sharon, said that the aired scenes only scratched the surface of the discussion of modern dating and her sexual experiences on the show, and it is now apparent that the rest of the scenes from the conversation were left out.

'A lot of the conversations I had about modern dating on the show were never aired, but I was very open about sexuality and being a mixed-race woman in modern dating.'

One fan asked if the decision was health-related, to which Simon replied: 'I’m ok… just got fed up of betrayal.'

'I'm so sad. It's like my parents were getting divorced. If you are happy with this decision then we fans are happy for you too,' the Cure lover penned.

Way back when: Frontman Robert Smith branded the bassist as the 'heart of the band' and 'his best friend', to NME in 2019 (Robert, left, and Simon, right, pictured above in 1989)

The English band, formed in 1978, have yet to comment on Simon's departure but frontman Robert Smith, 62, told The Irish Times three years ago that if Simon left, 'it wouldn’t be called the Cure.'

Robert also branded the bassist as the 'heart of the band' and 'his best friend', to NME in 2019.

'For me, the heart of the live band has always been Simon, and he’s always been my best friend. It’s weird that over the years and the decades he’s often been overlooked.

'He doesn’t do interviews, he isn’t really out there and he doesn’t play the role of a foil to me in public, and yet he’s absolutely vital to what we do,' he said.

Rock stars: The Cure released their debut album Three Imaginary Boys in 1979 and it wasn't long after that Simon joined the West Sussex band (pictured above in 1997)

The Cure released their debut album Three Imaginary Boys in 1979 and it wasn't long after that Simon joined the West Sussex band.

The rock star appeared on all three LPs in their Dark Trilogy - Seventeen Seconds (1980), Faith (1981) and Pornography (1982).

He temporarily left the band as a result of tensions with Robert but rejoined in 1984 and remained as their bassist before announcing his exit.

Robert admitted to New Zealand presenter Zane Lowe back in June that the band had recorded two new albums, despite their latest dating back to 2008.

Hinting it could be their last work, he said: 'I can’t think we’ll ever do anything else. I definitely can’t do this again.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Another week, another house price index stating record growth.

This time it was the turn of Nationwide, which said prices had risen 10.9 per cent in the year to April, reaching a new high of £242,832 - up by £23,930 compared with 12 months earlier.

Most experts say this is down to people's changing lifestyles during the pandemic and the incentive provided by the Government's stamp duty holiday. But are there other forces at play?

Fred Harrison, a British author and economic commentator, successfully predicted the previous two property crashes years before they occurred - and his 18-year property cycle theory says that house prices should continue to boom before crashing in 2026.

His theory is based on analysis of 300 years of data, and suggests that the underlying force behind rising prices in the property market is the finite supply of land.

This, he says, combines with greed and speculation to turbo-charge sentiment and send prices spiralling before a bubble bursts.

Given that early predictions of a house price crash during the pandemic were wildly inaccurate, does his model provide a better idea of what might really happen?

The average house price has rocketed over the past year, will values keep climbing?

On this week's podcast, Georgie Frost, Tanya Jefferies and Helen Crane also look at the other factors shaping the housing market, including tantalisingly cheap mortgages with two-year fixed rates as low as 0.99 per cent.

But aside from these headline-grabbing rates, the typical mortgage has actually become slightly more expensive in the last year - so why are experts saying locking in for five years is still a good idea?

One group that isn't so happy about this year's house price increases is first-time buyers - especially those who took out Help to Buy loans a few years ago and are now paying back inflated sums into the Government coffers based on their homes' increased values.

Helen discusses whether they should hold off paying back the loans in the face of spiralling interest - and whether today's first-time buyers should still consider using Help to Buy at what is widely tipped to be the top of the market.

Do you want an 'essential', comfortable or luxurious retirement? New research explains how much you will need to put away to get the lifestyle you want in your later years

Away from housing, we talk about the latest research telling us how much we need for a decent retirement - depending on whether we want an 'essential', comfortable or more luxurious time of it in our older years.

Tanya explains how much people should be putting away, and how that changes if you are single rather than part of a couple.

We also discuss controversial comments made by Paul Johnson from economic and public finance policy unit the Institute for Fiscal Studies, IFS, who said most people don't need to worry too much about saving into their pension until they are in their 50s.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Households have been hungry for takeaways during the pandemic, as lockdowns have forced us all to stay indoors.

But as restrictions start to lift in many western countries, a key question is whether this insatiable appetite will keep on growing – or shrink again as economies reopen.

That will be on the minds of investors as they pore over Just Eat Takeaway.com's half-year results on Tuesday.

The firm is Britain's biggest food delivery giant, but is jostling for dominance with rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats.

And this week, results from Deliveroo seemed to show that the pandemic takeaways boom continued in the first half of this year.

But in an ominous sign for the sector, the firm warned that the recent rapid growth was expected to 'moderate' in the second half of 2021.

Figures also showed the company's pace of sales expansion had already slowed from the first to second quarters.

In recent years, Just Eat has sought to bolster takeaway sales from independent restaurants by also partnering with bigger brands such as McDonald's and KFC.

Analysts will be on the look out for any clues as to Just Eat's future intentions, as well as for signs about how much it thinks pandemic trends will persist.

They expect the firm to post full-year revenues of £3.7billion in 2021 – compared to £2billion a year previously – so will also be watching for signs this is still on track.

On Friday Just Eat shares rose 1.3 per cent, or 79p, to 6180p.

Holly Willoughby had let slip the same day in March that Charlotte had welcomed her third child during an appearance on This Morning, saying to her: 'You've got three kids now!'

She said: 'You've got the three kids now. How is home schooling?', as Charlotte replied: 'I've been homeschooling my own children now for a few years now.'

Charlotte's latest post comes a week after she shared a hilarious video pleading with Instagram to verify her account after having her application for a blue tick rejected nine times, with the singer having since received verification.

The star mimicked Dr. Evil from Austin Powers by slowly stroking her dog while making her plea in video shared on the platform.

Speaking softly against a background of classical music, she mused: 'Instagram, why won't you verify me? I've tried nine times now and you just keep telling me that I don't meet the criteria.'

Charlotte added: 'I wonder if there are any other Instagrammers out there who've had a similar problem that can help me figure it out. I would dearly, dearly love a blue tick'.

Cupping her face with her hands, the singer then quipped: 'I really am Charlotte Church!'

Captioning the video on social media she wrote: 'Hello darlings! Please help me get verified on @instagram' with a sobbing emoji.

'I'm having trouble getting verified and wanted to prove I was really me! If anyone has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it ❤️ x'

As the Full House star took to her Instagram to post a picture of the pair, many pointed out that Candace, 45, and her child looked more like sisters than mother-and-daughter.

'Happy 23rd birthday to this beauty,' Candace wrote under the birthday snap, adding: 'I love you my Tashi.'

'You could be sisters!' Candace Cameron, 45, wishes daughter Natasha a happy 23rd birthday... as fans react in disbelief saying it's hard to tell who is who

The duo were both wearing matching outfits in denim jumpsuits, with their hair styled similarly - prompting fans to flood the comment section about how alike they appeared.

One fan wrote: 'You could be sisters! Hard to tell which one is turning 23, if you didn't know already.'

Another comment read: 'Which one?? You could both pass for 23.'

'My gosh. You look like sisters. Happy Birthday and happy gave birth day to you hot momma,' said another, among many similar messages.

One Instagram users even said the pair looked like 'twins' commenting on their similar hairstyles.

Candace shares Natasha, and sons Lev, 21, and Maksim, 19, with her husband Val Bure, 47, whom she has been married to since 1996.

Natasha has found fame as a YouTuber, where she has 265k subscribers, and often posts about her workout and makeup routines.

Lookalike: Fans were left wondering who was who in Candace's latest Instagram snaps with her daughter (Pictured above in 2014)

Meanwhile her mom recently got herself in hot water thanks to the content on her social media pages.

Last month, she apologized to fans after she was criticized for posting a 'seductive' TikTok video where she posed with a bible while lip-syncing to the Lana Del Rey song Jealous Girl.

In the video, the actress, who is a devout Christian, mouths the lyrics, 'Baby, I'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango / You don't wanna dance with me, dance with me,' while a caption across the video said: 'When they don't know the power of the Holy Spirit.'

However, some deemed the video offensive prompting the Fuller House star to take down the video on her Instagram feed, saying it was not her intention for the clip to be deemed as 'weird' or 'seductive.'

'I just came home and read a lot of messages that were not happy with my latest Instagram post that was a TikTok video,' Candace said in her apology.

'And I usually don't apologize for these things, but a lot of you thought it was weird and I'm sorry. That was not my intention,' she added.

'I was using a very specific clip from TikTok and applying it to the power of the Holy Spirit, which is incredible. So many of you thought I was trying to be seductive, which clearly means I'm not a very good actress because I was trying to be strong, not sexy. So I guess that didn't work, but I deleted it.'

Some fans commented that the post seemed 'sexy' which they felt was inappropriate considering she was holding up a copy of the Bible.

Candace had tried to pin it on her daughter Natasha who posted a similar video, saying she was trying to follow her lead.

'Maybe I was just trying to be too cool or relevant in a Biblical way that didn't work," she explained in her Instagram video.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lady Kitty Spencer shared an unseen wedding photo as she wished dress designer Domenico Dolce's a happy birthday in a gushing Instagram post.

Princess Diana's niece, 30, tied the knot with Michael Lewis, 62, in Rome in late July, in a lavish weekend-long wedding complete with fireworks, a £20,000-a-night venue and a wardrobe full of custom D&G gowns.

Dolce & Gabbana co-founder Domenico Dolce, who turned 63 on Friday, worked on Kitty's wedding wardrobe.

Sharing a picture of one of her dress fittings with Domenico on Instagram, Kitty marked his special day by saying he had made her 'dreams come true'.

Lady Kitty Spencer shared an unseen wedding photo as she wished dress designer Domenico Dolce's a happy birthday in a gushing Instagram post

The night before the wedding, Kitty wore a baby-blue tulle gown and cape embroidered with cross-stitched flowers also made for her by Dolce & Gabbana. This is the dress she wears in the black and white photo shared on Instagram

'Happy happy birthday to the man who makes dreams come true and brings fairytales to life, Domenico Dolce,' Kitty said.

'Thank you for another year of friendship: for our laughter, brainstorming sessions, your brilliant stories and your guidance.

'You are always right and it is my privilege to be guided by your wisdom and vision, I love you.'

Princess Diana's niece, 30, is the global ambassador for Dolce & Gabbana and dressed exclusively in dresses by the Italian design house for her hen do, wedding and honeymoon.

For the three-day wedding, D&G created five different custom creations, including the breathtaking Victorian-inspired lace gown she wore down the aisle.

These were paired with earrings, necklaces and rings from the label's exclusive Alta Gioielleria high jewellery collection.

Prices for these diamond and jewel-encrusted pieces are not publicly available but start from £25,000, and raise to approximately £510,000 for top-of-the-range necklace.

Fortunately for Kitty, it is highly unlikely she would have paid for the jewels.

'It's most likely she didn't pay for these, the same as when celebrities wear red carpet jewels they are mostly lent rather than purchased,' explained Amber Gordon of UK-based luxury personal shopping and fashion concierge service Tailored Styling, which specialises in finding one-of-a-kind pieces for shoppers.

The same is true of the dresses.

'If she did it certainly would not have been the amount a regular client would have paid,' Amber explained. 'Dolce has heavily promoted the content and so are definitely benefitting from the partnership too.'

Kitty spent the days leading up to the ceremony travelling around the Florence region with some of her closest girlfriends.

It is believed the totality of her hen do outfits cost more than £7,500.

The group enjoyed a sidecar tour of the surrounding wine country as one of their activities, stopping at a Chianti vineyard to try the wine.

They also made the most of Florence's bars and restaurants, sharing photos of their adventures on social media.

Kitty wore several stunning outfits for her pre-wedding celebrations, including a D&G printed charmeuse polka dot dress, £1,800, which she wore with a now discontinued 'devotion' bag in wicker and calfskin, thought to be worth £2,800.

Another evening, the bride-to-be stepped out in a D&G leopard print dress, thought to be worth £1,500, that fit her like a glove.

No expense spared: Kitty's stunning wardrobe, which is thought to have been worth more than £2.5million. The highlight was this magnificent Victorian-inspired wedding gown by D&G

She carried her essentials in a £1,400 'devotion' crossbody bag in quilted nappa leather.

For the piece de resistance, Kitty's rehearsal dinner and wedding day outfit, including her delightful wedding dress, were estimated at an eye-watering £2m.

On the day itself Kitty wore three ever-more breathtaking dresses featuring yards of lace, silk and tulle.

The star of the show was the high-necked Victorian-inspired lace gown worn for the ceremony, which was made over six months.

It was followed by a double organza hand-painted silk gown embellished with flowers and crystals, and a glitzy gold evening dress worn to party the night away.

The night before the wedding, Kitty wore a baby-blue tulle gown and cape embroidered with cross-stitched flowers also made for her by Dolce & Gabbana.

It was followed by a double organza hand-painted silk gown embellished with flowers and crystals. Each look was finished with exquisite jewels worn on the ears and neck

Amber estimates each of these creations would have cost in the region of £60,000, if not more.

Each ensemble was finished with pieces from the high jewellery collection. It is not possible to put a price on each piece but the three necklaces could be in the region of £500,000 each.

Even if the four sets of earrings were on the cheaper end of the pricing scale, this would bring the total value of jewellery to somewhere in the region of £2million.

The day after their wedding, Kitty and Michael invited friends and family back to the castle to enjoy a meal in the grounds.

The bride wore her fifth custom D&G gown for the event. This one, which is also estimated to cost in the region of £60,000, featured intricate handmade flower appliqué and a structured bodice.

Unlike the other wedding weekend dresses, this one was not full length, allowing Kitty to show off her £575 D&G Nappa leather sliders with baroque logo.

She also wore a pair of £219 D&G sunglasses when arriving at the venue.

Once again she was adorned with a glittering necklace, again estimated to be in the region of £500,000, and a pair of matching earrings.

On Monday Kitty continued the fun at an al fresco lunch with friends - and showcased yet another bright and breezy D&G ensemble.

The socialite joined pals Pixie Lott, designer Jade Holland Cooper and her husband Superdry founder Julian Dunkerton, for a meal at an upmarket restaurant with stunning views over the city.

For the outing Kitty opted for the label's Camellia-print ruffled silk-blend midi dress, which retails for £2,350. The typically feminine dress has a retro-inspired feel and is trimmed with organza ruffles along the crossover V-neckline and midi hem.

Kitty swept her blonde locks back into a ponytail, giving a glimpse of the glittering £25,000 necklace with multi-coloured gems hanging around her neck.

She added a favourite pair of red D&G slip-on mules with a gold logo on the toe.

The bride wore the same outfit for dinner with Michael and her family that night.

Newlywed Kitty looked every inch the high-end holidaymaker as she and Michael arrived on the Amalfi Coast on Tuesday to kick start their honeymoon.

Kitty breezed into the five-star Positano hotel in a £1,500 printed cotton-poplin D&G midi dress decorated with the brand's signature medieval-inspired 'Carretto' print.

The frock has a nipped-in waist and falls to a full, pleated skirt with delicate mother of pearl buttons.

She accessorised with a £975 embroidered D&G straw beach bag, £925 D&G sandals and finished the look with a pair of sunglasses, thought to cost £237 from D&G.

Pete kept it casual in a grey long-sleeved striped shirt with black jeans and matching sneakers.

According to Deadline, Meet Cute 'is a wildly inventive deconstruction of the romantic comedy built around the question: What would you do if you could travel to your loved ones’ past, heal their traumas, fix their problems, and change them into the perfect partner?'

In June the producer shared a post to Instagram announcing news of the new romantic comedy with the SNL star. 'This one's gonna be real cute...' she gushed.

Since then the bombshell has teased photos of the pair working together.

Cuoco teased a black and white photo from the set of their film with the caption, 'You're gonna love them.' Underneath the image she wrote their characters' names, 'Sheila and Gary.'

Over the weekend it was reported that the SNL star had split with Phoebe Dynevor after five months of dating.

'It was pretty telling when Phoebe headed to Croatia with her mates this week rather than going to see Pete in America.

'It was wild while it lasted... But the distance has put a strain on them. They will remain close but unless something drastic changes their relationship won't recover.'

The source continued that both of the stars have very busy schedules at the moment, with Phoebe filming Bridgerton series two in the UK and Pete working on Saturday Night Live in the US as well as filming a movie called Meet Cute.

It is also thought that travel restrictions have added a further pressure to their romance as it isn't easy to just 'jump on a plane' and see each other.

MailOnline has contacted Phoebe and Pete's representatives for further comment.

Phoebe and Pete are thought to have started dating in February, with her taking a trip to NYC the same month, and they confirmed their romance in April.

In exclusive pictures obtained by MailOnline the duo were seen enjoying a stroll in Stoke-on-Trent during his visit to the UK.

It has been previously reported that Pete fell for her after watching her raunchy love scenes on Bridgerton.

The Saturday Night Live star is said to have told pals he thought the actress was 'hot as hell' over her character Daphne's intimate scenes with Simon, The Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page).

A Los Angeles based friend of Pete's told The Mirror: 'Pete just loved Bridgerton and just got totally tripped out by Phoebe.

'She was totally his type - fresh faced, youthful, innocent looking beauty.

'We all joked with him about the naughty scenes, and of course he confessed he found them hot. He binge watched the show and felt it was his destiny to meet her.'

MailOnline contacted a representative for Pete Davidson for comment at the time.

The reports of their break-up come as Phoebe enjoys a sun-soaked break in Croatia with her co-star Sabrina Bartlett.

In snaps shared on Instagram, the actress wowed in an orange bikini as she took a bike ride before having cocktails with pal, 29, who plays Siena Rosso in Bridgerton.

The pair also enjoyed an Aperol Spritz in the sunshine as they posed for a glowing selfie together before heading out on a fun boat trip.

The stars - who are both based in the UK - will not have to quarantine when they come home as Croatia is currently on the green travel list.

Filming on the second series of Bridgerton was recently delayed yet again after a Covid outbreak on set.

The stalling is said to be causing Netflix 'an expensive headache'.

Due to a previous case, shooting had only just resumed again - but a day after cast and crew returned to the period drama things are once again on ice.

The likes of Phoebe and co-star Jonathan Bailey, who plays Viscount Anthony Bridgerton, have had to cease work while various members of the production isolate.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Mike Padgham bought a Scarborough cafe bar in June 2019, it was his first foray into the hospitality sector.

He and son Jordan, 26, the manager, were full of excitement as they recruited staff and refurbished The Hideout. But nine months later, the Padghams were forced to shut as the first national lockdown took hold. Within weeks they had furloughed all their employees and taken out a £50,000 ‘bounce back’ loan.

When restrictions on indoor dining were lifted in May, they hoped to be able to get back on track. But the curse of the NHS Covid-19 app has since cost them £13,500. Mike, 65, tells Fiona Parker how the ‘pingdemic’ wreaked havoc on his business.

Fearing the next ping: Mike Padgham the owner of The Hideout cafe in Scarborough who had to close for after four staff were pinged

Sunday, June 27: Our first employee is ‘pinged’ at around 5.30pm. He is a waiter who had been walking home from his shift. We have about 20 employees who work from either 8am to 4pm or 4pm to 10pm, with 11pm closing times on Friday and Saturday. He rings Jordan and my son tells the other staff. Some carry on working as normal but others are anxious that they might have caught the virus. I oversee the financial side of the business while Jordan spends more time in the restaurant.

We are in no doubt that our waiter has to self-isolate. He will receive statutory sick pay on top of holiday pay he accrued while on furlough. His absence will have little effect on service but I have a sinking feeling about what is to come... The Hideout survived the pandemic but will it survive the pingdemic?

Monday, June 28, AM: My fears are confirmed when two more front-of-house staff are pinged. Given that ten employees are usually on shift at any one time, our team is reduced by a fifth. Finding new recruits isn’t easy. The pandemic has drained the economy of hospitality workers, who got fed up waiting for restaurants and bars to reopen. One of our chefs left to work as a delivery driver. A team leader got a supermarket job. We have been looking for new staff since April but there are no quick fixes that can resolve today’s crisis.

Monday, June 28, PM: Jordan and I discuss what to do. We don’t have enough employees to cover every shift for the next six days. It is heartbreaking to think we might have to close again. We decide to cut our opening hours instead. Around 60pc of our takings are made during the evening shift, so breakfast and lunch is sacrificed for dinner. We agree that for the next six days The Hideout will open from 4pm, with normal service resuming on Monday, July 5.

A message to self-isolate displayed on the NHS coronavirus contact tracing app

Tuesday, June 29: The Hideout’s Facebook account is used to let customers know of our change in opening hours. A note is also pinned on the cafe’s front door. But as not everyone has seen the Facebook post, several people only find out we are closed when they turn up. We also have dozens of bookings that can no longer go ahead, so we call each customer to tell them what has happened. Everyone seems supportive but I’m worried what customers will think.

Sunday, July 4: We have lost about £8,000 in takings from being on reduced hours but I’m really grateful for all the support our staff have shown us. Three have come in on their days off to help cover shifts. This afternoon we return to Facebook to let customers know we will open at 8am tomorrow. It should be a happy moment but I go to sleep wondering whether another employee will have been pinged by the time I wake up.

Thursday, July 15: We were free of the pings for almost two weeks but I knew our luck wouldn’t last. Jordan receives two more calls from staff. One of them is a chef and we need at least two in the kitchen at any one time. We frantically rearrange the rota — but this time we can’t get away with reduced hours alone and will have to close for two full days. As Monday and Tuesday are our least profitable days, they are the obvious choice. But we still ended up losing £5,500 as a result.

We have dozens of bookings that can no longer go ahead, so we call each customer to tell them what has happened. Everyone seems supportive but I’m worried what customers will think

Tuesday, August 3: FIingers crossed, we haven’t been hit by any further pings. We have also managed to recruit three more employees. But I am living in fear that the pingdemic could force us to close again at any moment. On Friday we had our first positive case — a waitress who had been on leave for a week beforehand.

As she she had been off for several days by the time she developed mild symptoms, no other Hideout employees have had to self-isolate. None of our four pinged staff members ended up testing positive for the virus. I welcome the decision to reduce the five-day window in which contacts are traced to two — it’s a start. However, if this will only cut the number of people being pinged by tens of thousands, then more needs to be done.

Ministers have said that from August 16, anyone pinged by the app will no longer have to self-isolate if they are fully vaccinated. But why wait so long? My staff are all young and many are still waiting for their second jab. But even if they are pinged, surely if someone can prove they don’t have the virus through daily testing, they shouldn’t have to stay at home? One person in every five in the industry was self-isolating last week — that’s the impact this is having on our sector.

I’m very grateful for the help we have had, especially from Scarborough Borough Council, which was so quick to pay out our £10,000 small business grant at the beginning of the pandemic. And I know how lucky we are not to have been seriously ill with the virus, when so many others have been in hospital and died. But even though our turnover was £350,000 last year, we are yet to break even. And while the pingdemic rages, we don’t stand a chance of making up our losses.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@With electric cars growing in popularity, many may be thinking about owning one and how they can charge it quickly at home.

An electric vehicle is said to be 47 per cent cheaper a year to run than a petrol equivalent, according to Compare the Market and they now make up around one in ten new car sales.

However, the upfront price of electric cars, cost of charger installation and the perceived difficulty associated with fitting one at home are significant speed bumps for many drivers considering the switch.

To help drivers that are considering getting an electric car and installing a charger, This is Money, with the help of industry experts, has answered the most common questions - from how much installation really is to the best tariffs currently available.

Many people are worried about the cost of getting an electric charger installed at home

What sort of charger will I need?

It is possible for motorists to charge their electric vehicle at home using a standard three-pin plug with a cable and a wall-mounted home-charging point.

However, this method is not recommended as it can take more than 12 hours to fully charge a car.

Dan Hutson, head of motor at Compare the Market, said: 'If you want fast charging from home, you'll need more specialist wiring and equipment, with a dedicated charger that provides either 3.6kW, 7kW or 22kW power output.'

Installing this equipment typically requires homes to have dedicated off-street parking and a Wi-Fi connection.

Most people choose to install a straightforward 7kW home charger as this will charge your car three times faster than a three-pin plug.

What is the cheapest way to get a charger installed?

Those who are looking to get an electric vehicle charger fitted should see if they could benefit from the Government's Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme.

This provides grant funding of up to 75 per cent towards the cost of installing electric vehicle charge points at domestic properties across the UK.

A grant cap is set at £350, including VAT, per installation with the main requirement being that a person owns, leases, or has ordered a qualifying vehicle and has dedicated off-street parking at their property.

Consumers in Scotland, can get up to an additional £300 grant, depending on where in the country they live.

Drivers may apply for two charge points at the same property if they have two qualifying vehicles.

To benefit from the grant, the customer must first choose an installer to fit their charge point with the installer checking the household qualifies before applying on the customer's behalf.

The installer will then bill the customer for the price of the installation minus the grant amount they have applied for.

Installers must be authorised by the Office of Zero Emission Vehicles before they are allowed to fit any of the charging equipment and the vehicle must be listed on the Government's website to be eligible.

EDF, which is partnered with electric car charging firm Pod Point, said a 7kW Pod Point Solo Smart Charger costs from £549 including standard installation, including the OZEV grant of £350.

Mark Bennett, energy expert at Energy Helpline said: 'Home charging points on average cost around £800 to install.

'It's unwise to attempt to fit your own home charge point unless you are a trained electrician and many of the charging points lose their warranties if not installed by a professional.

'Depending on the type of charger, the average cost of getting someone to install your charging point is around £375 for 3kW charger and £625 for a 7kW charger.

'In total this could set you back almost £850, once you factor in your grant, so grab a quote from a local electrician before making the decision to install a home charging point.'

There needs to be more charging points as it is currently a 'postcode lottery', experts say

What are the best tariffs currently available?

There are now several tariffs now available for electric vehicles with experts encouraging households that have a home charge point to find a competitively priced electricity tariff.

This not only makes running an electric car much easier but also cheaper and greener as it uses excess renewable energy when demand is low overnight.

However, it is difficult to work out the exact annual cost of an EV tariff, as most of them charge different amounts for day and night, and the average consumption figures don’t give a time of day breakdown.

Bennett said: 'Depending on your household usage, the best tariffs for households with electrical vehicles are likely to be ones which offer a cheaper energy rate late at night, when most people will be charging their electric vehicles.

'These tariffs require a special electricity meter known as an Economy 7 meter.'

One of the latest tariffs comes from the RAC and British Gas who have partnered to give customers a smart 7kW home charge point installed by a British Gas engineer.

They also give customers access to a home electricity tariff especially designed to make overnight electric car charging cheaper than with a conventional tariff.

The RAC-e Recharge Electric Car Tariff could saves customers money, with charging between 12am to 5am costing just 6p per kWh which could save users up to £300 on a home electric bill.

However, to take advantage of the RAC-e Tariff, which has no exit fee, customers will need to have a British Gas electric smart meter installed so their off-peak charging can be tracked.

Other firms that offer EV deals include Octopus on its Agile tariff, EDF on its GoElectric rates, Good Energy on its Good Energy Green Driver 7 deal and Ovo on its Ovo Drive tariff.

All give different prices for peak and off-peak rates with the off-peak prices up to a quarter cheaper.

Customers are encouraged to compare prices and deals for themselves to see which would suit them best.

Call for more charge points to be installed Research from Go Compare found that, of those who are put off buying an electric vehicle, half said they wouldn't choose an electric vehicle until there is a better network of charging points. This is one of the key issues associated with electric vehicles at present with the problem highlighted recently with experts calling for there to be a national network of electric vehicle charge points in place ahead of the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The Competition and Market Authority said access to the points can be a 'postcode lottery' with the number of total public charge points per head in Yorkshire and the Humber at a quarter of those in London. It added it is concerned about the choice and availability of charge points at motorway service stations, where competition is limited as well as the roll-out of on-street charging by Local Authorities which it says is too slow. There is also the risk of rural areas being left behind with too few charge points due to lack of investment. Sue Davies, Which? head of consumer protection policy, said: 'The UK's electric car charging network is confusing, disjointed and in dire need of reform to make it a viable option for all, especially those who do not have access to a private charger. 'To ensure electric cars are a choice for most consumers, the Government should take these recommendations seriously and take the necessary steps to make the public charging network larger, simpler and more accessible than it is today.'

How much work is it to have a charger fitted?

It typically takes a trained electrician between two and four hours to install a home charge point.

However, this will be depending on your home, where you want the charging point and the charger you're looking to get installed.

How do you know if your driveway is suitable for a charger?

Experts say before deciding on installing a charging point, it is worth speaking to an electrician and getting them to come out to scope the work that needs to be done.

A driveway isn't necessarily required but given the charging point can't be moved once built, you'll need to be able to access the charging point if you live by the side of a road.

If renting, customers would need to have permission from their landlord to have a home charge point installed.

Customers also need to consider where they want it installed in relation to the property or fuse board as the standard installation is for 15 metres of cable, and if any ground works are needed this could increase the cost of install.

Is it possible to rent out the charger to neighbours?

It is possible to rent out to neighbours and also others thanks to a number of parking schemes, such as Just Park, which you can join, that allow you to rent it out to anyone, whenever you want.

Customers on electric vehicle tariffs will likely be asked to have a smart meter installed

What else would someone have to think of before fitting a charger to their home?

Most EV tariffs require you to have an Economy 7 meter. These electricity meters give you a cheaper rate during the evening, when most people are likely to be using their electricity, and a more expensive one during the day.

It is worth noting the daytime price can be quite expensive on these tariffs and any savings you make from the cheaper evening rate is lost if you use a lot of electricity during the day.

Especially if you aren't charging your car to make the most of the cheaper night-time tariff.

Is it generally worth the money to install one?

Whether it is worth installing depends on individual circumstances, experts say.

Bennett of Energy Helpline said: 'For some people installing a home charge point, absolutely makes sense.

'If you regularly use your electric vehicle, are inclined to rent it out or have multiple electric cars, then getting a home charging point is probably beneficial, as charging your car at public charging points can be inconvenient and some will charge you.

'Before starting out on the improvement to your home, do your research and make sure it will benefit you in the long run.'

A spokesperson for the Energy Saving Trust added: 'Charging an electric vehicle at home is generally much cheaper than using a public charge point.

'In addition, there is the convenience of charging when your vehicle is likely to be unused for long lengths of time, such as overnight.

'Although it is possible to charge your vehicle using a standard three pin plug, this is strongly discouraged as it will take a long time to fill up the battery and household sockets are not designed for this high level of constant usage.

'A charge point at home will be separately fused and compliant with the relevant safety legislation.'

However, for those who have access to local charging points nearby, it may be that sticking with that option would be easier and cheaper.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Borrowers of beleaguered subprime lender Amigo Loans have hit back after it sent them a survey asking them why they voted against its rescue plan.

Britain's largest guarantor loan provider had its proposed cost-cutting scheme of arrangement rejected by the High Court last month.

The judge ruled it was unfair and that past and present borrowers, who could have been compensated just 5 per cent of what they were owed for mis-sold loans, were not properly informed about the proposals or any alternatives to them.

There are fears Amigo Loans could be on the brink after its proposed rescue plan was rejected by the High Court. It had said such a rejection could tip it into insolvency

He sent the company back to the drawing board, after the Financial Conduct Authority said it believed 'a fairer scheme' was possible, despite the company saying the scheme's failure would likely tip it into administration.

The just under 4,000 borrowers who voted against the scheme were sent emails on Wednesday morning from Amigo's chief executive Gary Jennison asking them several questions, including why they voted against the scheme.

Similar emails asking for feedback had been sent to the 74,866 creditors who voted in favour, as well as those who didn't vote at all.

Among the options provided to 'no' voters were 'I did not believe it would give customers the best outcome for any compensation claims', 'I did not understand it' and 'I wanted Amigo to go into administration.'

Another of the questions was: 'How do you feel about the objection of the court and the consequences of this? (Such as a further delay to receiving any compensation for customers who have a valid claim)'

Under the proposed rescue plan, Amigo was set to earmark a potential £35million pot to pay back borrowers mis-sold unaffordable loans.

There were concerns borrowers could receive as little as 5 per cent of what they were due.

The Financial Ombudsman has received about 12,000 complaints from Amigo customers, but resolved only a fraction at about 1,000. Nine in 10 of the complaints resolved were upheld by the Financial Ombudsman.

Amigo claims, however, that the uphold rate for all complaints to the FOS is lower at around four in 10.

A 31 March tweet announcing voting on the scheme had been opened featured the tagline: 'Vote FOR Your Money'.

The judge in the High Court case said 'the creditors lacked the necessary information or experience to enable them properly to appreciate the alternative options reasonably available to them'.

The email to those who voted no added: 'We previously said that without the scheme, we would likely go into insolvency.

'This means there would be no cash compensation available for customers who were mis-sold an Amigo loan. This situation is still a very real possibility.'

Amigo was criticised by regulators and then the High Court for failing to properly outline its rescue plan to borrowers

In his judgment, Mr Justice Miles effectively accused the lender of fearmongering over this suggestion, stating: 'It is unlikely that the directors would put the group straight into administration and destroy the substantial surplus value of the enterprise.

'There is nothing in the evidence to suggest any imminent cashflow event that would force Amigo into insolvency.'

The subprime lender's share price has crashed 72 per cent in the last month, ever since the FCA weighed in on 10 May to announce it would oppose the scheme in court.

They crashed from 18.6p on 24 May to just 8.3p on the day the scheme was rejected a fortnight ago.

One borrower, who voted in favour of the scheme, wrote on the blog Debt Camel, where details of the email surfaced, it was 'shocking that Amigo seem to be targeting people who voted no to the scheme.'

Another said: 'I feel they have singled out everyone that voted against the scheme.'

A third added: 'The questions are farcical and still looking to shift blame, I have been scathing in my response.'

Sara Williams, a debt adviser who runs Debt Camel, said: 'The FCA said Amigo had not accurately described their situation and the proposed scheme to customers.

'It is very disappointing that once again Amigo is now talking to customers without properly explaining things.

'I am not sure what the point is of asking customers what they think of the situation when those customers have not been properly informed about it in the first place.

Britain's city regulator said Amigo's proposed rescue scheme was unfair to borrowers who would have had the value of their compensation massively watered down

'These emails asking customers who voted for their thoughts have again emphasised that there would be no cash payouts in insolvency, but Amigo fails to mention that the 130,000 borrowers with a current loan would be able to get their balances reduced or cleared in insolvency if an affordability claim is upheld, so they would gain little or nothing from a scheme.'

Amigo told the London Stock Exchange this morning it was continuing to consider all options and was in talks with the FCA 'to identify an appropriate way forward', including a more generous scheme for borrowers.

John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said the uncertainty over Amigo's future 'could roll on for some time yet.'

An Amigo spokesperson told This is Money: 'We have reached out to customers who voted both for and against the scheme to update them on what is going on and at the same time gather their views and inform our thinking as we determine our next steps.

'We have always had an ongoing dialogue with our customers and this is not the first time we have sought to survey their views.

'We want to hear from all of our customers and will also be reaching out to a sample of those who did not vote in the coming days, to gain a greater understanding of their reasoning.'

Coming shortly before the Scottish independence referendum of 2014, it was the subtlest of hints as to how the Queen felt about the matter.

The voters, she said, should 'think very carefully about the future'.

Now her son appears to have made his own, equally subtle plea for unity. New aerial photographs of Dumfries House in Scotland show that Prince Charles has used an elaborate planting scheme to portray the Union Flag in the carefully cultivated vegetable beds.

It is hard to tell from ground level, of course, but from above, the distinctive pattern of the national flag is unmistakable.

The Prince helped to save Dumfries House for the nation 14 years ago, renovating the building and grounds and creating a new cultural project. Open to visitors, the centre offers a range of courses, many in traditional skills, with an emphasis on sustainability. It has even been credited with reviving the local economy.

The images, taken with permission for The Mail on Sunday, show for the first time the vast scale of Charles's now-completed project on the 2,000-acre estate.

While Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle might project the scale and grandeur of the Monarchy, the 18th Century Dumfries House estate, 40 miles south of Glasgow, provides a far better insight into the heir to the throne and his interests.

What was once a muddy bog has been transformed into an arboretum with native trees, and an old laundry has become a school for artists. There is an organic farm, which is home to rare-breed animals, and a schoolroom which teaches children about growing fruit and vegetables in the gardens.

The Prince himself designed the Belvedere (summer house) – complete with gargoyles – after sketching it out on a napkin.

Elsewhere in the grounds, a wellness centre, dubbed 'the Royal NHS', provides programmes and homeopathy for patients referred there by their GP.

Workshops and a hospitality centre run training courses for young people. Local designers enrolled in the fashion programme have even had their collections sold on the upmarket designer website, Net-a-Porter.

Funds from the foundation have partly been used to renovate a nearby outdoor swimming pool.

The Royal Family doesn't do Disneyland, but if it did, it might look something like this.

Yet there is another big surprise in store – for some visitors, at least. On a visit to Dumfries House this summer, Charles bumped into a mother and her daughter, who was wearing a slogan T-shirt emblazoned with the initials 'VIP'.

'Hello! How nice to meet a VIP!' he quipped. The girl was stunned to find herself face-to-face with the Prince in his walking gear, while her mother burst into laughter.

Charles's staff have plenty of anecdotes like this. On another occasion he was offered an ice cream by a man visiting the playground with his children.

The response? A source reveals: 'He said, 'That's very kind, but why don't you buy one for the children instead?' '

Designed by Scottish architects the Adam brothers, the house was built 250 years ago as a retirement home for William Crichton-Dalrymple, the 5th Earl of Dumfries. When his wife died without giving him an heir, he hoped to attract a new bride. But his second marriage failed and the house stood empty and eventually passed to a cousin

At Dumfries House, the heir to the throne is not known as the Prince of Wales or even by his Scottish title, the Duke of Rothesay.

'Here, we refer to him as The Boss,' said one member of staff, before adding: 'Not to be confused with Bruce Springsteen, of course.'

Not that the American singer would be at a loss as to where to perform – in 2018, Charles was granted permission to build a wedding venue on the site.

Designed by Scottish architects the Adam brothers, the house was built 250 years ago as a retirement home for William Crichton-Dalrymple, the 5th Earl of Dumfries. When his wife died without giving him an heir, he hoped to attract a new bride.

But his second marriage failed and the house stood empty and eventually passed to a cousin. Its last known occupant, the elderly dowager Marchioness of Bute, is said to have left cigarette burns in a silk-upholstered Chippendale chair from smoking while watching horse racing on television.

When it was put up for sale in 2007 by her relative Johnny Dumfries, a former Formula 1 racing driver, with the antique furniture destined for an auction house, the Prince of Wales led a consortium to save it. In a dramatic deal finalised at the 11th hour, lorries taking the Chippendale furniture to auction were stopped on the motorway and turned around. Charles had secured a £20million loan from Barclays to raise a total of £45 million to buy the estate and its contents.

Dumfries House is also likely to play a role in hosting VIPs during the COP26 climate conference in November, when Charles will address world leaders during the two-week summit taking place in Glasgow

How much has been spent restoring the house and grounds? The foundation won't say, but a member of staff estimates 'at least another £45million' has been spent.

Simon Sadinsky, executive director of The Prince's Foundation, said: 'It's hard to believe it's been 14 years since Dumfries House was saved for the nation. It now acts as a catalyst for regeneration of the area. We welcome hundreds of pupils and students to the estate each month for a range of hands-on learning experiences, including heritage crafts, food, farming, hospitality and horticulture, which all champion sustainable practices, increase self-confidence and employability, and help preserve heritage skills which are at risk of being lost.'

The fertility programme at Dumfries House has proved a success, with two babies born as a result of the treatment on offer.

Couples unable to afford costly private treatment or who might be waiting for NHS appointments can put themselves forward for the six-week course, which includes one-to-one sessions with a gynaecologist, nutrition advice, and developing a 'fertility mindset'.

Dumfries House is also likely to play a role in hosting VIPs during the COP26 climate conference in November, when Charles will address world leaders during the two-week summit taking place in Glasgow.

Indeed, Charles and Camilla are spending an increasing amount of time in Scotland. He is often seen walking around the grounds, talking to the head gardener.

A Palace source said: 'The Prince walks the walk and is prepared to get his hands dirty. I've seen him picking up rubbish as he goes around the grounds. It's about the education centre teaching children how not to waste food, the apprenticeships training people to work in hospitality. The point is, it's as much about the people as it is about the building.

'That's what matters to the Prince – how does Dumfries House change and help the local community?'

Nearly 15 years on, not only is the building repaired but the estate is open to visitors, while the Lodge, an upmarket hotel, is up and running on the site. All proceeds go back to the foundation.

The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall have been frequent visitors in recent years, personally looking in on the progress.

And while there are only two residents who get the Royal treatment at Dumfries House, they aren't the two you might think.

'Meet Hilda and Gilda,' says a gardener, pointing to two female rare-breed pigs at the farm.

'They have a home for life, here. We treat them like queens.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Kirstie Alley has lambasted new guidelines from a worldwide organisation of doctors that encourages the use of 'gender-inclusive language' such as 'chestfeeding,' 'parent's milk' and 'human milk feeding'.

In a series of tweets on Sunday, the 70-year-old actress claimed the terms were 'degrading and nullifying of women and their abilities'.

She also insisted that she was not speaking from a 'political' standpoint but that she deemed the terminology 'insanity'.

'Gender-inclusive' language has been promoted by various hospitals to accommodate transgender men, who were born female but identify as male, and non-binary people who do not classify themselves as either gender.

'I'm tired of the degrading of women': Kirstie Alley slammed 'insane nullifying' of women's abilities in a row over the gender neutral term 'chestfeeding'

Kirstie began her lengthy Twitter tirade by posting: 'BREAST-FEEDING IS what WOMEN do. Women also bottle feed. Men bottle feed too.

'We do not have to buckle to the insanity of the minuscule minority of lunatics who make us feel guilty for not sharing their insanity. 'Chest feeding?' 'human milk feeding?' WTF STOP IT!!!'

Kirstie then shared a response from a follower who argued, 'Why do you care what other people do? Why are republicans always so concerned with what everyone is doing? They're always up in everyone's business', to which Kirstie responded, 'Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah'.

Clarifying her points, Kirstie continued: 'I'm a little tired of the degrading and nullifying of women and their abilities. Breastfeeding is one of our abilities.

'It's a beautiful and important ability. Knock off the nullifying of women fir the sake of lunatics. Equal rights does not equal insanity.

'We all have opinions. Probably the main reason social media is so popular. Especially on our own sites. I guess it's also inviting other opinions of our opinions but I don't feel obligated to be 'sweet' when people are nasty to me about my own site opinions. BlAh blAh blAh.

'It's our personal responsibility to agree or disagree with concepts. My only point here today is don't let insanity force you to pretend like you agree with the insanity. It's part of the insanity to shame you into agreement.'

Insane: Kirstie insisted that she was not speaking from a 'political' standpoint but that she deemed the terminology 'insanity'

Kirstie, a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, went on to state that her views have been shared by both republican and democrat friends.

She wrote: 'My views of this BS are not political. I have plenty of friends from both political persuasions who SHARE the view of the INSANITIES being shoved down our throats by pervs trying to degrade our society. Don't be afraid to disagree with people who seek to pervert workable morals.'

Kirstie - who boasts 1.5 million Twitter followers - then shared a response from a follower that read: 'No one asked you to speak for cis women's breasts or bodies in general. This is about feeding babies, something that isn't even a concern of yours or your titties.'

The Cheers star fired back: 'I don't need to speak for 'cis' women. I am a woman and feel comfortable just calling myself a woman and having a woman's point of view. I don't need to be ASKED to speak Deb. We handled that pretty well in 1920.'

Speaking out: In a series of tweets on Sunday, the 70-year-old actress claimed the terms were 'degrading and nullifying of women and their abilities'

Kirstie concluded: 'For the record I don't care what people call themselves or categorize their identity. Just leave mine alone. I'm happy with woman, mother, actress, sister, daughter, grandma and gurley to name most of my handles.'

Kirstie's comments come after the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine urged the use of 'gender-inclusive language' such as 'chestfeeding,' 'parent's milk' and 'human milk feeding' in new guidelines.

Guidelines published on July 29 read: 'ABM recognizes that not all people who give birth and lactate identify as female, and that some of these individuals identify as neither female nor male.'

The document was co-authored by eight doctors, with contributor Dr. Laura Kair of the UC Davis Children's Hospital, releasing an accompanying a statement, in which she said 'language has power.'

The statement read: 'The language that we use should be as inclusive as possible when discussing infant feeding. When working with patients it is best to ask them their affirmed terminology.

'When communicating medical research, language should accurately reflect the population studied so as not to mask research needs.'

Shared views: Kirstie, a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, went on to state that her views have been shared by both republican and democrat friends

Kirstie's comments come after a slew of Hollywood stars spoke out about concerns over the suppression of speech surrounding the trans debate.

Last year, JK Rowling was subjected to bitter attacks from transgender activists following the publication of her latest novel, Troubled Blood.

The novel was published under Rowling's pseudonym Robert Galbraith and features a 'transvestite serial killer', which sparked furious backlash online a day before the book's release on September 15.

A collection of over 50 actors, writers, playwrights, journalists joined together to pen a letter in response to 'hate speech' directed against the author.

Signatories of the letter include Booker winner Ian McEwan, actor Griff Rhys Jones, actress Frances Barber and playwright Sir Tom Stoppard.

It was was triggered in response to the hashtag #RIPJKRowling trending at number one on Twitter and said Rowling was a victim of 'an insidious, authoritarian and misogynistic trend in social media'.

The letter wrote the hashtag declaring her dead on social media was 'just the latest example of hate speech directed against her'.

Following her ordeal, JK called for an end to the 'climate of fear' around the trans debate after being sent 'heart-breaking' letters from women who had irreversible gender reassignment surgery.

The Harry Potter author, 56, said she 'had a huge postbag' with hundreds of letters following her comments over the summer, adding that 90 per cent of them were in support of her stance.

Speaking out: Kirstie's comments come after a slew of stars spoke out about concerns over the suppression of speech surrounding the trans debate after there were calls to 'cancel' JK Rowling over her stance

She told Good Housekeeping magazine: 'Many women are concerned about the challenges to their fundamental rights posed by certain aspects of gender identity ideology.'

JK called for 'a more nuanced conversation' about the 'huge increase' in the number of girls and young women seeking to transition.

She added: 'I've had a huge postbag since speaking up on this issue and more than 90 per cent of the letters and emails have been supportive.

'My correspondence have included medical staff, social workers, prison workers, workers in women's refuges and members of the LGBT community, including trans people.'

She said people were 'afraid to speak up' and called for a 'more nuanced conversation' around women's rights.

Controversial: In June, JK sparked controversy when she questioned the use of the phrase 'people who menstruate' instead of the word 'woman'

It came after JK sparked controversy when she questioned the use of the phrase 'people who menstruate' instead of the word 'woman' and went on to insist that the concept of sex is real.

Reacting to an article, she tweeted to her 14.5m followers: 'I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?'

Her stance led to a massive backlash with criticism coming from fans and Harry Potter stars including Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Eddie Redmayne.

The 31-year-old went on to tell her fans she couldn't cope with the unpacking of all her boxes, which she still has stacked up in each room and a sickness bug left her weak and unable to look after her children properly all weekend.

The Coronation Street star's confession came as she disclosed that she had privately suffered from Hyperemesis gravidarum during all three of her pregnancies.

Woeful: The Coronation Street star's revelation came as she told fans she'd been secretly suffering from Hyperemesis gravidarum during her last pregnancy

Helen touched her face and stroked her hair and looked to be on the verge of tears as she revealed on Instagram: 'I'm trying to get on top of the house. I've actually moved house recently which is exciting but it has been stressful.

'I haven't shared it on my social media. I don't know,' she continued.

'It might sound really silly to a lot of people but sometimes sharing some things on Instagram makes me feel a bit anxious.

'Anyway we've been moving house the last few weeks really and I'm not going to lie. I do feel a bit overwhelmed.

'Every single room is like towers of boxes and I can't find anything and organisation is not my strong point.

Stressed: The 31-year-old also said she can't cope with all the unpacking of boxes, which she still has stacked up in each room

Downcast: Helen touched her face and stroked her hair anxiously and looked in the verge of tears

'So yeah any tips on organisation or when you've moved house on how to basically just get it together. I feel like I just don't even know where to start really.'

Helen shares daughters Delilah, three, Charlie, four months, and Matilda, six, with footballer fiancé Scott Sinclair, 32, and earlier told viewers she'd 'had a horrible sickness bug all weekend', which left her struggling to look after her children.

'Scott's been away all weekend with football and my mum's been away. Looking after three young children with the bug has been hard,' she said.

'Girls have argued the whole time and Charlie has wanted to be held all the time. Not being a misery but showing a bit of reality.'

Helen also told her followers that she had suffered from the HG illness - Hyperemesis gravidarum - during all three of her pregnancies.

Glum: Helen, who is engaged to footballer Scott Sinclair, 32, told of her moving angst after she had earlier told her viewers she'd 'had a horrible sickness bug all weekend'

Symptoms include severe nausea, weight loss, vomiting and dehydration due to a rise in hormone levels.

She said: 'I had HG in all three pregnancies and when I have a sickness bug it does bring it all back. HG is not morning sickness and it's not something you can just get on with.

The former I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here campmate advised fans that telling someone with HG to eat a ginger biscuit doesn't help.

'I get a lot of direct messages from other women on HG. It's a comfort to know you're not just on your own.'

'For me it lasted around three months. Medication worked with Delilah. Nothing worked with Charlie.

Tough time: She said, 'I had HG in all three pregnancies and when I have a sickness bug it does bring it all back' (pictured with son Charlie and fiancé Scott)

'The worst was 100-per-cent not being able to look after the girls. What worked for me was lots of rest, lots of help with children.'

'I moved in with my mum for three months as Scott had football. Even though you can't face it eating little and often.

'Sipping lemonade worked for me. Medication worked with Delilah. I was ill with girls and a boy. The HG got stronger though in each pregnancy.

'Your babies are always so worth it and more. Just thought I'd share as I do have a lot of women messaging me about it and you do feel very on your own when you go through it.'

Stacey replied: 'I'll probably come back after Christmas I reckon. I've never had a proper maternity leave.'

The former X Factor star, who is expecting her first daughter with Joe, 39, did promise her castmates that she would make sure to bring her little girl into the studio beforehand.

When asked by Linda: 'You've got to come back before with the baby,' Stacey replied: 'Oh god as soon as she's born.'

Stacey said: 'I'll probably come back after Christmas I reckon. I've never had a proper maternity leave'

Kaye, 58, then added: 'It will be nice for you to have a period of time where you can just concentrate on the family.'

During the impromptu baby shower, Stacey was presented with a variety of gifts and snacks - including her go-to pregnancy craving, raw cauliflower with mango chutney, mayonnaise and curry powder - and donned both a sash and tiara.

Stacey also explained that she is 'mindful' of every moment in her fourth pregnancy as it's likely this will be the 'last time' she has a child.

Stacey and Joe - who have been together since 2015 and became engaged on Christmas Eve - are set to tie the knot next July after postponing their wedding due to the pandemic.

She and Joe share two-year-old son Rex, while Stacey also has Zachary, 13, and nine-year-old Leighton from previous relationships.

Elsewhere, Stacey has been putting her DIY skills to the test since moving into her new dream home with her blossoming family, and on Wednesday gave fans a peek of her unborn daughter's new nursery.

Emotional, Stacey wrote: 'I could honestly cry, it's such lovely flooring. And just makes it feel so much bigger and cleaner in here... I went for a white herringbone laminate so I can mop it and keep it nice and clean in here. I just love it.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Some of the UK's biggest companies have announced share buyback programmes over the past few months as the economy emerges from the worst of the pandemic.

London-listed firms have launched share buybacks with a value of some £14billion so far this year, including 14 FTSE 100 firms, according to figures from AJ Bell.

It's a significant turnaround from 2020, when share buybacks with a value of more than £10billion were scrapped as companies grappled with the effects of the pandemic. Just £1.6billion were approved and carried out from March to December.

'Investors must now decide whether this [turnaround] is a sign that corporate confidence is flooding back, and the good times are about to roll once more; or whether boardrooms are letting down their guard too quickly in the wake of the pandemic and leaving their firms open to the next unexpected shock, whatever it might be,' Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell says.

Natwest recently announced plans to buy back £750million worth of shares after returning to profit

What is a share buyback?

When companies build up a lot of excess cash they can either invest it in something, keep it for a rainy day or hand it back to shareholders.

If they opt to hand it back to investors, they can either hand it over as a dividend or by buying back the company's shares from investors.

Once the shares are repurchased they are considered cancelled but can be kept for redistribution in the future.

Why do companies do it?

There are a number of reasons companies choose to buy back shares. The most common reason companies buy back shares is because they think their stock is undervalued and they want to increase demand.

'Companies typically see buybacks as a means of giving back to investors, driving up the share price rather than paying out excess cash in the form of dividends,' Joshua Mahony, senior analyst at IG says.

'Companies typically opt to buy back shares as a means of raising their market valuation, with the lower number of shares helping to improve financial metrics such as earnings per share,' he adds.

To calculate earnings per share (EPS), the company's net income is divided by the number of shares in issue.

The EPS will naturally go up if a company reduces the number of shares. For example, if a company reports net income of $10million and there are 100,000 shares, the EPS is $100.

If the company then repurchases 10,000 of these shares, its EPS increases to $111.11 without any actual increase in earnings.

Whilst there are benefits associated with a buyback programme, if a firm has to facilitate the programme with a debt instrument it could suffer from credit risk.

Why are companies buying shares back now?

In the past week alone, Natwest, Shell and BP have announced bumper buyback programmes after posting soaring profits.

Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments predicts it is 'just getting started, particularly given the excess cash reserves many companies have on their balance sheets as a result of the pandemic-induced cautiousness which led many firms to hold onto cash for security'.

'During the pandemic, when the outcome was largely unknown, many firms held onto excess cash as a cushion for potential downside risk.

'Now, as the world begins to recover, firms are looking to deploy this cash in the form of buyback programmes as well as capital spending.'

What should shareholders look out for?

Share repurchasing tends to be welcomed by investors as it means they're handed cash, but there are some drawbacks.

'While investors will almost always view a share buyback as a positive, companies will sometimes utilise them as a means to manipulate shareholding amounts and avoid other shareholders from taking a controlling stake,' Mahony said.

Mould adds there may be some who see this 'rapid return to corporate largesse as a worrying sign, and one that reflects the return of animal spirits and frothy, bull-market conditions within equity markets.'

History shows companies tend to buy stock back during bull markets - when shares are getting more expensive - rather than in bear ones, when shares are getting cheaper.

'Shareholders therefore need to assess the current buyback crop on a case-by-case basis, looking at how the buybacks are to be funded, the strength of the firms' cashflows and balance sheet and the strategy behind such plans,' Mould says.

'Investors must therefore look at how a company buys back its stock.'

'If it does so in a disciplined manner, clearly setting a maximum price that it is prepared to pay (and explaining why) then the buyback could help to create shareholder value through the efficient deployment of cash.'

'But if a company buys shares at any price – something that could get a professional fund manager the sack for poor performance and do damage to any private investor's portfolio, since the price and valuation paid for a stock are the ultimate arbiter of the long-term return they make from an investment – then its buyback programme should be treated with scepticism.

'Such indiscipline would raise suspicions that management is simply trying to massage the share price or earnings targets or both, especially in managers are using cheap debt as a source of funding rather than internally generated cash.'

Why would investors sell their shares in a buyback?

Shareholders can either opt to sell their shares back to the company in exchange for a payout or they can hold onto the shares. For shareholders the benefit is that the offer is usually made at a premium to the market price to make it attractive.

However if they opt to keep the shares they will hold a larger percentage of the company than they did before the buyback because the number of shares in the company declines but the personal shareholding does not.

'A company will typically buy back shares over a period of time, going into the market just like any other investor to purchase shares from those investors looking to relinquish their holdings,' Mahony said.

'From a seller's perspective, this would provide greater liquidity for when they do opt to exit their position. However, the company will not force people to sell up if it is not their plan to do so.'

Another less common method comes with the use of a tender offer, which sees shareholders state a price at which they would be willing to sell their shares.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Households have been hungry for takeaways during the pandemic, as lockdowns have forced us all to stay indoors.

But as restrictions start to lift in many western countries, a key question is whether this insatiable appetite will keep on growing – or shrink again as economies reopen.

That will be on the minds of investors as they pore over Just Eat Takeaway.com's half-year results on Tuesday.

The firm is Britain's biggest food delivery giant, but is jostling for dominance with rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats.

And this week, results from Deliveroo seemed to show that the pandemic takeaways boom continued in the first half of this year.

But in an ominous sign for the sector, the firm warned that the recent rapid growth was expected to 'moderate' in the second half of 2021.

Figures also showed the company's pace of sales expansion had already slowed from the first to second quarters.

In recent years, Just Eat has sought to bolster takeaway sales from independent restaurants by also partnering with bigger brands such as McDonald's and KFC.

Analysts will be on the look out for any clues as to Just Eat's future intentions, as well as for signs about how much it thinks pandemic trends will persist.

They expect the firm to post full-year revenues of £3.7billion in 2021 – compared to £2billion a year previously – so will also be watching for signs this is still on track.

On Friday Just Eat shares rose 1.3 per cent, or 79p, to 6180p.

Holiday: The former Love Islander took to her Instagram story to share the snap, as she continues her family vacation with Santiago and her parents

Her seven-month-old looked adorable as he matched his mum in a red and white tank top and white shorts.

Santiago's father Sammy Kimmence was sent to prison last month for scamming two pensioners out of £34,000.

But Dani appears to have brushed this aside to enjoy the sun-soaked trip with her actor dad Danny and mother Joanne.

Shame: Santiago's father Sammy Kimmence was sent to prison last month for scamming two pensioners out of £34,000

Danny branded his eldest daughter a 'chav' as they celebrated her birthday last week.

Yet EastEnders actor, 44, proved he wasn't giving his daughter an easy ride amid her heartbreak, as he playfully mocked her in his birthday tribute on Sunday.

'Happy Birthday to my day one,' the doting dad began. 'Can’t believe I’ve got a 25 year old chav….me and you against the world baby….

'We thrive when we face adversity…there is no word in that f***ing dictionary to explain how much I love you. Thank you for making me a father. ❤️❤️ [sic]'

Sisterly love: The Love Island star's lookalike sister Sunnie (left), 14, paid tribute to Dani (right) on her big day

The milestone day comes after Dani split from boyfriend Sammy last month when he was slapped with a three year prison sentence.

Sammy, 25, was found guilty of £34k worth of fraud and lied to Dani about his crimes.

He duped Peter Martin, 91, and Peter Haynes, 81, by persuading the vulnerable pensioners to let him to invest their money for them and then splashed out on expensive restaurants, hotels and clothes.

His victims had been clients of Sammy when he worked as Senior Trader at Equine Global Sports Limited, a company which subsequently went into liquidation.

The company received money from customers which it would use to place bets on horse races, on their behalf.

After this company ceased trading, he contacted two of his elderly clients and pretended he would continue investing their money in the same way, but instead used it to fund his lifestyle, paying for restaurants and booking a hotel in Ibiza.

Dani and Sammy first began dating prior to her appearance on Love Island in 2018 and split before rekindling their romance in 2019.

The pair announced they were expecting their first child together in July 2020 and Dani and Sammy welcomed son Santiago in January, earlier this year.

And Coronation Street star Sam Aston and his wife Briony have revealed that it was 'a bit of a shock' and 'stressful' when their little one arrived early.

Speaking to Ok! the pair told how the yoga instructor stayed in hospital for nine days after her labour while her little one was tube fed and recovered from jaundice.

Sam, 28, - who has played Chesney Brown in Corrie since 2003 -, said: 'It was a bit of a shock for me. Everyone at work knew he wasn't due until September.'

Briony, 26, added: 'It was hard at the time but looking back now I'd do it all again tomorrow. It was so nice to get home though.'

Their situation was made even more difficult due to the fact that Sam was only allowed to visit the pair in hospital for one hour a day due to the pandemic.

Firstborn: Speaking to Ok! the pair revealed that the yoga instructor stayed in hospital for nine days after her labour while her little one was tube fed and recovered from jaundice

Sam explained: 'An hour felt like 10 minutes, especially early on as Briony was emotional as I was trying to be there and spend time with Sonny.'

Briony added that having time constraints on their time together was the most 'stressful' part and that she would usually 'sob for an hour' and then Sam would have to leave.

The couple added that his development has caught up in the last year and his breathing has returned to normal.

Sam and Briony tied the knot in 2019, two years after the couple announced their engagement.

Doting parents: Sam, 28, - who has played Chesney Brown in Corrie since 2003 -, said: 'It was a bit of a shock for me. Everyone at work knew he wasn't due until September'

The couple first announced they were expecting a boy when speaking with OK! magazine, saying: 'We're having a boy! It was a massive surprise when we found out, as there are loads of girls in our families, so we were adamant we were having a girl.'

The new mother often shares insights into her life and how she is coping with the arrival of her son.

Late last year Briony conducted a Q&A session on her Instagram story, answering questions from her 13,000 followers.

When asked to share her 'last photo', Briony posted a candid snap of herself breastfeeding Sonny, which she captioned 'tired but besotted'.

Loved-up! It comes after late last year Briony shared a selection of her son Sonny's milestone moments on her Instagram Stories during a Q&A

In the image, Briony flashed a smile for the camera while her young son fed.

Briony also shared a picture moments after Sonny's birth as she cradled him on her chest while lying in a hospital bed following her labour.

She wrote: 'My amazing midwife actually got videos/photos of him being born and I can't help but look back at them most days.

'It helps me process just how miraculous the human body is. But there definitely TMI so this is the first suitable photo. [sic]

Briony also posted the 'first picture' of Sonny, which was an ultrasound scan at seven weeks and five days, she quipped: 'Technically this is it - our little blueberry'.

Also included in the series of photographs was the first time Sam held his son in his arms, as Briony wrote: 'Ohh good one! This is the first photo I have from when he's a day old, Sam might have some from earlier. But look at how tiny Sonny's head was.'

Last month Briony proclaimed motherhood has turned her into a 'lioness' shortly before sharing a breastfeeding snap.

The new mum proudly shared an image while feeding Sonny and then shared a snap of his feet alongside a message about an exchange she had with a midwife.

Milestone moments: Briony, who welcomed her son prematurely, asked her followers which photographs they would like her to share on the page

In the touching caption which marked World Prematurity Day, she penned: 'Before we left the hospital after having Sonny, a midwife said to me “Briony, do you realise that the minute you leave this hospital you’ll become a lioness?”...

'And I can honestly say never before have I felt so powerful, protective and proud, and never has a sentence been so true. My boy, my cub, my premature baby'.

Briony revealed that Sonny's birth was 'calm' despite him being born six weeks premature. They had been trying for a baby for little over a month before getting the result and Briony revealed that nothing prepared her for the joy of parenthood.

She said to her social media followers in August: 'Nothing could have truly prepared me for your entrance into this world'

'A journey of complete surrender and the most intense surges of energy I have ever felt in my life. But I understand now that it had to be this way. How else could my heart come to live outside of my body?'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Nicole Scherzinger was seen leaving a taping of The Masked Singer in Los Angeles on Sunday evening.

The 43-year-old performer appeared to be enjoying the spotlight as she wore a glammed-up outfit while taking a solo stroll after finishing up the night's work.

The Pussycat Dolls member has worked on the reality singing competition series ever since its premiere in 2019 and has previously spoken about her enjoyment of being a panelist.

Working hard: Nicole Scherzinger was seen taking a stroll after finishing a taping of The Masked Singer in Los Angeles on Sunday evening

Scherzinger wore a dual-tone green dress that notably featured a sparkling right side and a flat left during the taping.

She paired her outfit with a pair of slightly lighter high-heeled shoes as she took a post-event stroll.

The actress accessorized with several articles of jewelry, including a sparkling ring worn on her left hand.

Her gorgeous brunette hair cascaded onto her shoulders and backside as she made her way around the taping area.

Eye-catching ensemble: The performer sported a green dress and slightly lighter heels for the show's taping

Scherzinger has been involved with The Masked Singer ever since its inception in 2019.

The show is based on the Korean show King of Mask Singer, which initially premiered in 2015.

The performer regularly appears alongside fellow panelists Ken Jeong, Robin Thicke and Jenny McCarthy in all of the episodes, with Nick Cannon serving as a host.

Joel McHale has appeared in every season of the hit Fox show since its inception.

Sticking with it: Scherzinger has served as a panelist on The Masked Singer ever since its inception in 2019

During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scherzinger expressed that she was heavily invested in The Masked Singer's success for a very personal reason.

She remarked, 'with doing a lot of these talent-searching shows, I do get very emotional because music is the best way of communication and connection to me.'

The actress also gave the media outlet her take on why the program has become so well-known with audiences and lauded the series' unorthodox take on competition shows.

'I think that's what's so bizarre and so special about our show is that you're looking at these crazy costumes and these faces that don't move. And yet you're moved by these contestants, you're moved by their performances,' she said.

Something special: The performer sat down for an interview with Entertainment Weekly where she expressed that the show's viewers were able to be 'moved' by the performances of its contestants

The hitmaker also expressed that she saw The Masked Singer as a way for the performers to let out their deepest feelings without fear of ridicule.

'I feel like with that mask on, it gives them the courage to let go more, but they're really revealing all from the inside out,' she noted.

Scherzinger concluded by expressing that she was happy to be one of the program's main figures and stated that she enjoyed a close relationship with her collaborators.

'It doesn't even feel like a job. It's the best job in the world. I get to go to work with the panelists, who are my close friends that I adore and love,' she said.

Feeling good: Scherzinger also described working on the hit show as 'the best job in the world'; she is seen with Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier in 2019

Noting that she's far from alone in her dilemma, Jessica told the publication: 'I really feel for all brides out there. Every day, we have been back and forth trying to decide what to do – I've been driving myself insane with it.'

She continued: 'We always wanted to get wed abroad with all our family and friends, but we have explored every option, different dates, different places. A few weeks ago I said to Will: "Shall we have a smaller wedding here in England?"

Of their autumn wedding, she explained: 'It gives more time for things to get back to normal and for all our nearest and dearest to be there.

'I have definitely relaxed since setting the new date. I can't wait to wear my dress – I just want to do it now.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@When Mike Padgham bought a Scarborough cafe bar in June 2019, it was his first foray into the hospitality sector.

He and son Jordan, 26, the manager, were full of excitement as they recruited staff and refurbished The Hideout. But nine months later, the Padghams were forced to shut as the first national lockdown took hold. Within weeks they had furloughed all their employees and taken out a £50,000 ‘bounce back’ loan.

When restrictions on indoor dining were lifted in May, they hoped to be able to get back on track. But the curse of the NHS Covid-19 app has since cost them £13,500. Mike, 65, tells Fiona Parker how the ‘pingdemic’ wreaked havoc on his business.

Fearing the next ping: Mike Padgham the owner of The Hideout cafe in Scarborough who had to close for after four staff were pinged

Sunday, June 27: Our first employee is ‘pinged’ at around 5.30pm. He is a waiter who had been walking home from his shift. We have about 20 employees who work from either 8am to 4pm or 4pm to 10pm, with 11pm closing times on Friday and Saturday. He rings Jordan and my son tells the other staff. Some carry on working as normal but others are anxious that they might have caught the virus. I oversee the financial side of the business while Jordan spends more time in the restaurant.

We are in no doubt that our waiter has to self-isolate. He will receive statutory sick pay on top of holiday pay he accrued while on furlough. His absence will have little effect on service but I have a sinking feeling about what is to come... The Hideout survived the pandemic but will it survive the pingdemic?

Monday, June 28, AM: My fears are confirmed when two more front-of-house staff are pinged. Given that ten employees are usually on shift at any one time, our team is reduced by a fifth. Finding new recruits isn’t easy. The pandemic has drained the economy of hospitality workers, who got fed up waiting for restaurants and bars to reopen. One of our chefs left to work as a delivery driver. A team leader got a supermarket job. We have been looking for new staff since April but there are no quick fixes that can resolve today’s crisis.

Monday, June 28, PM: Jordan and I discuss what to do. We don’t have enough employees to cover every shift for the next six days. It is heartbreaking to think we might have to close again. We decide to cut our opening hours instead. Around 60pc of our takings are made during the evening shift, so breakfast and lunch is sacrificed for dinner. We agree that for the next six days The Hideout will open from 4pm, with normal service resuming on Monday, July 5.

A message to self-isolate displayed on the NHS coronavirus contact tracing app

Tuesday, June 29: The Hideout’s Facebook account is used to let customers know of our change in opening hours. A note is also pinned on the cafe’s front door. But as not everyone has seen the Facebook post, several people only find out we are closed when they turn up. We also have dozens of bookings that can no longer go ahead, so we call each customer to tell them what has happened. Everyone seems supportive but I’m worried what customers will think.

Sunday, July 4: We have lost about £8,000 in takings from being on reduced hours but I’m really grateful for all the support our staff have shown us. Three have come in on their days off to help cover shifts. This afternoon we return to Facebook to let customers know we will open at 8am tomorrow. It should be a happy moment but I go to sleep wondering whether another employee will have been pinged by the time I wake up.

Thursday, July 15: We were free of the pings for almost two weeks but I knew our luck wouldn’t last. Jordan receives two more calls from staff. One of them is a chef and we need at least two in the kitchen at any one time. We frantically rearrange the rota — but this time we can’t get away with reduced hours alone and will have to close for two full days. As Monday and Tuesday are our least profitable days, they are the obvious choice. But we still ended up losing £5,500 as a result.

We have dozens of bookings that can no longer go ahead, so we call each customer to tell them what has happened. Everyone seems supportive but I’m worried what customers will think

Tuesday, August 3: FIingers crossed, we haven’t been hit by any further pings. We have also managed to recruit three more employees. But I am living in fear that the pingdemic could force us to close again at any moment. On Friday we had our first positive case — a waitress who had been on leave for a week beforehand.

As she she had been off for several days by the time she developed mild symptoms, no other Hideout employees have had to self-isolate. None of our four pinged staff members ended up testing positive for the virus. I welcome the decision to reduce the five-day window in which contacts are traced to two — it’s a start. However, if this will only cut the number of people being pinged by tens of thousands, then more needs to be done.

Ministers have said that from August 16, anyone pinged by the app will no longer have to self-isolate if they are fully vaccinated. But why wait so long? My staff are all young and many are still waiting for their second jab. But even if they are pinged, surely if someone can prove they don’t have the virus through daily testing, they shouldn’t have to stay at home? One person in every five in the industry was self-isolating last week — that’s the impact this is having on our sector.

I’m very grateful for the help we have had, especially from Scarborough Borough Council, which was so quick to pay out our £10,000 small business grant at the beginning of the pandemic. And I know how lucky we are not to have been seriously ill with the virus, when so many others have been in hospital and died. But even though our turnover was £350,000 last year, we are yet to break even. And while the pingdemic rages, we don’t stand a chance of making up our losses.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Britons who have lost their local bank branch or cash machine may soon be able to get hold of their money at their nearest corner shop, thanks to the UK’s first 'Click & Collect' cash service.

Using the same technology retailers use to pay out lottery winnings, financial platform Sonect wants to to enable them to also give the public free access to their cash.

It runs on a location-based app, which connects shops with cash to people who need it, by matching demand for cash withdrawals with the cash in shop tills.

Sonect’s deal with Lottomatica and BNL Bank in Italy will enable 35,000 Italian lottery terminals to offer cash withdrawals later this year

Italian shoppers are set to start withdrawing money in this way later this year, as Sonect is under contract to enable 35,000 Italian lottery terminals to offer free cash.

With 95 per cent of the UK population living within one mile of a lottery terminal, Sonect says it can help solve the 'access to cash crisis' in the UK.

Bank branches and free-to-use cash machines have been disappearing from Britain's high streets at a record pace in recent years.

Since January 2015, bank branches have been closing at a rate of 50 each month, according to the Consumer Champion Which?, and a total of 4,299 have shut their doors during that time.

With over 500 closures since the pandemic alone, and ATMs reducing from a peak of around 71,000 in 2015 to 54,000 in 2020 according to Government figures, convenient access to cash is on a steep decline.

Almost two thirds of the industry's top executives think branch-based lenders will be 'dead' in the next five years, according to a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit for financial software company Temenos.

Sonect intends to turn cash registers into ATMs, using the existing point of sale system or any smartphone to localise the processing of cash

But while the use of physical money is declining, millions of Britons still rely on cash, particularly the elderly.

Around 2.4 million people aged 65 and over rely on cash to a large extent in their day-to-day life, according to data from the Financial Conduct Authority.

Sonect is a location-based app, connecting shops with cash to people who need it

According to a recent survey, nearly three-quarters of over-65s, around 8.8 million people, had used cash at some point in the past month. Two-thirds of under-65s, or around 25 million adults, had also done so within that time.

Sonect has been piloting its cash scheme in Burslem and Tunstall in Stoke-on-Trent, and says hundreds of residents have signed up in the past two months.

In these towns, it says both the public and its retailers are already enjoying the convenience of cash circulating locally free of charge.

Tony Riaz, who runs a One Stop in Burslem said: 'This lottery terminal solution sounds like a no-brainer to me - I already know my customers would love the speed and convenience of getting some cash at the same time as their lottery tickets.

'A simple idea like this would be perfect for guaranteeing a free access to cash solution in the UK.'

The app will allow residents to pick up money from a range of participating stores, but Sonect say that around 45,000 brand-new terminals will need to be installed to guarantee free access to cash nationwide.

Ron Delnevo, UK director of Sonect said: 'In the UK we're under-utilising the potential of modern lottery terminals to provide a wide-range of services to customers of community retailers.

'The terminals can become a vital convenient local touch-point for access to cash, and other services the public have a right to expect on their doorsteps.

'We really need to seize this technical innovation opportunity in the UK to support all the local needs of the public and the retailers who serve them and, critically, to solve the huge access to cash crisis.'

Gogglebox star Ellie Warner has been giving fans an insight into her huge home renovation project, which she's completing with her boyfriend Nat.

The reality star, 28, is doing up her 1930s semi-detatched house in Leeds and has already garnered a staggering 40 thousand followers with her decorating updates.

Self-proclaimed 'lovers of colour & second hand finds,' Ellie most recently wowed her followers with a striking orange radiator in her living room.

New home: Ellie announced she'd bought her home with Nat back in March and couldn't wait to gush to her followers about the purchase

Ellie wrote on her home account @throughmykeyhole: 'Lil sneaky peak of my living room. Things are starting to take shape now and hopefully I’m gonna have a fully functioning living room after tomorrow night.

'Can’t wait to share it in all it’s glory. The radiators, the paper, the blue I’m just living for it all. Everyone thought I was mad when I said I was getting bright orange radiators but how effing cool are they?!?!'

The Gogglebox star's unique interior taste was certainly eye-catching, with vibrant orange radiators positioned against limited edition coral, blue, brown and cream wallpaper from Graham and Brown.

On the non-papered walls, Ellie contrasted the vibey heating appliance with a subtler grey blue paint from Valspar.

Dining room: Ellie had sourced a gorgeous bespoke table made from reclaimed scaffold boards with two benches that could slide underneath

'Everyone thought I was mad when I said I was getting bright orange radiators but how effing cool are they?!?!' Ellie gushed of her striking lounge decor choices

But it hasn't all been smooth sailing for the couple as they work towards creating their dream home together in Leeds.

Ellie admitted in a seperate post: 'Been at a bit of a stand still the last couple of weeks with working/ things going wrong.

But progress is finally being made this weekend!! Sneaky peak of the colour that’s going in the living room! Hoping to finish all the painting that needs to be done in the living room today.

'Wish me luck on the hottest weekend of the year so far! Already sweating me tits off.'

In their dining room, Ellie sourced a gorgeous bespoke table made from reclaimed scaffold boards with two benches that slide underneath.

The star explained she might also get three chairs to go on one side of the table and save the second bench for when they need extra seating.

Behind the table, Nat had chipped off old plaster from their original chimney to reveal the exposed red brick underneath.

Ellie told her followers: 'Still don’t have a clue what else I’m gonna do in here but I just knew I had to get this out of the way first as it’s such a messy job! I’ve got dust in places I never knew dust could reach.'

Ellie announced she'd bought her home with Nat back in March and couldn't wait to gush to her followers about the purchase.

She wrote at the time: 'Soon to be our home… We're looking at exchanging [at the] end of May/June time. I'm so excited.'

Posting a photo of the 1930s semi-detached house, Northerner Ellie added: 'We're so lucky the current owners have kept it in immaculate condition so we can move straight in and just do things as we go along!'

Before: ' Still don’t have a clue what else I’m gonna do in here but I just knew I had to get this out of the way first as it’s such a messy job! I’ve got dust in places I never knew dust could reach,' Ellie told her followers of the renovation work

Ellie also joked that her partner has banned her from browsing online retailer Facebook Marketplace.

'Nat has banned me from looking on Facebook Marketplace, but can't wait to get in and start making this house our home,' she quipped.

Sharing a second photo hours later, Ellie showed off the property's back garden, thanking fans for their overwhelming response.

She shared: 'This is the view from the back garden! I can't wait to be sat on that patio in the sunshine with a nice cold beveragino!'

Ellie also said her beloved pet dogs would love the outdoor space, but explained she won't be posting any photos of her new home's interiors just yet, out of respect for the current occupants' privacy.

Detailing the home's layout, she continued: '@mickmadgeandmorris are gonna love playing in the garden and brucey bonus it's already doggy secure as the current owners have small dogs too!

'The dorma room is the master bedroom with en suite and hopefully one day when we've saved enough pennies we can extend out the back, bifold doors, velux windows you know the drill!

Ellie, who appears on the Channel 4 show alongside her sister Izzi Warner, has been dating boyfriend Nat for more than two years, and tends to keep her relationship out of the spotlight.

'Thank you for sharing all your birth stories, I was so moved reading your comments.'

'After I got home from hospital I tried to rest as much as possible. I was very fortunate that I had both Hugo and an amazing postnatal Doula called Paula (who used to be my nanny!) looking after us for the first three weeks which played a big part in my recovery.

'I didn’t leave the house for at least a week when I felt strong enough to go for a walk around the block.

'I slowly started increasing the length of my walks but got carried away I did too much and ended up in bed with cramps and with heavy bleeding.

'My advice is to listen to your body and take it very slowly, get as much help as you can so that you can rest and let your body heal.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A new TV drama series about the investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence has been accused of downplaying the role of the Daily Mail in bringing the killers to justice.

Actor Steve Coogan stars as the detective whose remorseless work was crucial to two men being convicted of murder.

The officer, Clive Driscoll, joined the murder investigation in 2006, 13 years after Stephen was killed by a gang of white men in a racist attack in Eltham, South London.

However, that was nine years after the Daily Mail launched a campaign to bring the 18-year-old’s killers to justice after a series of police blunders that led to the investigation stalling.

A new TV drama series starring Steve Coogan about the investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence has been accused of downplaying the role of the Daily Mail in bringing the killers to justice

Steve Coogan's character, Clive Driscoll, joined the murder investigation in 2006, 13 years after Stephen (pictured) was killed by a gang of white men in a racist attack in Eltham, London

Yesterday, MP Julian Knight, chairman of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, spoke of his surprise that the series – called Stephen and due to air later this month – will not include plot lines or scenes that relate to the Mail’s Justice For Stephen Lawrence campaign.

He said the decision was ‘an extraordinary oversight’, adding: ‘It seems bizarre that a drama depicting the horrific events and pursuit of justice doesn’t take account of one of the most effective and worthy campaigns in Fleet Street history.’

Hat Trick Productions, which is owned by Line Of Duty creator Jed Mercurio and is behind the series, said it had chosen to concentrate on other aspects of the case, although, at the end of the first episode viewers will see the Mail’s 1997 front page which branded five suspects as ‘Murderers’.

None of the characters is based on journalists, such as the paper’s then Editor, Paul Dacre, who has said he was inspired to fight for justice after watching the ‘sickening and arrogant contempt of the suspects in refusing to answer any questions at the inquest’.

Yesterday, MP Julian Knight, chairman of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, spoke of his surprise that the series will not include plot lines or scenes that relate to the Mail’s Justice For Stephen Lawrence campaign

Coogan describes his character, DCI Clive Driscoll, now 70, as someone with ‘ordinary decency’ who proved that ‘doing the right thing sometimes makes sense’.

The actor has long been a critic of the Daily Mail and a supporter of anti-Press lobby group Hacked Off. Coogan, 55, has said: ‘If the Daily Mail went to the wall tomorrow, I’d be delighted. There are lots of other, better, newspapers – it’s worse than the tabloids.’

The ITV series will feature the brave fight of Stephen’s parents Doreen (now a peer) and Neville, played in the drama by Sharlene Whyte and Hugh Quarshie.

Doreen has said that until the Mail’s controversial front page: ‘Nobody – apart from those in their local neighbourhood – really knew what these boys looked like. Then the whole country knew.

'If the Mail hadn’t been publicising what was happening around Stephen and getting it out there, a lot of people wouldn’t have known about the injustice around him as a young man.’

Following its 1997 Murderers front-page headline, the Mail ran numerous stories on the case, chronicling moves to reform double jeopardy laws to allow Stephen’s killers to stand trial a second time, the setting up of a public inquiry and the scandal of how bungling police officers escaped sanction.

The Daily Mail's 1997 Stephen Lawrence front-page headline: ‘Murderers’, above pictures of the five main suspects with the words: ‘The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us'

After Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered the judicial inquiry into the killing, the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon apologised to the Lawrences, admitting failures in the investigation.

Then, in 2002, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone.

But three years later the Government dropped the legal principle that prevented suspects being tried twice for the same crime and police announced they were investigating new forensic evidence in 2005.

Finally, in 2011, Gary Dobson and David Norris were put on trial at the Old Bailey and found guilty of murder. Dobson was jailed for a minimum of 15 years and Norris for 14 years.

Coogan, best known for his comic character Alan Partridge, said: ‘I don’t often play nice people, so it was a nice change to play someone with a simple, unannounced integrity.’

Speaking to co-hosts Charlene White, 41, Jane Moore, 59 and Brenda Edwards, 52, The Saturdays star began: 'My sister stepped up when I had my breakdown.'

Frankie continued: 'I don’t even remember her being there and I can’t remember I was much conversation.

'I had a panic attack at dinner': The glamorous outing comes after Frankie opened up on Loose Women last week about how her and her sister have emotionally supported each other

'I remember we were out for dinner and I had this panic attack and she just went along with that.'

Frankie suffered a mental health breakdown in 2011 at the age of 23, which resulted in month-long admission at London's Nightingale Hospital.

After Frankie revealed how Victoria had been there for her in a time of need, she then reflected on the times she repaid the favour.

Frankie said: 'I kind of did the same for her with her IVF journey recently. Her husband was in Bermuda and she was here and I went to a lot of appointments with her and there were times when she would cry and I didn’t know how to deal with it.

Bond: Frankie appeared on the panel of Thursday's Loose Women as they discussed sibling relationships, with Frankie detailing her special bond with elder sister Victoria

'I’m a hugger and talk about my feelings but she’s the complete opposite. It’s hard to know how to be there for someone like that.'

Victoria - who welcomed twin boys in October - has been candid with her fertility issues after previously speaking about how she had suffered three miscarriages while trying for a baby.

Frankie added that she and footballer husband Wayne Bridge, 41, always tell their children to always be there for their siblings because of her own experiences.

Tyra opened up Smize Cream in Santa Monica, California last month.

The party, which is thrown annually by producer Jennifer Klein, is a regular retreat for the A-listers and a chance for them to take in some pleasurable pampering.

The ultra-wealthy actresses and entertainers each are given a variety of expensive swag for free, and several stars were spotted pushing out massive Samsonite suitcases, which InStyle reported could be filled with as much as 80lbs of goodies.

The event seems to be quite the afternoon of fun as guests are treated to food and beverages as different parts of the property make for different experiences including a free outdoor swag bazaar in the backyard and pop-up boutiques in rooms that include a mix of shopping and gifting.

The celebrities can then end the day relaxing by the pool where there are spa treatments available.

Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Rodrigo, Christina Hendricks and Alexandra Daddario, were just a few of the major celebrities seen at the event.

This is the 23rd year for the unmissable event, which continued last year despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

At that event, attendance was limited compared to previous years, and guests were required to be masked and to social distance at all times.

It's unclear if the guests list was curtailed again for 2021, though several guests were still seen wearing masks at various times.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Shawn Levy recently stated that the highly-awaited fourth season of the hit Netflix show Stranger Things would be 'super worth the wait.'

The program's executive producer, 53, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter and gave his opinion about several projects with which he was heavily involved.

The Night At The Museum director then fielded a question about the sci-fi program and told the media outlet about various aspects of the forthcoming run of episodes, which will premiere next year.

Hyping it up: Stranger Things' executive producer Shawn Levy recently stated that the highly-awaited fourth season of the show would be 'super worth the wait'; he is seen in 2019

Levy began the interview by expressing that he and the show's creators were aware of the hype that has been generated regarding the program and desired to make them available to the public as soon as possible.

He noted, 'We are long-delayed, and the Duffers and I want to share season four with the world as badly as the world wants it.'

The filmmaker noted that the reason that the run of episodes has taken so long to produce is based on the scale that the series' producers had in mind.

'Part of what's taking time is long before Covid and the pandemic existed, season four was built to be by far the most ambitious, cinematic, sprawling and epic season that we've ever done...by a lot,' he said.

Great expectations: Levy also expressed that the forthcoming run of episodes would be 'by far the most ambitious, cinematic, sprawling and epic season that we've ever done'

Levy concluded by expressing that the next set of episodes would please fans of the show despite the time that it has taken to make them as fine-tuned as possible.

He expressed: 'the complexity of season four, even before we had the obstacles, hurdles and challenges of a pandemic, is taking a lot of time because it is super worth the wait.'

Stranger Things' fourth run of episodes was originally planned long before it was officially announced that the show had been renewed for another time.

The announcement was made public with a teaser that was released in September of 2019.

Going back: Planning for the fourth season of Stranger Things occurred long before it was officially announced that a new set of episodes was in development

Several new performers were added to the show that year, with numerous others joining during the new season's development process.

Series regulars Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder and David Harbour, as well as many of the returning cast members, are set to reprise their roles from the previous seasons.

New actors on the program include Jamie Campbell Bower and Eduardo Franco, who were added as series regulars.

Performers such as Robert Englund, Myles Truitt and Amybeth McNulty were also cast in recurring roles.

Physical production on Stranger Things' fourth season initially began in February of last year, with filming taking place in Lithuania.

The show's team then moved to Atlanta before shooting was shut down in March due to the onset of the global pandemic.

Filming eventually resumed in later September after numerous delays.

However, a definitive release date for the fourth season of Stranger Things has not been set as of yet.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Future, the owner of magazines including Country Life and Wallpaper, has snapped up Dennis, the publisher of titles including MoneyWeek and The Week, in a £300million deal.

FTSE 250-listed Future, which also owns TechRadar and football magazine FourFourTwo, is buying Dennis Publishing from Exponent, a UK-based private equity firm.

The deal is the latest acquisition by Britain's biggest magazine publisher, which last year bought price comparison website GoCompare for £594million.

Future will be the new owner of current affairs magazine The Week in the UK and US

The news sent shares in Future rising 7.5 per cent to £39.63 in late afternoon trading on Monday.

Under the deal, Future is adding a number of titles to its stable, including the adult and junior versions of current affairs magazine The Week in the UK and US, MoneyWeek, Kiplinger, Science & Nature, IT Pro, Computer Active, PC Pro, Minecraft World, and Coach.

However, Exponent, which acquired Dennis in 2018 for £166million, will hold on to some titles, including Viz, Fortean Times, Cyclist and Expert Reviews.

Future said the move will help to expand its reach in the US, where 56 per cent of Dennis revenues are currently generated.

Under the leadership of Zillah Byng-Thorne, Future has expanded rapidly into a digitally-led media business and launched a series of daring takeovers.

Earlier this year, it bought Mozo, an Australian price comparison website that focuses on selling financial products like loans and bank accounts, for £17million.

Last year, it snapped up TI Media - which publishes 40 titles including Horse & Hound, Woman & Home and Wallpaper - in a a £140million deal.

Buying spree: Future's latest deal comes after last year's acquisition of GoCompare for £594m

'I am delighted to announce the acquisition of a high-quality portfolio of Dennis' trusted brands that will accelerate our strategy, enhance our content capabilities and bring additional geographical and vertical revenue diversification, whilst materially increasing the proportion of recurring revenues across the group,' Byng-Thorne said.

James Tye, chief executive at Dennis, said: 'In the three years that the business has been owned by Exponent, Dennis has been on an incredible growth journey, delivering double-digit increases in subscription revenues, a greatly increased US footprint, and significant bottom-line increases.

'This is a testament to the talented team at Dennis who have helped make all of this happen.'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A brief scroll through social media, and it’s easy to think that everyone on earth has a perfectly styled home that’s not only permanently clean, but somehow always on trend. Where do these people find the time and money?

All of this can be quite daunting - particularly if you have a young family. Any dreams of clean, minimalist living can be waved goodbye the minute you throw a small person into the mix!

But for TV starlet, wellbeing influencer, and busy mummy Lucy Mecklenburgh, starting a family hasn't stopped her house from being a stylish home (and it didn't cost a fortune, either!).

From juggling parenting and decorating to creating fun spaces for her son to grow up in, Lucy reveals how to create a stylish family home - and how Dunelm can help you achieve it.

Having a young family can be time-consuming - but Lucy's figured out a way to make some small but perfect decor updates to make her house a home

Family-proof fashion

Prior to the arrival of her 18-month-old son, Roman, Lucy Mecklenburgh’s home had style on par with the most glamorous social media stars. As it was just her and her partner, Ryan, she had all the time in the world to keep it looking glam.

‘Before Roman came along, our place was minimalist and not at all ready for kids, very Scandi and contemporary in style,’ she shares. ‘But when I fell pregnant with Roman, I took the lead on redesigning our home.'

Knowing that plain whites and neutrals wouldn’t survive long once her son arrived, Lucy took the time to research various styles that would be better suited to family living; looks that were warm and welcoming yet practical (for those ‘real life’ moments the social channels never reveal!).

‘The biggest change had to be swapping out the minimalism for a cosier vibe, so I filled my living spaces with lots of big rugs, throws and cushions.

Opting for practicality doesn't mean you have to sacrifice style - as you can see with this slick mango wood Dunelm Small Indi Sideboard (£399)

‘These are much more inviting and give our place a really homely family feel which I love - and they’re all patterned to hide any mess that Roman makes!’

Lucy's Dunelm top picks Check out Lucy’s favourite items which can make a house feel like a stylish yet family-friendly home - all available from Dunelm. Silhouette Cushion Cover, £6 Pebble Mirror Gold, £45 Churchgate Ceramic Ripple Vase, £15 Indi Small Sideboard, £399 Hot Air Balloon Rattan EasyFit Pendant light, £40

Soft furnishings like Dunelm's Silhouette Cushion Cover (£6), one of Lucy's top Dunelm picks, is ideal for this vibe as it's lovely and soft, thanks to it being made from 100% cotton. Its chic design can also help hide all manner of sins - and, for those occasions where your chosen patterns don't hide those inevitable stains, it's machine washable too.

The arrival of Roman also triggered a flood of baby toys, gadgets and accessories, something that had Lucy’s inner minimalist in total despair.

That’s where nifty storage solutions come in handy.

‘Becoming a mum has forced me to become more practical with my design choices, and I’ve incorporated more storage throughout our home,’ she reveals.

‘Now we have wooden sideboards - like Dunelm's mango wood Indi Sideboard - which have the dual purpose of looking stylish while hiding all of Roman’s ugly plastic toys. A must!'

Savvy home tweaks for savvy families

Small changes here and there seem simple in principle, but nothing is entirely plain sailing when you have little ones running around, which Lucy can relate to.

‘Sometimes I want to get on with a small project and Roman wants to be involved, so I give him a toy hammer or paintbrush to busy himself with - but it’s not ideal!

‘Ideally, if I have home projects on I like to take Roman to his grandparents so he’s fully out of the way. Fortunately my partner has no interest in interior design, so he’s more than happy for me to just get on with whatever I want to do, which is one less thing to worry about.'

However, childcare and spouses aren't the only barrier to making those homely touches. Often, half the challenge is figuring out how best to improve a room so it works better for you and your family.

'I found sorting out our hallway a real struggle,' admits Lucy. 'It seems trivial but it’s the entrance to our home and very big, so I’ve always found it a challenging area to decorate.

Stepping back, Lucy considered her family's needs as well as how to give the space more purpose.

'I added a rug, table and chairs so it's useful; it's created an assigned space to sit, put shoes on and get ready to go out every day. I then accessorised with wall art, faux plants and the contemporary Dunelm Pebble Gold Mirror (£45), so it’s now an attractive entrance room too.

'It feels like it's part of the home rather than just an empty space.'

Often, it's the little changes that have the power to make a huge difference - and they can be fun too.

Lucy employed this mentality when creating her son's nursery.

'I had the most fun planning and decorating Roman's room. And the coolest thing about it is the little monkey lampshade I bought him. Everyone who visits still fawns over it now!'

Want to add a little fun to your child's bedroom or playroom? Dunelm has statement children's lighting in abundance. From their statement Hot Air Balloon Pendant to the adorable Roar! Dinosaur Lamp, there are lots of quick and fun options to give a litte one's room personality in a flash.

From mood-enhancing lamps like the timeless Kyoto Table Lamp (£15) to cosy throws, or statement ornaments, such as Lucy's Churchgate Ceramic Ripple Vase (just £15 from Dunelm), it's easier than you think to give your family space a fresh new feel without denting the wallet.

Whether it's these little touches or bigger homeware must-haves - such as stylish beds and sofas - Lucy says parents can't go wrong with Dunelm.

Enhance the cosiness of your family living spaces with warm lighting, a simple yet effective way to transform a room at the flick of a switch!

'I've always found Dunelm great for getting great value products that are both stylish and practical – and I can’t resist grabbing gorgeous accessories for my house before getting to the check-out!

'I’m mad for things that make a house feel like a home: scatter cushions, candles and mirrors are my go-to.

'But it's also great for those hardwearing things all families need. Irresistibly soft bedding, handmade rugs - they've got it all and it's really affordable too. You can't go wrong!'

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sub-prime lender Provident Financial saw its statutory losses swell to £44.2million in the first six months of this year.

But, excluding its consumer credit division, the group's adjusted profit jumped to £63.5million, up from £4.9million the year before.

Over four million customers of the lender can start claiming compensation after the High Court gave the green light to the group's repayment plan last week.

Results: Sub-prime lender Provident Financial saw its statutory losses swell to £44.2m in the first six months of this year

Affected Provident customers who were sold unaffordable loans by the sub-prime lender will need to register via an online portal in order to kick off their compensation claims.

Applications for compensation must be made within a six-month period.

The compensation scheme applies to borrowers who were sold unaffordable loans between 6 April 2007 and 17 December 2020 from one of Provident's personal credit brands.

They are doorstep lender Provident, Satsuma payday loans, Greenwood, which was a doorstep lender that has been defunct since 2014, and Glo, which is a guarantor loan brand.

Shares in Provident, which is listed on the London Stock Market, are currently up 1.56 per cent or 4.80p to 312.00p. A year ago the share price was 195.80p, meaning it has risen by nearly 60 per cent in the past year.

The group said it would not be declaring a dividend payout to shareholders for the first half, 'as the focus remains on preserving capital during the period of closure of the Consumer Credit Division business.'

It added: 'The group will revisit its policy at the year end, allowing time for the board to assess the impact of the end of furlough, and any future lockdown restrictions, on the group’s customers.'

The company's credit card and personal loans arm, Vanquis Bank, reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of £57.1million in the first half, up from £11.8million at the same point last year.

The group said the profit at Vanquis was 'driven by lower impairments as a result of more favourable macroeconomic conditions.' But, new customer numbers in this arm stood at 97,000 over the period, down from 147,000 a year ago.

The group's vehicle finance business, Moneybarn, delivered an adjusted pre-tax profit for the period of £15.5million, up from £2.3million at the same point in 2020.

This was 'driven by higher revenue year-on-year, as a result of the growth in the receivables book, and lower impairment,' Provident said.

Payment holiday take-up by Moneybarn customers has been 'extremely low' and ended the period at just 0.1 per cent of customers, down from 3.5 per cent last year, it said.

Malcolm Le May, the group's chief executive, said today: 'The first six months of 2021 showed a marked contrast to the extremely difficult conditions seen throughout 2020.

'Underlying customer trends and macroeconomic conditions have improved year-on-year, allowing us to focus on the core businesses, which is reflected in our results.'

Payouts: Over 4million Provident Financial customers can now apply for compensation

He added: 'In March, we notified the market of our intention to launch a Scheme of Arrangement for CCD and in May, regrettably, we took the difficult decision to place the business into a managed run-off.

'I am pleased that the proposed Scheme of Arrangement for CCD, which was provided for in our 2020 accounts, was sanctioned by the High Court on 4 August.

'We can now continue to move forwards with our plans to close the business before paying customer redress claims during 2022.

'During the remainder of 2021, PFG will accelerate its transition towards becoming the leading specialist bank focused on financially underserved customers, serving growing market segments with a range of mid-cost products across credit cards, vehicle finance and unsecured personal loans.'

In March, Provident announced its Consumer Credit Division's scheme of arrangement, and in May it announced the closure and managed wind down of the division.

Provident wrote to 4.3million of its former and current customers, telling them that its consumer credit division could collapse into administration unless they agreed to a sharp reduction in compensation payments for mis-selling.

Doorstep lending is a form of high-cost, short-term credit where payments are collected at the borrowers' home.

Provident has now set aside £50million in order to meet the compensation claims of affected borrowers mis-sold loans by the company.

But, affected customers will not be receiving all their money back after the company warned that full compensation payments would force it to go bust leaving many affected with nothing at all.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Those who fail to switch energy supplier could be unwittingly adding hundreds of pounds to annual bills.

But moving suppliers doesn't have to be a hassle. Below we explain how to search for the right deal for you, which providers offer the cheapest rates and what switching involves.

If you've never switched supplier, you could save a lot of money by moving to a different firm

Golden rule - ditch the standard variable rate tariff

Standard variable rate tariffs (SVT) are the out of contract deals your energy provider will move you to once your fixed deal ends.

People who have been on an SVT for the last 12 months instead of switching to a cheap fixed deal could have over-paid by around £325 on average, according to uSwitch.

Plus these are the tariffs which energy suppliers can hike costs on.

The Big Six's grip on the energy market is slowly beginning to loosen as more and more households ditch them for smaller suppliers.

These energy minnows now dominate the best-buy tables as well as often offering better service.

And you might be surprised by how simple the switching process can actually be.

Those on the hunt for a better deal have heaps of choice - whether it is a long-term fix, variable rate or tariff from a smaller or green supplier you are looking for.

Although the savings from switching are not quite as big as they were a few years ago, switching should remain a key part of your personal finance maintenance.

If you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you could also save a big chunk of cash.

Could you cut your energy bills... or help the planet and go green? Millions of people could be needlessly overpaying for their energy as they fail to switch to providers who offer cheaper deal. They may also be missing out on the opportunity to help the planet and fight climate change, by switching to green deals that offer electricity from renewable sources and more environmentally-friendly gas. With our partner, Compare the Market, you can compare energy tariffs and exclusive deals. Why not find out if you could save hundreds of pounds a year on your energy or go green? >> Check to see if you can start saving money now

Things to remember

Your bill will show two costs - a fixed standing rate charge and the price per unit (or Kwh of energy used).

Online plans paid by direct debit are still the most competitively priced and if you have never switched, choosing one of these will save you the most money.

You can either opt for a variable rate tariff, where the price can go up or down or a fixed rate tariff which gives you a secure price on each unit of electricity you use for a set period.

Savings: tricks and traps 1) Regular meter readings: Make sure you check every time you receive a bill, rather than relying on an estimate by your energy provider's estimate. 2) Change to online bills: You could save up to 10 per cent. 3) Avoid prepayment meters if you can, and swap to a billed meter. Even if you have to pay to get one, it's probably worth it for the savings you'll gain. 4) If you're in financial trouble some companies offer special deals, which help ease any difficulties you might be facing. But don't just assume this will be the cheapest option - make sure you still do your homework. 5) Dual fuel (gas and electricity from the same supplier) is not always the cheapest option. 6) Monthly direct debit payments could save you 5 to 10 per cent as companies are more confident that customers won't default and earn interest on any over payments. Check any extra payments are refunded at the end of the year. 7) Swot up on how to lower your energy use: This guide gives you a few top tips to help you save more money by cutting your gas and electricity use

Happy birthday! Rumer Willis celebrated her 33rd birthday on Monday by sharing a treasure trove of throwback snaps, including some capturing her parents Demi Moore and Bruce Willis

The slideshow started off with a snap of Demi as a young mother, holding her newborn daughter while flashing a silly expression towards the camera.

A slew of other childhood photos followed, including one of baby Rumer sitting next to her father on the couch as he folded his arms across his chest.

There is also a sweet shot of Rumer as a young girl pampering herself with a facial and hair curlers.

Demi married Bruce in 1987 after they meet at the premiere for the film Stakeout, which starred Demi's then-fiancé Emilio Estevezand.

The Die Hard star and Moore welcomed three daughters: Rumer in 1988, Scout in 1991, and Tallulah in 1994.

The pair have managed to stay close after ending their marriage in 2000.

The Ghost star was previously married to singer Freddy Moore from 1981 to 1985.

She also married actor Ashton Kutcher in 2005 before splitting in 2011. Their divorce was finalised in 2013.

And on Sunday, Nicole Scherzinger put on an eye-catching display in a flowing paisley-printed dress while arriving at Jennifer Klein's Day of Indulgence event in Brentwood.

The Pussycat Dolls member, 43, was seen flashing a wide smile as exited a private vehicle and made her way towards the star-studded function.

Dressed to impress: Nicole Scherzinger put on an eye-catching display while wearing a vibrantly colored outlet while arriving at the Jennifer Klein Day of Indulgence event in Brentwood on Sunday

Scherzinger sported a vibrantly colored and sleeved dress that featured lovely paisley and floral patterns to the event.

Her beautiful dark brunette locks added an element of darkness to her otherwise vibrant ensemble.

The entertainer also sported a light pair of platform shoes and a near-matching wide-brimmed hat to the function.

She accessorized with numerous articles of jewelry, including a stylish pair of tinted sunglasses.

Accessorizing well: The Pussycat Dolls member sported numerous articles of jewelry that added a bit of shine to her clothing ensemble

Dressed for the weather: The performer also wore a stylish pair of tinted sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat

Scherzinger kept a small crossbody leather purse slung over her left shoulder for the duration of her time in public.

The party, which is thrown annually by producer Jennifer Klein, is a regular retreat for the A-listers and a chance for them to take in some pleasurable pampering.

The ultra-wealthy actresses and entertainers each are given a variety of expensive swag for free, and several stars were spotted pushing out massive Samsonite suitcases, which InStyle reported could be filled with as much as 80lbs of goodies.

The event seems to be quite the afternoon of fun as guests are treated to food and beverages as different parts of the property make for different experiences including a free outdoor swag bazaar in the backyard and pop-up boutiques in rooms that include a mix of shopping and gifting.

The celebrities can then end the day relaxing by the pool where there are spa treatments available.

Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Rodrigo, Christina Hendricks and Alexandra Daddario, were just a few of the major celebrities seen at the event.

Cream of the crop: Jennifer Lopez, 52, joined her 13-year-old daughter Emme for some pampering on Sunday at Jennifer Klein's Day of Indulgence party in Los Angeles with a bevy of A-listers

Packed: Jennifer and Emme were spotted as they walked up to Klein's house from the street, which was crowded with cars dropping off attendees

Seasonally appropriate: The Out Of Sight star rocked a playful summery ensemble featuring a skimpy pale lavender tube top that put the spotlight on her washboard abs, which she proudly displayed

This is the 23rd year for the unmissable event, which continued last year despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

At that event, attendance was limited compared to previous years, and guests were required to be masked and to social distance at all times.

It's unclear if the guests list was curtailed again for 2021, though several guests were still seen wearing masks at various times.

It's considerably safer this year even with many people going unmasked, as many of the attendees are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

JLo, 52, certainly had all eyes on her as she arrived with her 13-year-old daughter Emme.

Towering: The Driver's License hitmaker stood tall in black platform boots and wore slim sunglasses while tying her hair back

Future project: Scherzinger is currently set to appear in the forthcoming musical special, Annie Live!; she is seen in February

Tony Award-winning choreographer Sergio Trujillo will plan out the event's dance scenes.

Taraji P. Henson is currently set to play the villainous Miss Hannigan, and her casting was announced in June.

That same month, Harry Connick, Jr. signed on to portray Daddy Warbucks in the forthcoming special.

Scherzinger's casting was announced earlier this month, and she gave a statement to Deadline to express her excitement for being involved with the project.

Impressive cast: Taraji P. Henson and Harry Connick Jr were also added to the forthcoming feature's list of performers; the former is seen in 2020

'Musical theater has always made my heart soar, so I'm over the moon to join this amazing cast for such a great classic,' she said.

Titus Burgess was recently added to the cast, and he will play Rooster Hannigan.

The actress who will fill the role of the show's titular character has not been announced as of yet.

Annie Live! is currently set to have its official premiere on NBC on December 2nd.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Future, the owner of magazines including Country Life and Wallpaper, has snapped up Dennis, the publisher of titles including MoneyWeek and The Week, in a £300million deal.

FTSE 250-listed Future, which also owns TechRadar and football magazine FourFourTwo, is buying Dennis Publishing from Exponent, a UK-based private equity firm.

The deal is the latest acquisition by Britain's biggest magazine publisher, which last year bought price comparison website GoCompare for £594million.

Future will be the new owner of current affairs magazine The Week in the UK and US

The news sent shares in Future rising 7.5 per cent to £39.63 in late afternoon trading on Monday.

Under the deal, Future is adding a number of titles to its stable, including the adult and junior versions of current affairs magazine The Week in the UK and US, MoneyWeek, Kiplinger, Science & Nature, IT Pro, Computer Active, PC Pro, Minecraft World, and Coach.

However, Exponent, which acquired Dennis in 2018 for £166million, will hold on to some titles, including Viz, Fortean Times, Cyclist and Expert Reviews.

Future said the move will help to expand its reach in the US, where 56 per cent of Dennis revenues are currently generated.

Under the leadership of Zillah Byng-Thorne, Future has expanded rapidly into a digitally-led media business and launched a series of daring takeovers.

Earlier this year, it bought Mozo, an Australian price comparison website that focuses on selling financial products like loans and bank accounts, for £17million.

Last year, it snapped up TI Media - which publishes 40 titles including Horse & Hound, Woman & Home and Wallpaper - in a a £140million deal.

Buying spree: Future's latest deal comes after last year's acquisition of GoCompare for £594m

'I am delighted to announce the acquisition of a high-quality portfolio of Dennis' trusted brands that will accelerate our strategy, enhance our content capabilities and bring additional geographical and vertical revenue diversification, whilst materially increasing the proportion of recurring revenues across the group,' Byng-Thorne said.

James Tye, chief executive at Dennis, said: 'In the three years that the business has been owned by Exponent, Dennis has been on an incredible growth journey, delivering double-digit increases in subscription revenues, a greatly increased US footprint, and significant bottom-line increases.

'This is a testament to the talented team at Dennis who have helped make all of this happen.'

Georgia admitted that while she 'cried' upon seeing her stretch marks after the birth, she now feels 'proud' at having grown a beauty healthy baby', and encouraged other mothers to not feel pressure in 'bouncing back' quickly.

'THE REALITY.. all I heard when I was pregnant was 'you'll bounce back, you're young" etc. It got in my head and I probably did think I would to an extent,' Georgia began.

'So you can imagine the first time I looked in the mirror eight weeks ago, I'm not going to lie.. I freaked out, my body wasn't my body I was used to no more. I had big stretch marks, I am wider and obviously a c-section scar, I remember just crying.'

Georgia went on to reveal how she's now feeling 'proud' at what her body has achieved, nearly two months after giving birth.

'NOW eight weeks on this is me, I've done no exercise and ate what I want, when I can. I now look at my body and I'm proud. I'm proud I have grown a beautiful healthy baby, I'm proud I have got through the first eight weeks,' she said.

She went on to say that while she would love to fit into her size 10 Zara clothing, she's giving herself 'minimum a year' to drop the pounds as she's focusing on herself and her baby.

From baby bump to baby Brody! The post comes after Georgia and her millionaire beau Tommy Mallet the first trailer for their new spin-off show showing new family life

Honest: Tommy is heard admitting 'this is pretty daunting' and that this 'it's an emotional rollercoaster' in the trailer

The reality star urged society to 'stop using these phrases' of bounce back for women, and encouraged other mothers to not feel any additional pressure.

'It's taken us nine months to grow a baby, why are we expecting our bumps to go straight away? Let's just encourage mum to look after themselves, their mental health and their babies.

'Let's stop adding more pressure on women, it's hard enough!' she continued.

Georgia and Tommy are now set to share their pregnancy and first weeks as parents with fans in a spin-off show.

In a first look trailer for the upcoming two-part special, called Georgia & Tommy Baby Steps, the couple are seen preparing to welcome their son in hospital and sweetly joking that the little one takes after his dad.

Lucie revealed the daily death threats were from the same accounts each day and the comments made her feel nervous enough to contact the police.

Burying the hatchet: Linda Evangelista battled with French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault over child support with regards to their son Augustin back in 2012. But these days, it seems Evangelista only has love for her ex and his wife Salma Hayek, it would appear

Sweet: On Saturday, Hayek, 54, posted a family snap of herself out with Pinault's 14-year-old son to her Instagram page, and Evangelista, 54 reacted with joy - posting two black heart emojis in the comment section

In the cute snap, Augustin, who is clad in a grey t-shirt and a black Anaheim Angels baseball cap, is grinning broadly as Salma peeks out behind him with a wide smile.

'Here comes the weekend!! Viva el fin de semana!!! #tgif #weekendvibes,' she wrote in the caption of the photo, which was taken on a boat.

The Frida star announced that she was engaged to Pinault in March 2007 and also confirmed that she was pregnant. Hayek gave birth to their daughter, Valentina Paloma in September 2007.

Friendly: The Academy Award nominee appears to have a good relationship with her stepchildren. Last Thursday, Salma shared a photo in which she was seen on vacation with Pinault and Matilde

The Mexican actress and the Kering CEO tied the knot in a lavish ceremony on Valentine's Day in 2008. The pair, who reportedly met at a party in Venice later renewed their vows in the romantic Italian city.

Francois-Henri shares a son, Francois, 23, and a daughter Matilde, 20, with his ex-wife Dorothée Lepère. The Academy Award nominee appears to have a good relationship with her stepchildren. Last Thursday, Salma shared a photo in which she was seen on vacation with Pinault and Matilde.

In October 2006, Linda gave birth to Augustin but refused to name the baby's father. She later referred to him as a 'New York architect.' In June 2011, the Canadian supermodel filed court papers and stated that Pinault was Augustin's father.

Evangelista and Henri-Francois had dated for four months in 2005 and early 2006, a few months before he met Salma. In August 2011, Linda officially filed for child support, initially asking for $46,000 a month.

The staggering sum even shocked the judge, who said it would be 'the largest support order in the history of the Family Court.' In May 2012, a heavily publicized court battle ensued in which both parties revealed sordid details about their relationship.

Pinault said that he broke up with Evangelista upon learning she was pregnant and asserted that they had only spent seven days together during their short-lived romance. Linda's lawyer claimed that the billionaire asked her to terminate the pregnancy.

A few days into the trial, the two reached an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed amount. At the time, they said in a statement, 'We are happy that we were able to reach an agreement for the benefit and well-being of our son, Augie.'
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sub-prime lender Provident Financial saw its statutory losses swell to £44.2million in the first six months of this year.

But, excluding its consumer credit division, the group's adjusted profit jumped to £63.5million, up from £4.9million the year before.

Over four million customers of the lender can start claiming compensation after the High Court gave the green light to the group's repayment plan last week.

Results: Sub-prime lender Provident Financial saw its statutory losses swell to £44.2m in the first six months of this year

Affected Provident customers who were sold unaffordable loans by the sub-prime lender will need to register via an online portal in order to kick off their compensation claims.

Applications for compensation must be made within a six-month period.

The compensation scheme applies to borrowers who were sold unaffordable loans between 6 April 2007 and 17 December 2020 from one of Provident's personal credit brands.

They are doorstep lender Provident, Satsuma payday loans, Greenwood, which was a doorstep lender that has been defunct since 2014, and Glo, which is a guarantor loan brand.

Shares in Provident, which is listed on the London Stock Market, are currently up 1.56 per cent or 4.80p to 312.00p. A year ago the share price was 195.80p, meaning it has risen by nearly 60 per cent in the past year.

The group said it would not be declaring a dividend payout to shareholders for the first half, 'as the focus remains on preserving capital during the period of closure of the Consumer Credit Division business.'

It added: 'The group will revisit its policy at the year end, allowing time for the board to assess the impact of the end of furlough, and any future lockdown restrictions, on the group’s customers.'

The company's credit card and personal loans arm, Vanquis Bank, reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of £57.1million in the first half, up from £11.8million at the same point last year.

The group said the profit at Vanquis was 'driven by lower impairments as a result of more favourable macroeconomic conditions.' But, new customer numbers in this arm stood at 97,000 over the period, down from 147,000 a year ago.

The group's vehicle finance business, Moneybarn, delivered an adjusted pre-tax profit for the period of £15.5million, up from £2.3million at the same point in 2020.

This was 'driven by higher revenue year-on-year, as a result of the growth in the receivables book, and lower impairment,' Provident said.

Payment holiday take-up by Moneybarn customers has been 'extremely low' and ended the period at just 0.1 per cent of customers, down from 3.5 per cent last year, it said.

Malcolm Le May, the group's chief executive, said today: 'The first six months of 2021 showed a marked contrast to the extremely difficult conditions seen throughout 2020.

'Underlying customer trends and macroeconomic conditions have improved year-on-year, allowing us to focus on the core businesses, which is reflected in our results.'

Payouts: Over 4million Provident Financial customers can now apply for compensation

He added: 'In March, we notified the market of our intention to launch a Scheme of Arrangement for CCD and in May, regrettably, we took the difficult decision to place the business into a managed run-off.

'I am pleased that the proposed Scheme of Arrangement for CCD, which was provided for in our 2020 accounts, was sanctioned by the High Court on 4 August.

'We can now continue to move forwards with our plans to close the business before paying customer redress claims during 2022.

'During the remainder of 2021, PFG will accelerate its transition towards becoming the leading specialist bank focused on financially underserved customers, serving growing market segments with a range of mid-cost products across credit cards, vehicle finance and unsecured personal loans.'

In March, Provident announced its Consumer Credit Division's scheme of arrangement, and in May it announced the closure and managed wind down of the division.

Provident wrote to 4.3million of its former and current customers, telling them that its consumer credit division could collapse into administration unless they agreed to a sharp reduction in compensation payments for mis-selling.

Doorstep lending is a form of high-cost, short-term credit where payments are collected at the borrowers' home.

Provident has now set aside £50million in order to meet the compensation claims of affected borrowers mis-sold loans by the company.

But, affected customers will not be receiving all their money back after the company warned that full compensation payments would force it to go bust leaving many affected with nothing at all.

Matt has previously spoken about his pal's relationship, as he told Extra last month he was 'so happy' for the couple amid their rekindled romance.

He said at the time: 'He's the best. He deserves every happiness in the world. I'm glad for both of them.'

Meanwhile, it was recently reported 52-year-old Jennifer – who previously dated Ben between 2002 and 2004 – is 'fully committed' to Ben, but they aren't planning on getting married.

A source told E! recently: 'They are fully committed to each other... They have been meshing their lives and families and don't feel the need to get engaged yet or even tie the knot.

'They have both been there and don't feel it's necessary. They are both very secure within their relationship and Ben worships her. It's truly meant to be and everyone around them thinks they are a perfect match.'

However, the pair are likely to move in together soon, and the couple have been spotted house hunting together in recent months.

Back on! The couple have recently reconciled, 17 years after calling off their engagement (pictured July 2021 in Los Angeles)

The couple were photographed this past week touring Bob Hope's $40 million Toluca Lake estate, fueling rumors that the singer is looking to relocate to the West Coast from Miami, Florida for the actor.

They were reportedly touring the five-acre property once belonging to the famous British-American comedian at around 11:30AM, and spent an hour there.

An insider told ET Online last month that their 'friends wouldn't be surprised if they move in together and ultimately end up together. They're spending all of their free time together and making each other a priority.'

Ben has three children - Violet, 15, Seraphina, 12, and Samuel, nine – with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, whilst Jennifer has 13-year-old twins Emme and Max with her ex-husband Marc Anthony.

Today's loosening of 'pingdemic' isolation rules is unlikely to cause Covid cases to spiral because the public will remain careful, one of the Government's scientific advisers has claimed.

Professor Stephen Reicher, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews and member of SAGE's behavioural sub-committee, said he was a 'relative optimist' about the relaxation and the next phase of Britain's coronavirus battle.

From today, millions of fully-jabbed people in England and Northern Ireland will not have to endure the misery of a 10-day isolation if they are 'pinged' by the NHS app or contacted by Test and Trace. It brings both nations in line with Scotland and Wales and marks one of the biggest steps on the road back to normality.

Asked about whether the move could spark a rise in infections, Professor Reicher told BBC Radio 4's Today show: 'After the reopening on July 19, many of us thought infections would go up massively to 50,000 or 100,000 a day. Perhaps they still will — but they didn't.

'One of the major reasons why they didn't was the good sense of the public — people remained cautious, people remained careful, so I have a fair amount of faith in the good sense and the caution of the public.'

But 'Professor Lockdown' Neil Ferguson, another one of No10's Covid scientists whose modelling has influenced draconian measures, warned it was still 'possible' cases could hit 100,000 a day this winter.

There are fears that infections could start to spiral again now that isolation rules are being relaxed, the country is moving into the colder months and schools are preparing to go back.

The Imperial College London epidemiologist admitted he was not certain about what will happen to cases in the coming months, claiming: 'I've learnt my lesson in terms of being over-eager at making those sorts of predictions.'

Professor Ferguson was heavily criticised for claiming it was 'almost inevitable' cases would rise above 100,000 — possibly as high as 200,000 — after Freedom Day in July. In reality, there are now just 28,000 cases every day, on average.

Professor Stephen Reicher (left), a psychologist at the University of St Andrews and member of SAGE's bevaioural sub-committee, said he was a 'relative optimist' about the relaxation and the next phase of Britain's coronavirus battle. But 'Professor Lockdown' Neil Ferguson, another one of No10's Covid scientists whose modelling has influenced draconian measures, warned it was still 'possible' cases could hit 100,000 a day this winter.

At the worst of the 'pingdemic', more than 1.5million people were isolating per week. That number has come down to more than 700,000 in recent weeks

How have the requirements changed? As of today, the double-jabbed and under-18s are no longer legally required to isolate for ten days if they come into close contact with someone who has Covid Instead, they will be 'advised' by the NHS Covid-19 app to take a free PCR test And if the PCR test comes back positive, they will have to quarantine at home for ten days The exemption applies to those who received their second dose at least 14 days before coming into contact with a positive case Fully vaccinated adults who were recently 'pinged' can leave isolation early today Anyone who can show they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons is also eligible to escape from quarantine Advertisement

The SAGE modeller also warned of the potential of 'quite a large wave' in September and October when children return to school.

And he said hospital admissions of 1,000 a day, a fraction of levels seen during the darkest days of the pandemic, would 'stress' the fragile NHS, which already has 'very long backlogs'.

However, he admitted ministers wouldn't necessarily need a lockdown to stop the next wave. Professor Ferguson added: 'What it will stop with is the acquisition of immunity in the population, so it will naturally decline and that's the point where we start living with Covid where it becomes an endemic disease.'

Today's rule change also applies to under-18s, who will no longer need to isolate if they are identified as a close contact of a Covid patient.

The Health Secretary said the successful vaccine rollout has allowed the Government to ease rules that have forced millions to quarantine at home, devastating businesses and schools.

Scientists, including Professor Reicher, have warned that, as the double-vaccinated can still catch and pass on Covid, today's relaxation of the rules will inevitably lead to more infections.

But exactly how much of an effect this will have on the UK's situation is still not known.

Professor Ferguson was asked whether it was possible daily cases could rise to six figures in the winter — after the modeller wrongly forecasted 100,000 infections every day this summer.

He told the Today programme: 'It's possible. It's very hard to make those predictions at the minute. What we can be confident in is vaccination protecting people against the most severe disease.'

Asked what an 'acceptable' level of transmission would look like moving forward, the epidemiologist added: 'We have a parallel with influenza pandemics, and we get them very episodically and we end up living with that virus as seasonal flu.

'And so, I think we still could see quite substantial transmission in the autumn coming up to the winter but predicting further than that is very difficult.

'We don't know how much the virus will continue to change and evolve and that is probably the most important determinant of how much infection we get in the future. Of course, how much we can live with is a societal and political judgement as much as a medical one.'

Professor Reicher and others have warned that the Delta variant has 'changed the equitation' because of its ability to infect vaccinated people, who are also susceptible to spreading the virus — even though they are mostly immune from serious illness.

UK's vaccine mega-factory will combine Covid and flu jab into single shot Covid and flu vaccines will be mixed into one injection to save time and make future booster programmes more convenient at one of the UK's mega vaccine factories. Dr Matthew Duchars, chief executive officer of the Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), claimed the facility in Oxfordshire is looking into whether a single jab can be used to immunise against both viruses. Minister have not yet confirmed booster jabs will be given this autumn, with No10 waiting on advice from its expert panel before pressing ahead with plans. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said last week that the UK 'will be able to start the booster programme' from next month, if the Government is given the green light. Up to 32million over-50s could be invited for top-up jabs, which may be dished out at the same time as the annual flu vaccine. Whitehall sources said the plan this autumn is to administer Covid and flu jabs at the same time in different arms. But Dr Duchars told the Telegraph that the VMIC was looking at combining the two for future roll-outs. He said: 'It will save a lot of time and it would be a lot more convenient to just give one shot, so it is something that we and vaccine developers and producers will be looking at. 'Let's say we do need to give a seasonal vaccine, and people need one shot for flu, and one shot for Covid and another for something else. 'If you can put them all into one, then that's obviously preferable.' Advertisement

Professor Reicher added: 'Vaccines are wonderful and if you read the government website about the changes in the rules, it's like a hymn of praise to the vaccine.

'And we should indeed be grateful – but they're not perfect and you're not invulnerable if you're double-vaccinated, there's still a fairly good chance you could get infected and infect others.

'Whereas, previously, there was a one in ten chance if you were infected you'd be hospitalised. It went down to about 2 per cent but it has recently risen a bit to about 3 per cent.

'But there's still a danger of hospitalisation, so if enough people get infected it can still be serious. So the first message you need to give people is: be careful, infections matter.'

While Professor Reicher said he had faith that the British public would remain diligent, he admitted he would have preferred if fully-jabbed people were still required to take a PCR test if they are pinged.

Currently, Government advice is for inoculated patients to book a swab if they are identified as a close contact but the recommendation is not legally binding.

Professor Reicher added: 'While it's true that you don't have to self-isolate, the other side of the equation is still there is very strong advice to get a PCR test to find out whether you're infected or not, and I think that's really important to stress because I think one of the issues here is clear messaging about what you should do.

'That is a problem. But at the same time, it's important in terms of the messaging that the public understands that it is strong advice. I wish it was stronger, I wish there was a requirement to get a PCR test. But at least there's strong advice and let's not forget that.'

The NHS app was launched in September last year and it tells users if their smartphones have been near someone who has tested positive for Covid. But as lockdown eased and the Delta variant spread, the app led to the chaos that was dubbed the pingdemic.

In the week to July 21, a record 689,313 people in England and Wales were told to isolate. The pingdemic caused such huge staff shortages – leading to empty shop shelves and cancelled trains – that the Government had to exempt key workers from the rules, including those in the food industry and working on public transport.

Under huge pressure, ministers then announced that the legal requirement to isolate would be removed for under-18s and adults who have had both doses of the Covid vaccine.

From today, double-jabbed app users identified as close contacts of someone with Covid will be advised to take a free NHS PCR test – and they must isolate if that comes back positive.

Hannah Essex, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said many businesses will be 'relieved' about the change to the rules.

But Dr Louise Soanes, of the charity Teenage Cancer Trust, said vulnerable youngsters are 'at greater risk of serious illness if they get the virus' and those who are double-vaccinated should still take precautions if they are pinged.

Self-care Sunday: Olivia Rodrigo, 18, rocked a colorful patterned top and a black mini skirt as she arrived at Jennifer Klein's Day of Indulgence party in Los Angeles on Sunday

The 5ft5in hitmaker matched her skirt with a cool pair of tall black platform boots.

She wore her brunette tresses parted down the middle and tied back in a low-slung bun.

She kept red-tinted slim sunglasses on hand to block out the sun, and she wore a surgical-style mask to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Olivia also accessorized with a fuzzy leopard-print handbag, and she was seen leaving the party with several bags of swag.

Her friend walked arm-in-arm with her as they arrived and then again as they departed the party.

She wore a pink blouse with black trim, plus a tan mini skirt, golden boots and a fuzzy bucket hat.

The party, which is thrown annually by Klein, a film and television producer, is a regular retreat for A-listers and a chance for them to take in some pleasurable pampering.

The ultra-wealthy actresses and entertainers each are given a variety of expensive swag for free, and several stars were spotted pushing out massive Samsonite suitcases, which InStyle reported could be filled with as much as 80lbs of goodies.

In addition to the suitcases, the guests received a LeSportSac weekenders bag with items specially tailored for each individual guest.

The event seems to be quite the afternoon of fun as guests are treated to food and beverages as different parts of the property make for different experiences including a free outdoor swag bazaar in the backyard and pop-up boutiques in rooms that include a mix of shopping and gifting.

The celebrities can then end the day relaxing by the pool where there are spa treatments available.

Among the high-profile crowd were Jennifer Lopez and her daughter Emme, Alexandra Daddario, Tyra Banks, Tessa Thompson, Leslie Mann and many others.

Stepping on toes: Recently, Olivia has been involved in a spat with rocker Courtney Love after the grunge singer alleged that Olivia had ripped off the cover of her classic 1994 album Live Through This, recorded by her band Hole

Recently, Olivia has been involved in a spat with rocker Courtney Love after the grunge singer alleged that Olivia had ripped off the cover of her classic 1994 album Live Through This, recorded by her band Hole.

The Bizaardvark star released a cover image for her virtual concert Sour Prom which featured her dressed in a prom dress with a tiara on her head, a bouquet of flowers in her arms and mascara running down her face from crying.

Fans noticed the similarity between the image and the cover of Courtney's album, which also featured a teary prom queen, though the angles and framing were different.

After the publicity image was released, Courtney posted Olivia's photo to her own Instagram, captioning it: 'spot the difference! #twinning!'

Olivia took the post as a compliment and replied: 'love u and live through this sooooo much.'

Courtney replied: 'Olivia — you're welcome. My favorite florist is in Notting Hill, London! Dm me for deets! I look forward to reading your note!'

Though seemingly polite, she seemed to imply that Olivia owed her some flowers for the photo.

She made it clear she was at least partly miff when a fan asked if she was 'mad or nah,' and she remarked that Olivia 'didn't ask.'

'So bit of both. I dig manners.'

''I mean, to be honest I’m flattered that Courtney Love knows who I am,' she said.

She continued: 'She’s from a totally different generation, so I thought that was cool, but I think we’re both obviously really inspired by the film Carrie. I don’t know — I didn’t really give it too much thought.'

She had plenty of designer digs including a small black leather quilted pouch and a large black and white Fendi bag.

Laverne's highlighted blonde locks were worn down in a middle-part as they flowed over her shoulder.

The party, which is thrown annually by producer Jennifer Klein, is a regular retreat for the A-listers and a chance for them to take in some pleasurable pampering.

The ultra-wealthy actresses and entertainers each are given a variety of expensive swag for free, and several stars were spotted pushing out massive Samsonite suitcases, which InStyle reported could be filled with as much as 80lbs of goodies.

The event seems to be quite the afternoon of fun as guests are treated to food and beverages as different parts of the property make for different experiences including a free outdoor swag bazaar in the backyard and pop-up boutiques in rooms that include a mix of shopping and gifting.

The celebrities can then end the day relaxing by the pool where there are spa treatments available.

Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Rodrigo, Christina Hendricks and Alexandra Daddario, were just a few of the major celebrities seen at the event.

Cream of the crop: Jennifer Lopez, 52, joined her 13-year-old daughter Emme for some pampering on Sunday at Jennifer Klein's Day of Indulgence party in Los Angeles with a bevy of A-listers

Packed: Jennifer and Emme were spotted as they walked up to Klein's house from the street, which was crowded with cars dropping off attendees

It's unclear if the guests list was curtailed again for 2021, though several guests were still seen wearing masks at various times.

It's considerably safer this year even with many people going unmasked, as many of the attendees are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

JLo, 52, certainly had all eyes on her as she arrived with her 13-year-old daughter Emme.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Parcel and package delivery scams are the most common type of 'smishing' text messages, new data has revealed.

Smishing is a technique that criminals use to target consumers with texts impersonating trusted organisations.

These text messages often contain a link to a fraudulent website that replicates a legitimate site, asking the victim to enter personal and financial information.

Now research has found that, over a 90-day period, the number of scam texts pretending to be from a delivery firm represented more than half of all smishing attempts, according to new data provided to UK Finance by cybersecurity company Proofpoint.

Example of a scam text message where fraudsters try to get customers to click on link

Each year within the UK, millions of people report text messages as spam with Proofpoint operating the 7726 text message system on behalf of mobile phone operators, which allows customers to report suspicious texts.

The numbers 7726 on a keypad spell out the word 'SPAM'.

UK Finance revealed that, aside from parcel delivery smishing scams, those pretending to be from a bank or other financial institution represent around a third of texts.

During the recent 30-day period however, the proportion of delivery scam texts has increased significantly and represents three times the number of those pretending to be from a bank.

Some 67.4 per cent of smishing campaigns were parcel and package delivery texts in the past 30 days whilst just 22.6 per cent were purporting to be from other financial institutions and banks.

Other smishing attacks made up 9.6 per cent whilst Government Entity scams made up just 0.4 per cent.

This includes criminals posing as organisations such as HMRC and DWP.

Malicious texts are often part of a wider scam. If someone clicks on a link and provides information, they may then get a phone call from someone claiming to be from their bank.

Exploiting the personal and financial information provided in the text message, the person offers to help safeguard funds by trying to convince someone to transfer money into a 'safe account', which is in fact an account run by the same criminal that sent the original text message.

Reports to the 7726 system are being used by the National Cyber Security Centre to take down fraudulent website URLs and prevent further fraud losses.

The data shown in the table below covers those categorised as smishing for the 30 and 90-day periods to mid-July.

TOP SMISHING CAMPAIGNS AS OF 14 JULY 2021 30 days 90 days Parcel and Package Delivery 67.4% 53.2% Financial Institutions and Banks 22.6% 36.8% Other smishing attacks 9.6% 8.9% Government Entities 0.4% 1.1% Source: UK Finance by cybersecurity company Proofpoint

Katy Worobec, Managing Director of Economic Crime at UK Finance, said: 'Criminals are experts at impersonating a range of organisations and have capitalised on the pandemic, knowing that many of us will be ordering goods online and awaiting parcel deliveries at home.

'We are urging people to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign and to always stop and think whenever you get a text message out of the blue before parting with your information or money.

'Always avoid clicking on links in a text message in case it's a scam and forward any suspected scam text messages to 7726 so that the criminals responsible can be brought to justice.'

Take Five to Stop Fraud urges people to remember the Stop, Challenge, Protect behaviours and to recognise that criminals are experts at impersonating people, organisations and the police.

Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell, added: 'Scammers have homed in on the massive surge in everyone shopping online while they were stuck at home in lockdown and are using it for their gain.

'But even now lockdown has eased, the scammers are showing no signs of easing up. Once the scammer has got your initial details they'll usually contact you for more information, involving transferring cash from your bank account – with many people losing their life savings this way.

'Last year scammers stole £479million from unsuspecting people through these scams, with the actual figure likely to be a lot higher as much of it goes unreported.

'Everyone thinks they are smart enough to spot a scam text, but the messages have become so sophisticated that it's easy to be caught out.

'Lots of people will also see the text when they are in a hurry to receive their package or are rushing, so won't stop to think about whether it's legitimate or not.

Those who receive such texts are advised to take a moment & check if it is real before replying

'The best thing you can do is stop to consider the message or show it to a friend or family member – better to get a package late if the message is genuine than get caught up in a scam.'

Text and email scams have been rife in recent times with many fraudsters taking advantage of the pandemic.

This is Money has previously reported that consumers were falling victim to a Post Office scam when people were sent emails asking them to send a payment to release packages.

Screenshots of the email show the fraudsters telling the recipient there is a parcel waiting for them but they must pay a shipping cost before it can be delivered.

A link is then attached which, if clicked on/and or completed, could put consumers at risk of fraud.

Those who are expecting packages are most likely to be tricked while it appears scammers have wised up to the fact some delivery firms do ask for extra fees to be paid in order to release items.

Parcel delivery payments have also become a recent issue with consumers finding themselves falling foul of delivery companies for other reasons.

This is Money has reported that many UPS consumers are being told they must pay high delivery fees to receive items from overseas.

Our investigation revealed that many of these fees were not correct with some customers overcharged by hundreds of pounds.

Meanwhile, courier behaviour has been criticised by Citizens Advice which recently called for fines for delivery companies after saying the way parcels are delivered is not fit for purpose.

It said, despite a large number of people not receiving their deliveries, the majority of couriers receive no penalty for lost or stolen deliveries.

How to protect yourself from smishing scams

• Remember that criminals will send out smishing text messages with links leading to fake websites used to steal personal and financial information.

These text messages may appear to be from trusted organisations and may use official branding to convince you they're genuine. Always access websites by typing them into the web browser and avoid clicking on links in texts.

• Remain vigilant and check delivery notifications very carefully to ensure they are genuine. Text messages may look very similar to those that are genuine but may use generic greetings, such as Dear Sir/Madam, or include spelling errors.

• Always question claims that you are due goods or services that you haven't ordered or are unaware of, especially if you have to pay any fees upfront.

• Customers can report suspected scam texts to their mobile network provider by forwarding them to 7726 which spells 'SPAM' on your telephone keypad.

The England footballer, 25, currently in a relationship with model Sasha Attwood, also 25, showed his appreciation for Casa Amor bombshell Lillie's glamorous photos by liking the snaps from his verified profile.

Lillie, 22, was flattered after noting the likes from Jack on her pictures, including one of her wearing a skimpy white bikini that was shared days after she entered the rival Love Island villa.

'Flattered': Manchester City's £100m man Jack Grealish liked a string of Love Island star Lillie Haynes' sexy bikini pictures on Instagram before swiftly removing the interaction days later

A source told MailOnline: 'Lillie couldn't believe Jack even knows who she is, let alone took the time to like her uploads on Instagram.

'It was disappointing he unliked the photos days later, but it's possible he didn't want his girlfriend finding out.

'She was complimented nonetheless, and hopes one day they'll cross paths so she can ask him about it.'

The footballer liked a photo of Lillie in a bikini that was shared while she was in Casa Amor on July 26, as well as a snap of the reality star enjoying a glass of bubbles to celebrate her 'freedom' after returning from Mallorca and quarantining for five days.

MailOnline has contacted Jack and Lillie's representatives for comment.

Jack, who completed his record British transfer from Aston Villa earlier this month, recently admitted he's a 'big fan' of Love Island, even saying if he wasn't a footballer, he'd be a contestant on the ITV2 dating show.

In April, Jack joked during an interview alongside ex-Villa teammate John McGinn, 26, he'd be 'on Love Island or working as a promotor or DJ' if he failed as a sportsman.

He also shared an image of him and the England lads watching Love Island on a large screen in a communal room inside the team's Euro accommodation last month and joked dumped Islander Hugo Hammond, 25, looked like the spit of defender Ben White, 23.

Jack has previously shown his admiration for former Love Island contestants, after he was caught hitting on reality star Natalia Zoppa, 22, by her boyfriend.

In a video shared on TikTok 2020 Islander Natalia's partner Hass Saleh claimed: 'As if today couldn't get any weirder, the best player in the Premier League tried to chat up missus,' while sharing the alleged Instagram message from Jack, a waving hand emoji.

It was reported in June that Jack and his childhood sweetheart Sasha had got back together following a brief split, and he considered the model his 'secret weapon' off the pitch.

The couple, who were pictured on holiday together in Croatia last month, met while they were teenagers at St Peter's Roman Catholic Secondary School in Solihull, West Midlands.

Lillie found fame on the current series of Love Island when she lured Liam Reardon, 21, away from partner Millie Court, 24, during his stay at Casa Amor.

Millie was faced with Liam's betrayal when she met Lillie for a catch-up arranged by producers, where she didn't hold back on the gory details.

Days later, Millie forgave Liam for passionately kissing Lillie on multiple occasions, with the couple still going strong ahead of the upcoming Love Island final.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Provident Financial has written to former customers telling them to use affordable credit providers and credit unions for future borrowing, as it was rapped by the City watchdog today for its 'arbitrary' mis-selling compensation scheme.

Around 280,000 customers of its closed doorstep lending arm will receive emails today directing them towards the UK's more-than 250 credit unions, and a group of nearly 50 affordable credit providers which are part of membership body Responsible Finance.

These organisations provide credit on more affordable terms than sub-prime lenders like Provident, give clear information about how much repayments will be, and won't lend to customers if they believe they would be over-stretching themselves.

Provident Financial is a personal credit provider headquartered in Bradford, UK

Some also don't give cash loans, instead paying money for essential items - for example washing machines or fridges - direct to the retailer.

Provident's doorstep lending arm went into administration in March and stopped lending on 10 May.

Doorstep lending is a form of high-cost, short-term credit where payments are collected at the borrowers' home.

A spokesperson from Provident said: 'People need access to credit, and we felt informing customers where credit could now be available to them was the right thing to do.'

One of the largest of the affordable providers that the letter signposted, the community interest company Fair for You, warned low-income borrowers to avoid predatory lenders and illegal loan sharks looking to 'make a fast buck off vulnerable families.'

It said they might look to take advantage of sub-prime lenders backing out of the market by targeting their former customers.

James Wilkinson, interim CEO of Fair for You CIC, said: 'We know that millions of people across the UK need to borrow money on a regular basis to buy household essentials and even food.

The chief executive of affordable credit provider Fair for You CIC has warned former customers of doorstep lenders about offers of credit that 'seem too good to be true'

'If you're in this position, please don't be tempted by illegal money lenders, shady individuals or offers that seem too good to be true.

'Make sure anyone you borrow from is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and that there are online reviews or customer testimonials which show that it is trustworthy.'

Provident has said that its doorstep lending business became unprofitable due to the rise of claims management firms submitting thousands of compensation claims for mis-selling.

It made £25million worth of payouts in the second half of 2020, compared with £2.5million in the same period in 2019.

Provident has set aside £50million to compensate customers who were mis-sold loans by its doorstep lending arm under a so-called 'scheme of arrangement'.

Today, the Financial Conduct Authority wrote to Provident to express its disapproval of the scheme, saying it was offering customers less than they were entitled to and describing the £50million contribution as a 'potentially arbitrary figure.'

'Doorstep' lenders are short-term finance providers which collect from borrowers' homes

It said: 'The FCA has significant concerns about schemes of arrangement being used to circumvent paying customers their full redress entitlement in the way proposed by the scheme.'

But despite the FCA's concerns, it said it would not oppose the scheme in court when Provident appears at a sanction hearing on 30 July.

This, it said, was because Provident faces an imminent insolvency where creditors would probably receive even less than they would under the proposed scheme.

The FCA's letter continued: 'The [Provident] Group has stated clearly that it does not intend to increase its contribution or share profits with the redress creditors, such that the redress creditors are left with a 'take it or leave it' choice between a very low recovery under the scheme or a lower recovery (if any) in an insolvency.'

The FCA asked that Provident include its letter in its evidence for the hearing.

Provident chief executive Malcolm Le May said: 'We continue to believe that the scheme is fair and in the best interests of CCD [consumer credit division] customers.'

Provident creditors will vote on whether to approve the scheme on 19 July.

More than 50 per cent will need to vote in favour in order for it to be approved, and their claims must represent at least 75 per cent of the overall value of claims.

Another sub-prime lender, Amigo Loans, had its plans for a compensation scheme which capped payouts for historical complaints rejected by the High Court in May.

It has now said it is at risk of insolvency.
