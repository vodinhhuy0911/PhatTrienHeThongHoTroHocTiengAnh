SOAPS
The Origin of soaps
In the United States, drama series started on the radio in the 1930s. The main audience was women, so many of the advertisements on the progammes were for soap. And at the time, western films were called “Horse Operas”. Soon, people started calling the drama series “Soap Operas”.

The reasons we love soaps
A recent survey asked 300 people why they watched soaps. The most common answers were “They’re relaxing”, “They’re part of my routine”, “I like the characters”. People also said that they had to find out what was happening in their favourite soap. When the Venezualan telenovela, “Kassandra” was on television in Indonesia, the government became worried because some people were taking days off work to watch the programme!
