The American Civil War was fought over 100 years ago. It began in 1861 and lasted until 1865. The American Civil War resulted in the death of eight hundred thousand Americans. What caused this terrible civil war between the North and the South? Now historians believe that there were many causes of the war. One of the important causes of the war was the friction between the North and the South over the issue of slavery. The southern way of life and the southern economy were based on the use of its slave labor. For almost 250 years before the Civil War, the economy of the South depended on the use of black slaves. The slaves were used to plant and pick cotton and tobacco. Cotton and tobacco were the main crops grown in the South. Most Southerners did not think it was wrong to own, buy, or sell black slaves like farm animals. Slavery was, in fact, the foundation of the entire economy and way of life in the South. This was not the situation in the North. The Northern economy did not depend on the use of slave labor. Why not? In the South, there were many large cotton plantations that used hundreds of black slaves. In the North, however, there were smaller farms, and the farmers planted many different kinds of crops, not just cotton or tobacco. Many Northerners were so opposed to slavery that they wanted to end slavery completely, and this attitude made the Southerners angry. Therefore, for many years before the war, there was constant friction between the North and the South over this issue. This friction eventually led to war. The other causes of conflict between the North and the South involved the growth of industry in the North. While the South remained an agricultural area and the North became more and more industrialized. As industry increased in the North, it brought more people and greater wealth to the Northern States. As a result, many Southerners began to fear northern political and economic domination. Because of this fear, many Southerners believed that the South should leave the Union and that they should form their own country. In 1860, the Southerners decided it was time to leave the Union when Abraham Lincoln became president of the United States. Lincoln, as you may know, was against slavery. The people of the South were afraid that their way of life and their economic system were endangered with Lincoln's presidency. Consequently, the Southern States decided to secede from the Union. In other words, they wanted to break away from the North and form a separate country. In 1861, South Carolina seceded, and by June 18th 1861, eleven Southern States had seceded and established a new country. They called the new country the Confederate States of America. The war between the North and the South began when the eleven States seceded from the Union.
