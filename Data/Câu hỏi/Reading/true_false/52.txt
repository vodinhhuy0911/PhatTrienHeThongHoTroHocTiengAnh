Candy and chocolate manufacturers in the UK may have to stop using cartoon characters on their products. Health groups said many food companies use characters from Peppa Pig and Disney on wrappers. The companies do this to get children to buy chocolate and candies. The health groups said 51 percent of products using cartoon characters were bad for children. The products fell below the health requirements needed to advertise on children’s TV shows. They were very high in fat, sugar, and salt. The groups are asking the government to ban the use of these characters to sell unhealthy products to children.
The groups trying to get the ban are Action on Sugar, Action on Salt, and the Children’s Food Campaign. They looked at the nutrition of 526 products. The products’ wrapping had colorful cartoon characters to appeal to children. The Peppa Pig Candy Bites were among the worst products. These contained 99 percent sugar. A nutritionist from the Action on Sugar group, said: “It’s shocking that companies are exploiting the health of our children by using cartoon characters on their high-sugar food and drink products, particularly on chocolates and sweets, which are already hard to resist for children.”
