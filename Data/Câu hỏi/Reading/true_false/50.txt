There is a famous landmark in the desert of central Australia. European explorers saw it for the first time in 1873 and named it Ayers Rock. The original inhabitants of this part of Australia, the Aborigines, call it Uluru. The rock is huge. It is 348 meters high, 3.6 kilometers long and 1.9 kilometers wide. It is a beautiful red-brown color, especially when the sun shines on it early in the morning and in the evening.

When tourists want to visit Uluru, they often start 440 kilometers away in a town called Alice Springs. From there, they organize a camping trip into the desert. People on these trips usually sleep outside under the stars, not in tents, because it’s more exciting. A fire keeps away snakes and other animals during the night. After breakfast, visitors often walk around the base of the rock. This walk is 9.4 kilometers long and takes two hours.

By law, Uluru belongs to the Aborigines and they still use it today for religious ceremonies. Because of this, they ask visitors not to climb it. However, about 100,000 visitors each year ignore this request.
