A BETTER LIFE.
The size of the population is both a strength and a challenge to China. Of the 1.3 billion people, 72 per cent are between the ages of 16 and 64. The movement of people from the countryside to the cities has transformed China into the world's factory floor. In 1978, there were only 172 million urban residents. Now there are 577 million. Social scientists predict that the urban population will be 60 per cent by 2030. Each year about ten million rural Chinese move to the cities, so the factories have a constant supply of labour.
Chinese schools have been very successful. The literacy rate is over 90 per cent. The next step is to develop higher education. Many people are looking for better training. In a Chinese factory town, there are many private courses: English classes, typing classes, technical classes. In Zhejiang I met Luo Shouyun, who had spent a quarter of his wages on training. Now he is a master machinist, with a salary that makes him 'middle class’. Another young man had learned Arabic in order to translate for Middle Eastern buyers.
Clearly there are environmental costs from China's rapid growth. Collaboration between China and other countries will be crucial in managing environmental problems. Nobody in the developed world should criticise China without taking a look in the mirror. The nation has become successful by making products for overseas consumers. There's nothing foreign about the materialistic dreams of the average Chinese worker.
