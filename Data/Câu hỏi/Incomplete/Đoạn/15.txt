Alfie,
Can you send Mrs.Sanders the new samples as soon as possible? She has called me 1.------- every day this week, including Saturday, and I feel like I am being 2.-------. She has already seen most of the samples in my catalog, but she wants to see the newer materials. I have no time to fix something up myself, so I'd really appreciate your 3.-------. There is a file on my desk with all the information.
Please take it if you need to check any details. Call me after you send the samples.
Thanks,
Ada
