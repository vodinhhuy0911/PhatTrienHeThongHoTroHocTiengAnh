Thank you for your 1.------- letter. I am sorry that you have had problems with your new Tondai Series-S laptop. We have had similar complaints from three other customers. We have 2.------- at your computer and tested it carefully. However, we cannot find the cause of the trouble. We would like to exchange your computer for another. You may have either the same series again or a new computer from the T series. 
Please contact me at the above telephone number, and let us know what you would like. I am very sorry for 3.------- inconvenience.
Sincerely, Eric Winters
