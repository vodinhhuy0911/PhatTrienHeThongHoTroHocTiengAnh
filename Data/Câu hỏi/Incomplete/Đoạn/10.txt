Comments
This is the first 1.------- I have eaten at Pentagon's. However, I think it will also be the last. I had to wait thirty minutes for my food. I had to ask the waitress four times before she brought water to our table. I 2.------- not enjoy a conversation with my friend because of the noise from the kitchen. The staff 3.------- shouting and yelling at each other the whole time. I asked to speak to the manager, but he was not available. The food was very good, but not good enough to make me want to return to any of your restaurants.
