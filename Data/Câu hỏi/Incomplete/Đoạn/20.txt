Thank you 1.------- your recent order. I am pleased to inform you that the items you ordered are now available. Please call the store as soon as you get this letter. We will hold the items 2.------- June 3". However, if you we do not hear from you before then, we have to send them 3.------- to the supplier. Normally, we hold items for just fourteen days, but since you are a regular customer, we are giving you a special extension.
Thank you, as always, for shopping at Paper H Pens. Sincerely,
