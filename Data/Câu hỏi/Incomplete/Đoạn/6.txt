Hi Sally,
I just wanted you to know about the delivery of cotton for the dresses you are making. I'm sorry for the delay, but it is now ready to 1.-------. It will arrive about 1 p.m. on Friday, August 6th. I 2.------- to the supplier, but he denied receiving the order. In fact, I had to place the order again, but this time there were no problems. Please let me know if it does not arrive on Friday. I hope you are 3.------- the summer weather.
Sincerly,
Alice Carer
