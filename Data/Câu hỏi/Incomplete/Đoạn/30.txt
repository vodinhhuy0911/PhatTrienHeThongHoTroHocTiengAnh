RE: Waste disposal

It has come to my 1.------- that we have been spending too much money on paper over the past year. 2.-------, most of the paper in our office that we throw in the trash can be recycled, which will in turn save us money. We can also use both sides of the paper for un important documents, and that means less trash. Less trash means that we cut down on our waste disposal expenses. We will also be buying less paper. This makes so much more sense 3.------- and environmentally. 
This is why we have decided to start a paper recycling program. I will distribute a list of the type of paper items in our office that can be recycled. If you have any used paper on the list, please dispose of it in the specially marked bins near the employee lounge. 
Thank you for your cooperation. 
Regards, 
Mark Schimidt, CFO
