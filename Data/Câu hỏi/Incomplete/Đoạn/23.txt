Dear Mr.Conrad,
I am writing to you 1.------- the contract we made last week. In the contract, you promised 2.------- use any workers without consulting me first. However, this morning I found two new workers on the building site. I 3.------- met them before, and I was not told about them. I do not want a repeat of this. Please honor our contract. I am very disappointed by this.
