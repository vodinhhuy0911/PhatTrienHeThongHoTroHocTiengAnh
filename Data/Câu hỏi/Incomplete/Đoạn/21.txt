Lucy,
Can you ask the cleaner to empty all the trash cans before she goes home every night? 1.-------	every morning this week, I have found the trash can in my office full of trash. Also, she should check that there is 2.------- toilet paper in the restrooms. Last week, we ran out of toilet paper every day. It is very inconvenient and 3.------- keeps complaining to me.
Thanks for your help,
Carrie
