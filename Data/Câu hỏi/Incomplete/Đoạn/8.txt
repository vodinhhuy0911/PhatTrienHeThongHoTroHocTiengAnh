Dear Ms. Burns,
Thank you for your recent enquiries about “Woodworks.” Woodworks 1.------- a small family-owned company. We are in our sixth year of business. We specialize in hand-carved pieces. We 2.------- local wood and make sure three trees are planted to replace every tree we use. Woodworks has its own forest, and all of our products are made from trees that grow there. As you say, we are a little expensive. However, we make a unique, high-quality product. Every piece we make is designed individually. It takes about six months to make 3.------- of our products. Of course, this costs a lot of money.
Please enjoy the enclosed catalog.
Sincerely,
Emma Richards
