We are announcing a new return policy on all apparel, both men’s and women’s. Cash refunds require a cash register receipt and all clothing tags must be intact and attached to the garments. Clothing must be returned within 30 days to be eligible for a cash refund. Refunds after 30 days will be made in the form of merchandise exchange only. For an exchange, a receipt is not required. 3.-------, you will only be credited for the current price of the item. We regret any inconvenience the new return policy may create. Thank you for your cooperation.
