Re: Christmas sales target
Date: October 15th
It is time to start thinking 1.------- our Christmas sales. Last year, we saw very low profits, so we really need to improve things this year. The store wants to double its profits, so we have a lot of work to do. We will have a meeting next Tuesday at three o'clock to discuss this. Please think of some good ideas to increase sales. If we reach the new target, 2.------- will get a bonus. If we are not successful, there will be no bonuses. The store manager will come to the meeting. He is going to 3.------- us his ideas and listen to our opinions.
This is a very important meeting. Don't miss it.
