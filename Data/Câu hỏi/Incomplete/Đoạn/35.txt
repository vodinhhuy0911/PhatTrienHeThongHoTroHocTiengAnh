Dear Mrs. Waters,

I am writing to provide formal notice of my resignation from Fielders Pharmacy. My last day will be February 14th, 2009.

I trust that two weeks is sufficient notice for you to find a 1.------- for my position. 
I would be 2.------- to help train the individual you choose to take my place.

Thank you for employing me for the past three years. My experience as clerk, supervisor, and floor manager has been very 3.------- and I'm confident that I will use many of the skills I have learned at Fielders in the future.

If you have any concerns, please contact me at my personal email address. 
All the best,

Annie Wright
