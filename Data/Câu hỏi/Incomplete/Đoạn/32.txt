To the Users of Prosonic TV Sets. 

We sincerely apologize for the 1.------- raised among the users of our television sets.
The few incidents of fires caused by defective parts have been traced to a particular transformer used in a limited number of sets made between January and February of 2008. If you own a 21-inch Brightron manufactured between January and February of 1995, please bring it in to a Prosonic dealer 2.------- a free replacement of the parts before April 30, 2008. 
Prosonic will make every effort to correct the defect and not let a similar product defect 3.------- again. We thank you for your patronage. 

Masayoshi Takada
President, Prosonic Corporation.
