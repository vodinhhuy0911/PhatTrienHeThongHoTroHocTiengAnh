Hi Everyone,
As you know, the office halloween party is coming up. As usual, we will have a costume competition. It is a 1.------- for you all to have some fun and win some great prizes. The party starts at 6 p.m. on Friday, October 30th. We will be closing the office early, so you will have one hour to get 2.-------. I am looking forward to some great costumes. This year, the first prize is free membership at the company sports club for one year. Second prize is dinner 3.------- the Magic Chef restaurant for four people. See you on the 30th.
