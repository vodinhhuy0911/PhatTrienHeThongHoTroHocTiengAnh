Dear Mr. Williams, 
This is to let you know that we 1.------- your cancellation of your purchase order. 
We also understand the reasons for your cancellations, as detailed in your letter. I'm very sorry about the problems you 2.------- while trying to order our products.
It seems that our online system overcharged other customers, too. This experience has shown us that we need to work on our online shop to make it more efficient. We are doing everything possible to ensure that this problem doesn't happen again. 
We value you as a customer, and your satisfaction is our biggest 3.-------. 
I have enclosed a coupon for 50 percent off any future purchase if you ever decide to shop with us again. 
I hope you accept my sincerest apologies. 

Truly yours,
