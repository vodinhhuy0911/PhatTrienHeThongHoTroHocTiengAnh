Dear customer,

Effective May 20, all shipments by Surety, Inc. to our exchange terminals 1.------- by overnight express. This new procedure will continue through the end of August, 2.------- we will revert to our normal shipping guidelines. We, not our customers, will bear this additional cost as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure customer 3.-------.
This express shipping procedure should allow us to process the backlog of orders generated by the increased media exposure with regard to the Midland situation. If you have questions about arrival dates on your orders, continue to deal directly with your normal contacts.

We want you to know we truly value you as a customer.
