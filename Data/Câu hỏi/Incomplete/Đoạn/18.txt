Re: Deadline
Date: January 28th, 2007
Sorry, folks. This is just to let you know that the deadline for the new grammar book has been changed. The new deadline is much 1.------- than the old one, so you will have to finish everything much 2.------- than you expected. The date has been brought forward to March 13th, instead of May 2nd as originally planned. There is some good news, however. Because of the new deadline and the increased stress, you will be getting a raise. We will 3.------- you $200 more than normal. If the book is successful, you will have a permanent raise of $50 per month.

Questions:
1.__more soon__soonest__sooner__sooner or later (C)
2.__quicker__quickly__quick__as quick as (A)
3.__rase__earn__support__pay (D)
