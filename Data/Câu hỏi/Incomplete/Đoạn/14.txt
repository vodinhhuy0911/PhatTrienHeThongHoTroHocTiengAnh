We regret to inform you that we have to close 1.------- new staff cafeteria. We do not know when we can 2.------- it again. Yesterday, twenty people became very sick after eating their lunch at the cafeteria. They have severe food poisoning. Most of them are now OK, but some of them are still in the hospital. This is terrible news, so to protect your health, we have 3.------- to close the cafeteria. The sandwich store in the basement will stay open. There have not been any problems with their food products. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope you all stay healthy.
