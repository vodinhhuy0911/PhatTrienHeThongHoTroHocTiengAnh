Dear Sally,
I am going to 1.------- grandmother's house this afternoon. I will be out when you get home from school, so you will need to get your own dinner. Help yourself 2.------- anything in the refrigerator. There is some cheese and plenty of vegetables. There is bread, too. You can pick 3.------- apples from the tree in the garden if you want. As a special treat, I have bought some chocolate fudge ice cream. Don't cat too much â€” I want to try some, too! Do your homework, OK? I'll be home about eight o'clock. See you later.
Mom
